[11-Jun-18 05:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <VirtualSoundNW> We do have a web based explorer at https://explorer.veruscoin.io/ which shows you the total network hash power among other things.


[11-Jun-18 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <JohnWestbrook> woot woot!


[11-Jun-18 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <pondsea> wow 14gh


[11-Jun-18 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <pondsea> 15.6 now


[11-Jun-18 07:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <miketout> üòÆ hash rate. wow


[11-Jun-18 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <pondsea> I dont know mike there might be a GPU out there üòõ


[11-Jun-18 07:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <pondsea> Or someone going crazy on amazon


[11-Jun-18 07:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <lil Komodo> Anyone here know which settings for amazon LOL..


[11-Jun-18 07:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <lil Komodo> theres so many its confusing the fuck outta me

[11-Jun-18 07:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <miketout> someone with Amazon's biggest servers maybe... anything's possible... just before time locks came on, i saw it get up to 18 GH/s briefly on the explorer, and we didn't have GPUs then for sure


[11-Jun-18 07:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <pondsea> ah ok


[11-Jun-18 07:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <miketout> i think two things are happening... one, we are getting a rise in hash power, and two, we are getting perceived higher hash power than it is sometimes when that happens because of compensation for POS. when it's an issue of compensation, it's not a bad thing, IMO at all. when they happen at the same time, it might look like a bigger burst than it is. i'm curious what we settle at.


[11-Jun-18 07:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <miketout> right now, it looks like we're already somewhat here/settled.


[11-Jun-18 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <miketout> we're near final on the white paper, so if people like it, we might get a little busier soon. maybe it will calm down when we get to the 192 blocks. at least we'll also announce a bounty soon for some unlocked coins. reddit, twitter, and FB pages ready to open up as soon as we release the white paper. it would be great if people from the community could follow Verus on twitter, talk about the white paper on reddit, and like Verus on FB when that happens.
right now, i think we hit a rise due to combined incoming hash rate and POS. we will see a drop at the next block, I'm pretty sure.


[11-Jun-18 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <miketout> yes. i'd guess the real number is closer to 13-14 GH/s right now


[11-Jun-18 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <miketout> we'll see in the next few blocks


[11-Jun-18 07:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <ted> Sounds great.

[11-Jun-18 10:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <AkiraX> if i have more verus do i have a better chance at staking?


[11-Jun-18 10:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <hansen.ng> yes, you would have a better chance.


[11-Jun-18 10:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <kamikraze> whats the code to point to single address across multiple machines again?


[11-Jun-18 10:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <englal> I think you're looking for -pubkey


[11-Jun-18 10:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <kamikraze> yes


[11-Jun-18 10:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <kamikraze> can you point me to that?


[11-Jun-18 10:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <englal> Hmm - I'm not sure where or if it is documented. Just pass it a public key for an address you have in another wallet. You can get the pubkey using the validateaddress CLI/RPC command.


[11-Jun-18 10:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <kamikraze> validateaddress

[11-Jun-18 10:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <kamikraze> wrong cli format


[11-Jun-18 10:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <englal> Ah, I don't believe pubkey works using cli/rpc. I believe verusd has to be invoked with the pupkey parameter in the command line or in the config file


[11-Jun-18 10:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <kamikraze> so what should i type?


[11-Jun-18 11:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <miketout> you need to set -pubkey=<66 char hex pubkey> when you first run verusd, so:
./verusd -gen -pubkey=<66 char hex pubkey>

[KMD-Discord] <Norain> help ??


[12-Jun-18 12:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <Norain> 1000 confirm ?


[12-Jun-18 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <englal> Hi @Norain, coins mined right now are time locked for a random number of blocks within a range. Immature blocks can't be spent or used for staking. The number next to mature tells you how long it will be until the transaction is unlocked, in blocks.


[12-Jun-18 12:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <Norain> so when i have coin in my balance


[12-Jun-18 12:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <englal> Expand the Direction column so you can see the number next to immature.

[KMD-Discord] <Norain> second or block ?


[12-Jun-18 12:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <englal> Block, and the block time is 1 minute.


[12-Jun-18 12:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <englal> The range is from 3 months to 2 years and 3 months, approximately.

[KMD-Discord] <Norain> üò¶


[12-Jun-18 12:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <Norain> why so long


[12-Jun-18 12:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <englal> To give us a chance to reward early miners with large coinbases, create a community of those people who all have an itnerest in the coin succeeding, and prevent quick selloff of early coins.


[12-Jun-18 12:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <englal> They can't be spent by anyone, even the devs, as these are coins we all mine together.


[12-Jun-18 12:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[KMD-Discord] <englal> As soon as the block reward has dropped to 96 the newly mined coins won't be locked any more.

[15-Jun-18 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <hansen.ng> i would suggest starting the pool after the reward reach 96 , because of the timelocked constraint.


[15-Jun-18 01:35 PM] jl777c#5810
by then hashrate could be 100GH and a pool will be needed for sure


[15-Jun-18 01:38 PM] $tefano.#3560
i will do it in the next days ( dev test too ), than when you would be start,  i will publish it

no hurry for now


[15-Jun-18 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <miketout> two things to consider when setting up a pool...
1) Currently, rewards are timelocked for a random time that can range from a couple months from now to two years and a couple months. Your pool will need to figure out how to distribute mining rewards with that constraint that we all have to deal with
2) When time locks are no longer applied, pools could differentiate themselves by moving rewards into stakeable addresses quickly and distributing staking rewards on funds that have yet to be disbursed
we will be working on pool support in a more focused way before the halving to 96, and we hope if someone does pool-related work prior to that, that they consider these points

[discord] <Theo> Do kmd holders receive any for free?


[15-Jun-18 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <miketout> @Theo We fully intend over time to support the Komodo platform's integration of technolgies like VerusHash, Verus PoS, advanced Verus parameters, and more for other Komodo platform coins that may want these advances, so in that way, KMD holders and the Komodo platform can benefit from Verus being on the platform. Other than that, as a fair launch coin, we ALL get coins from mining/staking. We, the devs, do plan to donate a large portion of our mining/staking earnings to support the project, but we're not ready to announce specifics, as we're still working on that. Until then, we are offering some community bounties, which we will continue to expand, so we can scale community involvement in the project.

@miketout thank you for your consideration on pool


[15-Jun-18 11:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <miketout> Hi @svarog , it definitely sounds like you aren't running the background server, which could be caused by a few things. usually, this is lack of supported instructions on the CPU.
Can you check that your CPU has both "aes" and "avx" flags with the program cpu-z at http://cpuid.com ?


[15-Jun-18 11:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Svarog> @miketout  aes  yes avx is not


[15-Jun-18 11:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Svarog> need to maintain instructions aes and avx simultaneously. or enough aes


[16-Jun-18 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <miketout> it needs both right now. that will change soon, but only for staking.


[16-Jun-18 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <lionmg> Hi is Verus available on an exchange anywhere? how can a non-miner obtain some?


[16-Jun-18 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <miketout> üòÉ


[16-Jun-18 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <miketout> I *just* posted in the trading channel to ask people if they'd like to join us (devs) in getting Verus onto an exchange. we're going to wait to hear from the community, but once we submit a non-accelerated application to crypto-bridge, we should be tradable from within 7 to 24 days, as I understand it.


[16-Jun-18 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <miketout> we'll donate to the cause, at least matching other community donations with 1/2 bitcoin, which is the listing fee for crypto-bridge, and if we get enough response without raising enough, we may donate more
we have applied to Bittrex, but that is the first step, and is unknown/can take some time. we are also engaging a legal firm to help prepare Verus Coin for other larger exchanges as well.


[16-Jun-18 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <lionmg> sounds good. does donating to help the exchange fund come with any coins in return?


[16-Jun-18 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <pondsea> Crypto bridge is a centralised service deceiving regular users to think they are a dex, best not to reward that


[16-Jun-18 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <miketout> @lionmg as co-miners and stakers who don't plan to sell a bunch of coins, our interest in donating the 1/2 bitcoin would be to enable liquidity for the good of the coin while making the largest donations ourselves as members of the community also. we are offering to at least match the rest of the community's contributions out of our own mining and staking earnings, and what everyone gets in return is the ability to easily buy and sell Verus on an exchange.


[16-Jun-18 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <lionmg> fair enough, I wish I had some already. I'll buy some when it's on the exchange üëç

1st week:  Block 1 -> 10080 = 1,935,360 VRSC
1st month: Block 10080 -> 53280 = 384 VRSC = 16,588,800 VRSC
2nd month: Block 53280 -> 96480 = 192 VRSC = 8,294,400 VRSC
3rd month: Block 96480 -> 139680 = 96 VRSC = 4,147,200 VRSC
4th month: Block 139680 -> 182880 = 48 VRSC = 2,073,600 VRSC
5th month: Block 182880 -> 226080 = 24 VRSC = 1,036,800 VRSC

[17-Jun-18 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <englal> @jimboscott When your wallet is created, it has a keypool of 100 or so addresses in it. Any time you request a new address to receive to, need a change address when you send funds, or solve a new block via PoW, it will select an unused address from that keypool, an address already in the wallet, and use it. Once it has been used it will show up in the wallet.

[discord] <jl777c> current marketcap depends mostly on the value of the locked coins. There is a floor amount of several million dollars of the unlocked coins, but with 20x more locked coins, it could easily end up as tens of millions, before phase 2 is released

I honestly feel like the algorithm verus created due to it cpu only has great merit for the ecosystem possibly replacing equihash on kmd in the future. Also isn't verushash quantum resistant. Granted I plan to hold verus and see where this project grows.

When I get back from the meetup I'm going to point my r7 1800x and laptop at it and see if I can find some of these early blocks.

[discord] <Shaun> i have 3 pcs and update all my gui wallet form old wallet backup


[18-Jun-18 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Shaun> But the data of each wallet are different, including quantity, transaction records.


[18-Jun-18 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Shaun> how to deal with that?


[18-Jun-18 10:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <TexWiller> Your wallet uses a keypool: when it starts, it creates a bunch of keys and, for each transasction, one address is being used. If your wallet generates more key after a backup, they are not included in the old backup. How have you imported the backups?


[18-Jun-18 10:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Shaun> i just backup my wallet.dat   
And then replace the new wallet file


[18-Jun-18 10:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <TexWiller> if you make a backup at 10.00AM and your wallet mines a new block at 11.00AM using a new address (assuming that your previous addresses were all used), this block will not be in your backup. Also, to merge wallets, you can't copy multiple wallet.dat (each one is being overwrited by the other). Have a look in faq section, there's a procedure for merging (z_exportwallet & z_kmportwallet)


[18-Jun-18 10:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Shaun> ok thanks for your reply

Normal not to have listtransactions filled if blocks mined are immature after reimporting wallet / reindexing ?


[18-Jun-18 11:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
Rescan needed maybe


[18-Jun-18 11:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
Even after a rescan the tx seems wasn t found / added to wallet


[18-Jun-18 11:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
As the tx is on blockchain not a big deal but would like to be able to query listtransactions from any point of mining

seems I got my own answer for address with locked funds, seems funds are deposited on a "sort" of changeaddress. At least it isn't on main.
One question I have then : are those address derived from main one (the one generated with the priv), or just on the fly generated when mining is succesful : 
Derivative would mean reimporting just the priv could make it, but just on the fly would mean they re just locked in specific wallet.dat, then would have to collect all .dat from multiple mining machines waiting for a possible transfer to T-address. 

How does it really work then : Do we have to make regular backups of wallet.dat or just keeping the priv is enough ?


[19-Jun-18 04:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
speaking with it with blackjok3r : seems it s a b address, waiting for the "contract" of mature comes to reality when the lock is reached, but could you confirm it ? that would mean only the priv is needed, and no need to keep multiple wallet.dat


[19-Jun-18 05:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <miketout> It is not derived. It is a key pool, and the address listed on listttransactions is the address to save the privkey of. I believe TexWiller‚Äôs solution for dumping and merging wallets listed in faq-chosen is the most convenient way to merge wallets.


[19-Jun-18 05:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
thanks, should have mined with pubkey, too late now, very clear. Sorry for those questions, you made me learn something new today. Thanks

[19-Jun-18 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> Seems if the priv key is never revealed, one could still maintain a secret ballot while the entire process could be completely transparent.  Am I right or wrong on this potential?

just downloaded the versus agama wallet and have a hash rate of 1.359 mega hash. Its going to take me 8 days to find a block üòÇ


[20-Jun-18 01:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> is there a chart of overall hashrate over time? it feels as if it is gaining 5% every day


[20-Jun-18 02:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <TexWiller> @jl777c  I'm working on some analytics dashboards; as now I have only historical data (blocks & transactions); I'm afraid there's no way to retrieve hashrate


[20-Jun-18 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <TexWiller> I have the difficulty for each block; is that approach correct:
```
expected_blocks_in_a_day = 1440
avg_difficulty_for_X_day = XXXX
blocks_found_in_X_day = XXX
hash_rate = (blocks_found/expected_blocks*difficulty * 2**32 / 600)
```

????


[20-Jun-18 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> there is a way to convert from diff to hashrate, just not sure the exact formula. having a chart of diff will show the comparable to hashrate

[discord] <jl777c> looks great and seems to fit what I remember about the hashrate. It sure looks like a steady organic increase


[20-Jun-18 04:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <TexWiller> I've took the ActualDifficulty / ActualNetworkHashrate and derived a coefficient of "2.64199"; the chart formula is:
NetworkHashrate = (AvgDifficulty / 2.64199) / 1000000000


[20-Jun-18 04:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> we can use this to detect secret GPU miners as if such a thing existed there would be a very steep increase and it would look like a stair step

[discord] <idrtis> lets say I have 100 staking VRSC and I send someone 10 VRSC, would I wait 150 blocks again for the staking for the rest 90 coins?


[20-Jun-18 04:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <miketout> @idrtis it's possible, but not necessarily so. the reason is that if you have one unspent transaction output (UTXO) that is 10 Verus, the other 90 would be untouched and continue staking. If you have one UTXO that is 100, 10 will go to the receiver, and the other 90 will also be sent to a change address, which will reset its age.

[discord] <Shaun> great


[20-Jun-18 10:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <karero> @jl777c I‚Äôd expect a dip in the network hash rate when rewards half as some miners might be tempted to reallocate resources, wouldn‚Äôt you? If there‚Äôs no dip then that would be an extremely positive sign.


[20-Jun-18 11:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> it would be unlikely that hashrate doesnt fall at the halving, then again with other coins the hashrate doesnt really change so much at halving


[20-Jun-18 11:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> i dont think BTC hashrates goes in half at halving, rather the price tends to go up due to less incoming supply. here it is still locked, so totally new territory


[21-Jun-18 01:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <karero> Yepp. Only 10 more days ...

[21-Jun-18 07:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <osta> if yes, it can take days or week. Depend if you are lucky or not


[21-Jun-18 08:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> Can locked coins be moved to another wallet by exporting Private Keys?


[21-Jun-18 08:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> yes, coins dont actually exist inside a wallet. a wallet is just a way to view coins that are on the blockchain


[21-Jun-18 08:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> OK - then how do I do it?   I see nothing anywhere on how to move immature coins from one wallet to another.


[21-Jun-18 08:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> The steps for getting the Priv key do not work as described for other coins.


[21-Jun-18 08:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> As I possibly understand it - it may not be possible to do this with immature coins because locking them means... they are not really mine on the blockchain...


[21-Jun-18 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> Not yet.


[21-Jun-18 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> but if you know the address that mined it, you can dumpprivkey for that address, importprivkey in a different wallet


[21-Jun-18 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> the wallet wont know that it was or wasnt the original. possession of the privkey is possession of the coins


[21-Jun-18 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> maybe the actual address is not clear, but it is encoded in the OP_RETURN that has the redeemscript for the p2sh address, which is basically a standard <locktime> CLTV OP_DROP <normal script>


[21-Jun-18 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> By the time I figure that out...  my coins will all be mature...


[21-Jun-18 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> May I just copy all my wallet.dat files for backups.


[21-Jun-18 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> maybe


[21-Jun-18 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> No.... YOU can.... not me - necessarily


[21-Jun-18 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> given the normal script you can calculate the address üòÉ


[21-Jun-18 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> maybe just doing listtransactions will  just display the address


[21-Jun-18 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> is that a CLI command?


[21-Jun-18 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <jl777> yes


[21-Jun-18 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <jl777> i know very scary


[21-Jun-18 08:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> possession of the privkey is possession of the coins - true - but when the coins are locked.... I really do not possess them....


[21-Jun-18 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <englal> @jimboscott They're yours, no one else will ever be able to spend them, they just have a condition attached to them. They aren't liquid, but they're yours.


[21-Jun-18 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> Got that.  Using the GUI Agama wallet, the steps for exporting the Private keys for a transaction are not available it seems...


[21-Jun-18 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> Maybe I just need to backup my wallet.dat files on all my boxes and forget about trying to move all to one wallet.


[21-Jun-18 08:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <englal> We'll have to take a look at that. In the mean time if you go to settings and scroll to the bottom, there's an interface where you can run CLI commands. I would expect it to work if you use the command:

dumpprivkey "address"


[21-Jun-18 08:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <englal> *of course, replacing address with the address you want the private key for


[21-Jun-18 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> That did give me a response.... thanks.   Now I will try to import that key...


[21-Jun-18 09:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> OK - apparently the Priv key is not the right format...  nothing happened when i imported it.


[21-Jun-18 09:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> I got the Priv Key - and it said 'imported' but no change in the wallet.


[21-Jun-18 09:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> Ideas?


[21-Jun-18 09:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> I did a rescan too.


[21-Jun-18 09:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <englal> It doesn't give much output on operations like that, so I'm not surprised it didn't appear to do anything. The rescan should have made those show up though. Which way did you import the private key, and how did you initiate the rescan?


[21-Jun-18 09:23 AM] Gateway#3763

[discord] <jimboscott> Also shut the wallet down and restarted it - no change


[21-Jun-18 09:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> But, I pasted the raw Priv key.   Not sure if WIF is different or how I get it.


[21-Jun-18 09:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <englal> Just in case, would you mind trying on the CLI in settings?

importprivkey "private key" rescan


[21-Jun-18 09:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> OK


[21-Jun-18 09:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <englal> To be honest, I only use the CLI personally and have limited experience with Agama, so while I'm the one here right now I'm not the best guy for help on Agama stuff. üòõ


[21-Jun-18 09:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> CLI returned the destination address but transaction not imported into the wallet.


[21-Jun-18 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> I am sort of thinking the locked status is making it impossible to move from wallet to wallet.


[21-Jun-18 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> Otherwise I could be trading locked coins and defeating the purpose.


[21-Jun-18 09:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> Backing up the wallet.dat file is going to be the way to go here.  I can keep track of 5 of them OK.


[21-Jun-18 10:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Jam> Is there an exchange for this coin

[21-Jun-18 11:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <miketout> @jimboscott you can see the destination address to use for dumpprivkey for every transaction either in your Agama wallet by clicking on the magnifying glass next to the transaction, or through the listtransactions command, either from the </> CLI section in settings menu of the Agama wallet, or the actual command line. Generally, you can use the </> CLI in settings or the actual command line to run commands not supported in the Agama GUI.
@TexWiller had posted an FAQ submission, which is in #faq-chosen and will be part of the full FAQ in the future. I'm copying it here, just to make it easy to find:
Q: How to consolidate multiple wallet.dat files in one?
 
Answer:
1) Edit the VRSC.conf file on each instance you have, adding the following line: exportdir=/LOCAL_PATH/ (ie /home/user/)
2) Restart verusd
3) Issue the following command (on the verus-cli): z_exportwallet FILENAME (ie z_exportwallet export_instance01)
4) Copy the generated file to the machine who host your main wallet
5) Issue the following command (on the "main" verus-cli): z_importwallet /LOCAL_PATH/FILENAME (ie /home/user/export_instance01)


[21-Jun-18 11:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jimboscott> Cool - thanks.  I did manage to export the WIF private key into a second wallet with success, but your method will work better when dealing with a more global approach.


[21-Jun-18 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <miketout> actually, I can't take credit for that. Tex posted it üòâ , I'm glad you have a way, and I hope that works for you as well


[21-Jun-18 12:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <TexWiller> a lot of people are concerned about wallet.dat security; my advice, assuming you only have access to an home desktop, is: create a free tier instance on cloud (google/aws/azure). Use the firewall to restrict acces only from you IP and only to port 22,  disable password auth and use a ssh key (with passphrase), use a 2fa to access your cloud env. If you're in paranoid mode, create a new account (ie a new google account) and use only for it. If you already have a ledger nano, you can use it as 2fa. All of the above is free of charge and you can have a complete peace of mind üòâ Also, use only a linux minimal instance without gui.


[21-Jun-18 12:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> just mine to pubkey that is only on a computer you have physical control over


[21-Jun-18 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <TexWiller> @jl777c true, but how an avg user can have physical control over a daily used PC? Imho, cloud allows to use dedicated instances and reduce near to 0 all security issues. Lastly, you can create crossplatform encrypted backups (ie from aws to gcloud) and you can be absolutely sure you will not lose your wallet


[21-Jun-18 12:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> well i guess if you are saying about windows computers, i didnt mean to say keep it on windows as that is quite insecure without some serious efforts (or disconnecting it from the internet). so yes if you arent running a more secure OS locally, then what you say is a good way


[21-Jun-18 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <pondsea> Best way is to get Ubuntu desktop, not a big learning curve, download agama, go to settings and do validate address. Get pub key and mine to that. Turn it off

[discord] <jl777c> and the first VRSC atomic swap has been done!


[22-Jun-18 11:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> this is at the cli level and there could still be some issues, but fundamentally it is proven that the atomic swap works (with unlocked transparent coins)

[23-Jun-18 10:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[slackkmd] <jl777> for now you need to importprivkey for you address into VRSC.  i had tested with a daemon with privkey already imported

[23-Jun-18 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[slackkmd] <Daemon> I have a buy order up and my swap was fine it is just BDEX not pulling in the info if the address is not fully exposed in AGAMA since Electrum isnt up for VRSC


[23-Jun-18 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> Will we at some point be able to use regular agama for other coins with verus?


[23-Jun-18 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <JoeCrypto> So, I was able to find a block with my slow cpu. 384 VRS, so now I have to wait 2years to unlock the coins? is that correct?


[23-Jun-18 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @JoeCrypto that could be correct.  How many blocks until your mined coins mature?


[23-Jun-18 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[slackkmd] <Daemon> There is a number next to the word Immature... that is roughly how many minutes until it is spendable... since 1 minute blocks.

[23-Jun-18 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> if I run mining with same `-pubkey` on two machines, which will send mining reward to same address would that affect anything on mining chances?


[23-Jun-18 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> means can this lower my chances of mining reward somehow?


[23-Jun-18 09:25 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@grewalsatinder it will send the mining rewards to the same address. It would be the same chance as mining to 2 different wallets


[23-Jun-18 09:25 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
cool! thanks mate üòÉ


[23-Jun-18 09:29 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Once there are pools then it will make a difference.

It will even out the luck and get the mining rewards back to ev


[23-Jun-18 10:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <elvinsophus> What about staking on two machines with the same wallet.dat? Will chance of getting a staked block double?

[24-Jun-18 09:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <elvinsophus> I'm in shit luck today again. No block was mined in over 26 consecutive hours with 37 MH/s hash rate, until 5 minutes ago. Never happened before.


[24-Jun-18 09:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> @TexWiller great stats. üëçüëè


[24-Jun-18 09:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TexWiller> ty, it's just an example; the goal, here, is to crunch as many data as possible to create meaningful views; something, imho, that is not so common in blockchain environment


[24-Jun-18 09:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> In the last 100 block stats What happened to the missing blocks (minutes)?


[24-Jun-18 09:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TexWiller> the query returns only mined blocks (where's the hashrate)


[24-Jun-18 09:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> Can you also get out if the blockchain the transaction volume? Not sure if that‚Äôs really interesting since people move coins between addresses...


[24-Jun-18 09:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> Ah so if the blick was not mined it‚Äôs minted?


[24-Jun-18 09:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> Another interesting stat I find is the fluctuation of the network hashrate during the day. It significant. I guess it follows a pattern. Wonder why, people letting their machines run over night?


[24-Jun-18 09:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TexWiller> @karero  refresh the page, just added daily total TXs


[24-Jun-18 09:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TexWiller> For the hashrate, I'm collecting detailed datapoint since today; for the historical, I still need help to calculate it from available datas


[24-Jun-18 09:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> Very cool üôÉ


[24-Jun-18 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> What‚Äôs included in the tx volume public to public tx for sure. Public to private & private to public as well? Do private to private tx exist? I guess so, those I assume are excluded, aren‚Äôt they?


[24-Jun-18 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <elvinsophus> I think the network hash rate does follow a pattern. During some time of the day I mined more blocks than during the other.


[24-Jun-18 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TexWiller> it's the count of txid fields


[24-Jun-18 09:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> Amazing how constant the daily tx volume hovers around 2500 VRSC


[24-Jun-18 09:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TexWiller> as now, the platform has all the fields from block (like getblock X) and transactions


[24-Jun-18 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TexWiller> I hope to retrieve some community feedback to improve it; haven't found (or haven't be able to üòÉ ) something to compare or to take as inspiration


[24-Jun-18 09:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> The txid fields should include private to public, public to private tx, shouldn‚Äôt they?


[24-Jun-18 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> For staking it would be very interesting to know the value of all funds in public addresses. Do people need to have their wallets online - or do you stake offline (the network stakes for you)? Is that something you could retrieve?


[24-Jun-18 09:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TexWiller> I should be able to retrieve addresses balance but I need to import all known addresses into the node (as watchonly). It may some take a day or so to import all the datas


[24-Jun-18 09:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> Wow. Thats great!


[24-Jun-18 10:01 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <TexWiller> Feedbacks or requests are very welcome!


[24-Jun-18 11:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> @TexWiller and you mentioned the difficulty goes hand in hand with the network hash rate, or something like that


[24-Jun-18 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <VirtualSoundNW> The difficulty is a moving average that adjusts to get to a 1 block per minute rate.  If the hash rate increases the block rate goes up, then over several samples the higher rate will cause the difficulty to go up, slowing the rate back down towards 1/minute.  Decreases in network hash slow the rate, triggering a decrease in difficulty over multiple samples to speed it back up towards 1 per minute.

[dscrdvrsc] <Sosky> i don't know where I can see how many days I have to wait before I can see it in my "transparent balance"m but that doesn't matter... I don't think I will touch this coin for two years...


[25-Jun-18 11:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sosky> One small question for the team


[25-Jun-18 11:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sosky> don't you think it's more appealing to call the coin just "verus" and give up on the "coin" part of the name? :/

Then you ll have blockmaturity ( i don t remember exactly) that s the amount of blocks needed to wait until it s in your wallet


[25-Jun-18 11:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
If you mined via cli... if that s with agama a call of listtransactions should be possible too but I don t know where to input it

[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> Anyone here old enough to remember PCs with turbo button on them?


[25-Jun-18 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <aelder> Yeah, and the Turbo button actually slowed them down.


[25-Jun-18 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <aelder> I guess it varied by company, but on ours, turbo was compatibility mode.

[26-Jun-18 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> The new version is up.


[26-Jun-18 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> Remember that if you're using compatibility mode you don't want this update. If your machine doesn't support the AES or AVX2 instructions please stay on v0.3.7


[26-Jun-18 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> In the next release we should have a fix for portability mode along side this accelerated mining code.


[26-Jun-18 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> @englal how do I upgrade? or do I need to build from scratch?


[26-Jun-18 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> The new releases are on the website at veruscoin.io


[26-Jun-18 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> so download the cli?


[26-Jun-18 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> You can either download them there and run or if you built before just do a git pull and build again.


[26-Jun-18 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> or can I upgrade my existing install that I compiled yesterday?


[26-Jun-18 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> That is probably your better bet


[26-Jun-18 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> so follow the same steps, but it will be quicker?


[26-Jun-18 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> or will it build from the beginning?


[26-Jun-18 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> just go into your veruscoin directory (not src) and run:
git pull
zcutil/build.sh


[26-Jun-18 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> Here's my update procedure (takes me 3 min for Linux CLI):


[26-Jun-18 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> (using TMUX: sudo apt-get install tmux + links2 Browser: sudo apt-get install links2)
It's important to stop mining before updating from what I understand.
links2 veruscoin.io
Navigate to Linux CLI and save
cd verus-cli
./verus stop
cd ..
tar -xzvf verus-cli-linux-v0.3.8.tar.gz
cd verus-cli
tmux
Launch komodo daemon for virus with 12 threads (set a the number of cores of your CPU, try doubling it later, maybe each of your core can do 2 threads)
./verusd -gen -genproclimit=12
[ctrl]&b d (to detach TMUX)
To check (in verus-cli directory):
./verus getmininginfo
To change threads (from outside the Verus process), e.g.
./verus setgenerate true 24


[26-Jun-18 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> It won't have as many dependencies to go out and fetch, and there are other steps it can skip, so it should build faster than the first time.


[26-Jun-18 08:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> ok, but generally installing the cli will be quicker?


[26-Jun-18 08:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> Yes, unless running on a system that has some dependency difficulties.


[26-Jun-18 08:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> ok, so less risky to stick with what i have


[26-Jun-18 08:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> I guess those won't have bene magically fixed yet üòâ


[26-Jun-18 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> been


[26-Jun-18 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> @englal how do I check it's finished?


[26-Jun-18 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> I mean, check the version


[26-Jun-18 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> also I did build.sh, not with the -j command? is that going to be a problem in terms of speed?


[26-Jun-18 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> j something, for thread/core number


[26-Jun-18 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> It depends on the machine, but it will probably be slower I really don't know how much slower, but the build shouldn't take very long even on a single thread if it isn't the first time building.


[26-Jun-18 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> ok, and how can I check the version afterwards?


[26-Jun-18 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> I guess I'll see I have more mhs for one thing üòâ


[26-Jun-18 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> That's going to be your clearest indicator. It won't be a small difference.


[26-Jun-18 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> ok


[26-Jun-18 09:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SevFC18> @englal Where can I find out how long it will take to mine a block at 38MH?


[26-Jun-18 09:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> There probably won't be an accurate way for a little while as the hashrate shoots up. The difficulty adjustement is going to be catching up with it, so underestimating hash power until it stabilizes a little bit.


[26-Jun-18 09:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> But in general you would use the getmininginfo command either in the cli or the cli section in Agama settings. That will give you your hash rate and a best estimate for network hash rate based on difficulty.


[26-Jun-18 09:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SevFC18> I'm still just trying to find my first lol


[26-Jun-18 09:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> You can then divide your rate by the network rate to find what percentage of the hash rate you are.


[26-Jun-18 09:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SevFC18> .002068


[26-Jun-18 09:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> I'm getting 50% increase, I read 20x was possible somewhere?


[26-Jun-18 09:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SevFC18> I went from 2MH to 40MH


[26-Jun-18 09:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> 0.002068 times 720 PoW blocks per day would mean that on average you should get 1.489 blocks per day. Again, that probably won't be the case since a large portion of the network is upgrading right now.


[26-Jun-18 09:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> @Hope_Trader If you haven't, give it a few minutes after starting up and check your hash rate again - it often takes a little while to stabilize and report correctly because of how it averages.


[26-Jun-18 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> ok


[26-Jun-18 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> yeah sometimes it's taken hours to find it's peak


[26-Jun-18 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> And make sure you're mining with the number of threads you expected.


[26-Jun-18 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> then on my am 2700 build it goes the other way


[26-Jun-18 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> and reported double what it's capable of üòÑ


[26-Jun-18 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> Yeah, it can take a while. It's not actually the hash rate settling, it's just in how it averages to calculate and report it.


[26-Jun-18 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> ok


[26-Jun-18 09:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> @englal getting timeout message


[26-Jun-18 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> Some of this may be happening because so many nodes are going offline to update.


[26-Jun-18 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> I don't have an answer at the moment other than to sit tight for a little bit and see if it resolves as more nodes come back up.


[26-Jun-18 09:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hope_Trader> ok thanks

[dscrdvrsc] <runningwithbeer> Forgive the stupid question - when do mined/staked coins become spendable/transferable to other wallets?


[26-Jun-18 11:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Meyse> went from 4.8 mhz to 45 mhz, its like black magic


[26-Jun-18 11:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Meyse> @runningwithbeer if you have immature blocks, go to more details, and look for blockstomaturity


[26-Jun-18 11:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Meyse> if you are mining/staking in the agama wallet


[26-Jun-18 11:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <runningwithbeer> Yes I am as that's the only way to mine isn't it? My oldest block shows 13544 confirms but my balnce is still zero


[26-Jun-18 11:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Meyse> click on the magnifying glass next to it


[26-Jun-18 11:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Meyse> there you will see a number next to blockstomaturity


[26-Jun-18 11:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <runningwithbeer> Blockstomaturity    237276


[26-Jun-18 11:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Meyse> you need to wait this many blocks until you can spend your mined/staked coins


[26-Jun-18 11:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <runningwithbeer> ok


[26-Jun-18 11:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Meyse> which is 237276 blocks = minutes


[26-Jun-18 11:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <runningwithbeer> so there is no particular date per se


[26-Jun-18 11:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Meyse> /60 is hours

[dscrdvrsc] <Moker> ok, but before we all get to exited; if your hashrate goes to the moon üöÄ  so is everyone esle's. 
The diff will rise and the outcome of your mining will be more or less the same as it was before üòã

btw I didn t need to make with last version, cause everything was just fresh, and it seems calling make clean even on the older commit number outputs the same exact error. Maybe we re not supposed to make clean, but that's what I've been doing with kmd for monthes now, so basically I mimicked the update steps

a gitpull with ./zcutil/build.sh -j8 is in progress, it seems that it won't stop, but... having that make errors made me ask here


[26-Jun-18 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> I'm not sure about make clean. I know I've always just rebuilt using zcutil/build.sh


[26-Jun-18 01:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
yeah, the make clean is a step I add on kmd everytime I checkout/pull. I'm not a coder, and not fully aware of what it changes without "make clean" and just rebuilding. Maybe that's just an unneeded step, but just in case...


[26-Jun-18 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> I haven't looked at the makefiles, but my guess would be that the build script and/or make both download files and store them so they don't need to be downloaded on future builds, and also store intermediate files and static libraries that it builds, so those don't have to be rebuilt unless updated. If those are the case, I would expect make clean to purge all of that, which you'd want if there's a problem with that cached info and prebuilt stuff, or if you want to free up disk space, but also means longer builds and more potential points of failure when you build next. I'm happy to be corrected if anyone has more correct or precise info.

[27-Jun-18 07:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TexWiller> the dashboard on website is updated @ loadtime


[27-Jun-18 07:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TexWiller> http://35.231.87.124:80


[27-Jun-18 07:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TexWiller> compute from today midnight; let me know if you need a narrow timeframe


[27-Jun-18 07:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> looking good!


[27-Jun-18 07:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> What strikes me as odd @TexWiller is that I thought there should be 1440 block rewards every day. Based on the graphic it looks more like 1850-1900. What am I getting wrong?


[27-Jun-18 07:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> I like the bottom part with the time to reward for the 3 CPUs üòÉ That's great info. I guess times will still go up a bit as more people move to the new version and network hash power will move up.


[27-Jun-18 07:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> (and may go down again when rewards will cut in half)


[27-Jun-18 07:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TexWiller> @karero uhm....let me check, I may have done something wrong


[27-Jun-18 08:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> so if all 384 rewards go to the miner.. how does the staking work?


[27-Jun-18 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> when does 50/50 pow/pos come into play


[27-Jun-18 08:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> there should in theory be 720 minted/stacked and 720 mined rewards. The exact ration varies from day to day. It used to 46/47% stacked and 53 or so % mined. With v0.3.8 it should be closer to 49/50 stacked and 50/51% mined.


[27-Jun-18 08:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> got it..


[27-Jun-18 08:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> second question.. how many confirmations are required before not immature.. Or will it stay immature until the end of the lock period?


[27-Jun-18 08:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Moker> @Gmoney correct, it stays locked


[27-Jun-18 08:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> oh is the number after Immature (xxxx) the lock time for that block?


[27-Jun-18 08:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Moker> yes, in minutes


[27-Jun-18 08:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> right.. block time is a minute


[27-Jun-18 08:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> @Gmoney If you are using CLI check out  @dukeleto's perl script. Its wonderful. https://github.com/leto/Util/blob/master/bin/block_maturity_dates.pl
(I had to correct one path for the CLI download version )

[27-Jun-18 08:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> I was wrong when I predicted 100GH by the start of unlocked 96 VRSC rewards


[27-Jun-18 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> I wonder if this backs off at all after this current halving?


[27-Jun-18 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> i dont think it will by much


[27-Jun-18 08:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> with the new hashing getting 50MH on decent systems, thats 20 nanoseconds per hash!, it is interesting that much older systems are getting close to the same and the fastest at 75MH or so. this update has really leveled the playing field. The ideal mining "rig" would seem to be a dozen old laptops instead of a GPU


[27-Jun-18 08:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> @jl777c very succint observation üòÉ


[27-Jun-18 08:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> I think you can buy a few dozen old laptops for the cost of a fancy GPU? not sure about current prices, but say 25 systems would get almost 1GH and it seems unlikely any GPU can get that sort of speed


[27-Jun-18 08:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> i3s to i7s are doing quite well.. but I cant get the pentium and celeron chips to mine at all..


[27-Jun-18 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> they get stuck on 'activating best chain' and I never get into mining with the pentium and celeron (even though they are newer builds)


[27-Jun-18 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> with i3/i5/i7 literally everywhere and in many low cost systems, it allows most anyone to get decent hashrate and the ambitiuous can go a bit crazy on eBay to build a farm


[27-Jun-18 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> That has some real beauty to it, I believe.


[27-Jun-18 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> if we see the hashrate rising linearly after the current surge, then I think that will be what is happening as people find long abandoned i5 systems to put them in service


[27-Jun-18 09:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TexWiller> is there any way to retrieve node location (bitcoin has getaddr)? Would be nice to look at geo diffusion of Verus


[27-Jun-18 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> getpeerinfo and do geoip


[27-Jun-18 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> but configure so you get a large numbe of peers, like the explorer has

[dscrdvrsc] <bitcoinB> has the updatew to increase hashpower been pushed and if so how to inpliment it please as im still getting 7.65m/hs on a i7 8700 12 threads


[27-Jun-18 09:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mavenL> @bitcoinB Why not read #announcements ? just update to the latest version


[27-Jun-18 10:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bitcoinB> yup thanks i did just that but wasnt 100% sure it was pushed ive updated to new walllet and still only getting same hash rate as before any advise ?


[27-Jun-18 10:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mavenL> are you sure you're using version 0.3.8?


[27-Jun-18 10:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mavenL> seem unlikely getting same hash rate

[dscrdvrsc] <bitcoinB> yup 100% problem now solved thanks


[27-Jun-18 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bitcoinB> in terms of staking what are the rewards like i was thinking of stakeing on another wallet

FYI I fell I had scalability issues yesterday with multiple threads on xeon, switching to DEV branch fixed it, it may not be the best solution, as DEV is not obviously intended to be as stable as MASTER, but it made me go from 13M to 226M

[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> the latest upgrade for my newest i7 wasnt a 14x though..  6x on the high side of newer i7.. perhaps some of the 8-12 core processors can achieve a much larger multiple..


[27-Jun-18 11:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> so this video above I think was before the 038 upgrade right? So its the 038 + 039 upgrades combined which would be a more significant bump

[dscrdvrsc] <karero> yes, it works copy the wallet. Make sure to make backups though... I am not sure if you add an address to one wallet ‚Äì I guess won't be sync'ed to the other, so be careful


[28-Jun-18 01:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <shaman_ns> Thanks @karero. What do you mean "copy the wallet"? Do you mean the seed/private key? Sorry, noob here...


[28-Jun-18 01:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> The whole wallet.data usually in the .komodo > VRSC folder


[28-Jun-18 01:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TexWiller> @karero for sure! when you backup a wallet.dat  and new keys are added to the keypool they reside only in the wallet that has geenerated them


[28-Jun-18 01:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <shaman_ns> Ok, so I basically copy the `wallet.dat` file into the other wallet. Got it!

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Thank you @TexWiller !
On another topic, based on the significant rise in hash rate, I think we can safely say that if there were any GPU miners active, they have been completely out hashed by this upgrade üòÉ sometime, we will find out if GPUs can keep up with this. if they can, i am doubtful that they'll be competitive at similar power draw. hopefully CPUs will now be useful miners for quite some time


[28-Jun-18 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> @miketout. Has anyone ever mentioned how coincidental the timing of the upgrade was?


[28-Jun-18 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> Same time as halfing?


[28-Jun-18 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> Was this for marketing purposes?


[28-Jun-18 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> We were forced into the timing. Someone working on a GPU miner first led me to believe that GPUs were going to be a threat to CPUs and then also discovered that this was possible and mined at least one block with the the method. Prior to that, we had left the option to close this method off or use it at some point. We had to decide immediately, and after a lot of calculating, determined that providing it to everyone would be the best chance to keep CPUs viable indefinitely, so we chose that option. Exact timing was coincidental and definitely not the most convenient personally. End result is better than I thought it would be on perf, which I guess is good for those of us in the community who would like to see Verus succeed üòÉ

[28-Jun-18 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Norain> Mine one wallet??


[28-Jun-18 07:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Norain> Copy wallet ??


[28-Jun-18 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> @Norain You can copy a wallet between the computers, but be aware that after a time they may generate new addresses that aren't common between them. The safest way to do it, if you're using the CLI is to use the pubkey parameter.


[28-Jun-18 07:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> On linux, for instance, you would start verusd using:
./verusd -pubkey=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX


[28-Jun-18 07:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> That will cause all blocks mined to use only the address for that public key.


[28-Jun-18 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> Agama should have an option to copy the public key for an address. In the CLI you can do the following:
./verus getaddressesbyaccount ""              - to list your addresses
or
./verus getnewaddres                                      - to get a new address instead
then
./verus validateaddress XXXXXXXXXXXXX         - putting in the address you want the public key for
the result of that command is the public key for that address.

[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> Hello all


[28-Jun-18 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> Pretty new into crypto got somes questions who can help me on that?


[28-Jun-18 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> @Mike1900 Sure, what's up?


[28-Jun-18 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> Hello, just download agama


[28-Jun-18 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> am just running no install, am with ubuntu running on i5 cpu using 4 cores. Just started mining, where the coin go after the mining if i close the app or the pc?


[28-Jun-18 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> like i said am pretty noob about crypto right now don't even know all it's really work yet


[28-Jun-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> don't even know how it's really works


[28-Jun-18 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @englal Any issue with importing PRIV KEYS from one wallet to another that could haunt at a later date?


[28-Jun-18 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> @jimboscott I don't believe so. Do you mean in terms of having the private keys in both wallets?


[28-Jun-18 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I would get rid of the old wallet .dat and archive it


[28-Jun-18 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> @Mike1900  The first time you run either Agama or the CLI it will create a file called wallet.dat. The location of this file differs based on your operating system. On linux this will be in ~/.komodo/VRSC


[28-Jun-18 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> ok let me check üòÉ


[28-Jun-18 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Win 10 here - it's in my appdata/roaming


[28-Jun-18 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> @Mike1900 When you receive or mine coins they will go to addresses that are recorded in the wallet file.


[28-Jun-18 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I have been mining on 7 machines and using the PRIV KEYs to import into one main wallet


[28-Jun-18 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> @jimboscott I think you should be fine. I'm of the mind that it's a good idea to NEVER delete a wallet.dat file unless you're positive it is empty and hasn't made its way onto any other machines, or been mined to using pubkey, etc.


[28-Jun-18 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> If you hang onto that file you know that data will be secure.


[28-Jun-18 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I will back them up, but not have the 'outside' wallets mining to a wallet that I have already exported everything from.


[28-Jun-18 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Gets messy that way.


[28-Jun-18 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> And on import, just make sure the addresses show up, reindex if needed, and I would call their presence in the UI, be it Agama or CLI, sufficient evidence that it is safe to use that wallet and expect those addresses to be used like any others in the wallet.


[28-Jun-18 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> @englal  what can i do with the coins after? importing into somewhere?


[28-Jun-18 08:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> The only difference is the imported transaction shows a different date - but the block dates are all the same.


[28-Jun-18 08:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> sorry everybody am really new into all that


[28-Jun-18 08:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> me too...


[28-Jun-18 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Everything looks right in the wallet - the 'time' just changes to when it was imported

[28-Jun-18 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> @Mike1900 There's nothing you need to do with the coins, you have them, they're yours. Anything you mine right now, and for the next month will be locked for a period ranging from about a month to two years and a month. In that time, the coins are still yours, in your wallet, but can't be spent.


[28-Jun-18 08:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Consolidated some yesterday


[28-Jun-18 08:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> @Mike1900 If you buy coins, are paid for bounties, or otherwise recieve unlocked coins, those will also be in that wallet file and can be transacted with.


[28-Jun-18 08:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> @Mike1900 How familiar are you with cryptocurrencies in general?


[28-Jun-18 08:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> am like at 5%


[28-Jun-18 08:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> have friend who push me on that tonight


[28-Jun-18 08:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> vrsc coin


[28-Jun-18 08:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> am still like i don't really understand all that... i have an another friend also how have a some bitcoin and trade


[28-Jun-18 08:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> trying to introduce myself into all that to do not miss the boat


[28-Jun-18 08:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> Probably the most fundamental thing to know is that what you have in your wallet is not some piece of data that is the coins, it is the cryptographic keys that allow you to spend the coins. The coins are basically a collection of balances on the blockchain - a public ledger. Your wallet allows the software to scan the blockchain and figure out which of those balances are yours, and allows you to create a transaction that spends them, using that key, known as the private key.


[28-Jun-18 08:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> Your wallet.dat file, or any private keys you export from it should be treated like cash. Anyone that ever gets access to them could potentially spend your coins. So the security of the technology is only as secure as you are able to keep that file.


[28-Jun-18 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> SOmeone needs to make a wallet that lets you name your wallet.dat file something like 'catsatplay.jpg'


[28-Jun-18 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> Likewise, if you lose your wallet, either because the hard drive dies, you delete it, it becomes corrupted, etc., the coins are lost to you. They still exist on that ledger, but you no longer have the key that allows you to spend them.


[28-Jun-18 08:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> how do we backup the wallet


[28-Jun-18 08:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> just any place safe like usb key ?


[28-Jun-18 08:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> Excellent question. Shut down the software, whether agama or the CLI. Once it has finished shutting down, you can just copy that wallet.dat file to somewhere safe, and after the copy is complete (it's not typically a large file) you can restart the software.


[28-Jun-18 08:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> ok


[28-Jun-18 08:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> You can also export the wallet in a text format that gives you more direct access to the private keys, etc., which is useful for combining wallets, etc., or as an extra safety measure on a wallet backup.


[28-Jun-18 08:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> like right now am downloading block it's mining right?


[28-Jun-18 08:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> if am not a 100% and i close the soft do i need to start form scratch?


[28-Jun-18 08:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> Always make sure your wallets don't have a chance to sync to any cloud storage or anything like that which could expose them to any third parties. A thumb drive is a great way to back wallets up.


[28-Jun-18 08:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> No, it will pick up where it left off.


[28-Jun-18 08:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> ok


[28-Jun-18 08:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> it the mean time the wallet change during all the process?


[28-Jun-18 08:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> or only at 100%?


[28-Jun-18 08:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> Also remember that new data goes into your wallet file after certain types of activity, such as creating new addresses, after very much mining, etc., so it should be backed up regularly, especially after you receive any large funds, etc.


[28-Jun-18 08:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> ok


[28-Jun-18 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> Right now you're syncing the blockchain, downloading a local copy from peers and scanning it to both verify it's integrity and look for transactions that appear in your wallet. I don't know for sure, but I wouldn't expect it to be writing to the wallet during the sync.


[28-Jun-18 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> And you won't be able to mine until you have finished syncing the chain.


[28-Jun-18 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> gonna use usb then and copy and replace the wallet on it many time as needed


[28-Jun-18 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> You can enable mining, but it won't be able to do anything about it until it is synced up.


[28-Jun-18 08:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> syncing look long how about mining after?


[28-Jun-18 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> Mining is basically like trying to win a lottery that happens every two minutes, and the number of tickets you have is proportional to the amount of computing power you can put into it. Sometimes you'll go days, maybe weeks without getting anything, sometimes you get lucky and get a bunch all at once sometime. It is completely random, but again, in proportion to your hash power.


[28-Jun-18 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> ok


[28-Jun-18 08:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> look like that take a lot of downloaded data?


[28-Jun-18 08:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> I like to think of it as like laying& an egg for a chicken


[28-Jun-18 08:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> You might lay an egg


[28-Jun-18 08:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> You might not


[28-Jun-18 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> ok thanks for the comparison haha... does it worth mining with an i5


[28-Jun-18 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> That's still unknown


[28-Jun-18 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Case in point  - got 10 blocks on 6/27 - got one on 6/28


[28-Jun-18 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> But you have no investment


[28-Jun-18 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> So why not


[28-Jun-18 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> can i broke it ok in general its safe?


[28-Jun-18 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> Mike has concerns he might burn out his cpu


[28-Jun-18 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> @Mike1900 Whether or not it's worth it depends on what you think about the future of the currency.


[28-Jun-18 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> ok


[28-Jun-18 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> i mean does it worth mining with an i5 only


[28-Jun-18 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @Mike1900 get Core Temp to monitor temps


[28-Jun-18 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> let me look into it


[28-Jun-18 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> i5 with 0.3.9 will do about 145 Mh/s


[28-Jun-18 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I got my only block today on my i5


[28-Jun-18 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> ok


[28-Jun-18 08:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> that's 3 cores and 6 threads?


[28-Jun-18 08:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> if i understand an block its the thing you got before mining?


[28-Jun-18 08:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> 4 cores


[28-Jun-18 08:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> then you will do better than 145


[28-Jun-18 08:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i5-3320M CPU @ 2.60GHz √ó 4


[28-Jun-18 08:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> Right - that depends on what you think the coins will be worth in the future. Is the future value you're betting on greater than the cost of the energy and the use of your computer? I'm rather optimistic, so I'm mining with everything I have, including an old 4 core laptop.


[28-Jun-18 08:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> mine is a 6 thread Coffee lake


[28-Jun-18 08:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> got the pc in gift then ... but stay the only pc i use at home under unbuntu


[28-Jun-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763

[28-Jun-18 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> if i install agama on an another computer gonna got a new wallet right?, is there any way to join them ? i think you talked about that just before i join?


[28-Jun-18 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @Mike1900 two wallets is manageable.  I have 7...


[28-Jun-18 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> There are two particularly safe approaches -
you can mine with both wallets, then merge them later
or you can have one wallet on one computer, and have the other computer(s) mine to an address in the one wallet


[28-Jun-18 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> ok


[28-Jun-18 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I have been importing the PRIV KEYS into my main wallet.   One at a time...


[28-Jun-18 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> ok


[28-Jun-18 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> @jimboscott Sounds like that aught to be time for some shell scripting


[28-Jun-18 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> gonna look into that later will starting understand block chain and mining first still not clear into my head


[28-Jun-18 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> It's not that big a task.   Especially with hte 600 GH/s net hash


[28-Jun-18 09:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Think of the blockchain as a huge serialized set of bank safe deposit boxes.   Your PRIV KEY is needed for each box (address) that you own.  The address is the PUBLIC key, but the only way to get what's in the boxes is with both the public and the private keys.  The wallet  is your set of keys.


[28-Jun-18 09:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Anyone can search using your public key and see a transaction.   But only someone with the private key can move the contents.


[28-Jun-18 09:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> does peoples can steal my wallet? except by taking my file?


[28-Jun-18 09:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> i mean what's is inside


[28-Jun-18 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> No.  They need your wallet data.  They can hack you or steal your laptop.... but they need the wallet.dat file.   If they get that then it is theirs.


[28-Jun-18 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Just like if someone stole my keychain.


[28-Jun-18 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Of course, the bank will ID me and check my signature.... but same idea


[28-Jun-18 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> ok


[28-Jun-18 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike1900> my SSd is encrypted at the boot gonna be hard to hack that if someone stole my laptop loll

[dscrdvrsc] <mk111> does that mean i have found two blocks?


[29-Jun-18 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mk111> and that i will get 384 VRSC?


[29-Jun-18 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CHMEX> Yes lucky you


[29-Jun-18 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CHMEX> if you move the direction tab you should see when the coins unlock


[29-Jun-18 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mk111> i dont see where it mentions when the coins will unlock


[29-Jun-18 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mk111> once unlocked the coins will show in the "Transparent Balance" section?


[29-Jun-18 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CHMEX> Move the part in Black to the right and in the red part you will see a height (block number) when your coins become spendable. I'm not sure how the coins end up in your address I guess you will have to send them from agama as they are now in a locked address (p2sh)

[29-Jun-18 05:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <capo100> might want to check trading for price.. it may be to early to get an accurate number, until it hits an exchange.


[29-Jun-18 05:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <patcrypto> do we know total supply ?  and how come no one is talking about this coin except for crypto ritch ?   s this a really new coin ?


[29-Jun-18 05:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <capo100> not sure of the total supply.  but the white paper looks really good.

[29-Jun-18 05:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <benohanlon> FYI @everyone I am suggesting something for Komodo that you may want to have a say on because it could benefit. It's an idea for a 'brief and micro-bounties' community that would create a decentralized resource for our content, comms and marketing and bring it into line with Komodo's ecosystem. I've recorded a video of myself explaining it (not official KMD video just me talking!).

If you're interested please come and share your thoughts here and leave comments https://forum.komodoplatform.com/t/about-the-komodo-influencer-network-category/117. 

If this gains enough traction and you like the idea I can take this to Steve and JL777 and suggest we try it out. Please make your voice heard! 

P.S. if you just want the video it's here https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=O1LdWU1WEQo.

[29-Jun-18 08:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @capo100 You can increase this number to the maximum number of threads your CPU is capable of running.   Any more is pointless and could even be counterproductive

[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Why did you say your laptop has 2 cores?


[29-Jun-18 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Most modern Intel CPU's have two threads per core.


[29-Jun-18 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> So AMD might be this way also - not sure.  But try 5 threads for sure.

[29-Jun-18 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <aelder> Try 2 at the max.


[29-Jun-18 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Just curious - would trying too many potentially cause problems?


[29-Jun-18 08:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <aelder> Nothing that rebooting wouldn't fix I don't think.


[29-Jun-18 08:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <aelder> system might become unresponsive.


[29-Jun-18 08:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> That's what I was sort of thinking too.


[29-Jun-18 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Unless the wallet detects the max number and ignores any input over that.

[dscrdvrsc] <TexWiller> I've added infos about circulating supply. The "actual circulating supply" dashboard will (or, better, should üòÉ ) update every time a timelocked block opens. Basically, sums "mined/minted non timelocked" + "timelock expired". The query behind is rather complex and may have wrong values; I'll keep it monitored but let me know if you find any bug. As usual, here --> http://35.231.87.124/

[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Not sure where this should go exactly, but the faq for setting up staking seems to make no sense at all for those with the GUI wallet (the commands listed return as errors).   How does one manage their coins for staking using only the CLI commands available in the 0.3.9 CLI command set?


[30-Jun-18 09:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> @jimboscott you mean staking but not mining? I believe you are always staking when mining. In the GUI if you set the number of threads to 0, you are staking. Have you tried that with the CLI?


[30-Jun-18 09:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> If you are already mining with one process you can try this 
./verus setgenerate true 0


[30-Jun-18 09:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> Or when starting  try 
./verusd -gen -genproclimit=0


[30-Jun-18 10:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I know that's what it says, other sources state the coins must go to a Z address first, then come back to a public address before they will stake.   That is what I am wanting solid guidance on.


[30-Jun-18 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> That‚Äòs true for mined or minted coins


[30-Jun-18 11:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> Here's what I wrote in #faq-draft about time locked coins & staking:
The Zcash protocol requires you to send all coins received by mining or staking (reward transactions) once unlocked to a private address and then to a public/transparent address before you can use them either for staking or for making transactions (that‚Äôs how you make use of your rewarded coins = coinbase coins). So, once your coins loose their time lock, in the GUI first generate a private address and then go to the ‚ÄûSend‚Äú screen and use ‚ÄûShield a coinbase transaction‚Äú (will take some time, likely 5 min, but may be up to 20 min, much longer than from a public/transparent address to another). Finally you transfer the coins from your private address back to (one of) your public / transparent address(es) and you‚Äôll automatically start staking.


[30-Jun-18 11:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <penguin> Is there an issue with my wallet, if a transaction of a found block (192) displays a destination address which is not mine? (GUI wallet)


[30-Jun-18 01:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
b address ?


[30-Jun-18 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @penguin Go to Agama's settings, select wallet.dat keys menu, pick VRSC, click get keys. Check if there is a key that you have mined into and I am pretty sure it is there. That means you are mining to your wallet.


[30-Jun-18 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @penguin in the GUI, all mined blocks go to a new unique address in your wallet. There is a way to make them all go one place (-pubkey) via CLI, and that will be added to the GUI in the future

[dscrdvrsc] <bigmopap> I started mining using my labtop back in June 17 and have 384 at immature status. how long before it gets to be matured


[01-Jul-18 04:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigmopap> and how long before you start to get new rewards . i get 45 mhs


[01-Jul-18 05:40 AM] hyperDEX#6586
0.0045/500*1440*192


[01-Jul-18 05:42 AM] hyperDEX#6586
0.045/500 * 1440 that is how many blocks a day roughly (network hash at 500)


[01-Jul-18 05:42 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But the luck plays a part


[01-Jul-18 07:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> @bigmopap you could calculate it like this (but remember this is just a statistical probability): you have 45MH/s. The network is at 380 GH (varies). There are roughly 1440 block rewards, in theory 50% for mining and 50% for staking. Thus 720 minable block rewards per day. With your power 45/380000*720 = 0.085 blocks per day. Or 11.7 days for one block. I guess network hash will increase soon.

[dscrdvrsc] <superbergs> @jimboscott thanks mate i appreciate the help!


[01-Jul-18 02:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
just in case, I noticed that it seems that dynamically changing the genproclimit via setgenerate true XX end up in going very slow if the point is to go up : an example : I start with genproclimit=1, 20MH, then go to genproclimit=20 : move very slow to 40 MH.
When I just stop it and restart directly with a genproclimit=20 : I go directly to 240 MH


[01-Jul-18 02:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
and it keeps stabilized at that hashps


[01-Jul-18 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> <dwy> that is because it does a simple average with how long the current node has been up. If you sync without mining (which is recommended), then turn mining on, the hashrate slowly climbs to what you expect. But if you stop and restart, you will stabilize on the correct hashrate very quickly.

[02-Jul-18 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <n3rfed> That Colin Andrews interview sent me on the path to mine Verus , and I am here with a question about thread counts and expected  mh rate.


[02-Jul-18 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <n3rfed> If my processor is an amd ryzen 5 1400 quad core ( 8 cpus) 3.7 ghz, should I be running my thread count at 2 or 4 ?


[02-Jul-18 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <n3rfed> And, if my MH rate is  37.9 /s   @ 2 threads, is that good or should I be seeking more


[02-Jul-18 08:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <n3rfed> Nevermind, I take back my question and will refer to the cpu hashrate guide


[02-Jul-18 08:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <n3rfed> Thanks for your patience, no assistance is required ;p


[02-Jul-18 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @n3rfed Run every thread you can - that would be 8.  My son mines this on a Ryzen 5 and he is getting around 170 I think.   I am hashing about 1.3 Gh/s here and I get 2-4 blocks per day.  One Ryzen 5 is probably going to find a block every 4 days or so, but luck might be such that you get two in a day... or none in two weeks.


[02-Jul-18 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763

[02-Jul-18 11:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it would also help to know where the message you are seeing comes from. for example, is it from the command line or debug.log?


[03-Jul-18 05:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @n3rfed I would just monitor it to see where it gets up to.   Obviously you do not want to truly overheat, but I tend to think that people get worried about overheating well before overheating actually happens.  I mean, there are thousands of posts about people freaking out that their GPU's are running 70c.

[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I have mining rigs (3), a laptop, desktops (3) and a 'skeleton' AMD Ryzen sitting out in 'breadboard' fashion.   There are 3 newer i7's doing about 200 each.  An i7 laptop at 120.  An i3 doing 70.  An i5 pulling 150 and the Ryzen is doing 420.  My old desktop has two cores from an older i7 running a paltry 30.  Total is closer to 1.4 Gh actually.

[03-Jul-18 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <oscar> why can't see the unconfirmed balance here?


[03-Jul-18 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Some Agama wallet functions are not 100%.  Example... never try to import multiple private keys.  It screws those keys up...  will need to restore wallet from backup and import one at a time...


[03-Jul-18 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> Oh no. I imported multiple keys.


[03-Jul-18 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <oscar> my recieve got 2 pub and 1 private adress


[03-Jul-18 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> I actually imported the original keys and have the same keys on many machines. Bad idea?


[03-Jul-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Should be fine but doing more than one key at a time with the GUI wallet messes things up.


[03-Jul-18 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> I did two at once. The thought was that the balance would be the same across all machines using the same keys. Followed the Komodo instructions.


[03-Jul-18 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <oscar> actrualy I don't know how many coins I have mined,Immature Balance shows nothing


[03-Jul-18 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> The other big issue is I cannot figure out how to start over and delete keys.


[03-Jul-18 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> If I import the same keys one by one will it properly overwrite the existing ones.


[03-Jul-18 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> I'm having a rough night.. 
First a new i7 7700 build is only hashing at 50Mh.. as I was discussion in the #mining  channel.  Still teching that..
Now I lost power on another machine and  its gotten all sorts of screwed up. I think windows did an automatic rollback or something.. or windows items are corrupt. Taskbar is not working properly and added icons are gone, and the Agama wallet wont open

[03-Jul-18 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> I'm thinking about just reinstalling windows. 
I have the whole Komodo folder backed up from Apps Data. Is that all I need?


[03-Jul-18 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> Maybe these issues/fixes can make it to some sort of pinned comment or doc.


[03-Jul-18 08:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> Currently have two machines not mining due to GUI wallet issues.


[03-Jul-18 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> can someone confirm that I can reinstall Agama on a new build and just replace.... the wallet.dat? or the whole Komodo folder? or?????


[03-Jul-18 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I have done that.  Extract and run to create the folders but shut it down before it takes forever to sync.  I keep separate wallet.dat files but you can avoid the sync time by moving block data from a synced install.


[03-Jul-18 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> And I have moved a wallet from one box to another.


[03-Jul-18 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> @jimboscott am I just replacing the wallet.da =t or the whole folder on the new install?


[03-Jul-18 08:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> If you replace the whole folder then you will not have to sync from the start...  that is really the value as I see it.  Nobody is going to be getting so many rewards that they cannot import them one at a time by hand.  I am running 1.4 Gh here and move about 2-5 per day.


[03-Jul-18 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I would let each machine have its own wallet.


[03-Jul-18 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> But import to a central wallet on a known schedule.


[03-Jul-18 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> ONE privkey at a time.   Trying to use the 'import multiple private keys' on .0.3.8 or .0.3.9 does NOT work and it actually makes importing that particular private key impossible.   I had to restore my wallet today before I could import them one at a time.   The wallet THINKS the multiple priv keys were imported and when you fail to see the transactions, importing them one at a time does not work either.   Just don't try it.


[03-Jul-18 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> @jimboscott  Can I expect to do 1-3/day at 1GH?


[03-Jul-18 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I would think so.  Here is my last few days - but the nethash was around 400-500

[03-Jul-18 09:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Some on the 29th were imported from other machines from the 26-28


[03-Jul-18 09:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> at current network hash, 1Gh would get 2.6 blocks a day


[03-Jul-18 09:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> if luck was 100% perfect and on schedule


[03-Jul-18 09:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> but luck is all over on a short term basis


[03-Jul-18 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I actually think the answer is 1.3.   I am not positive, but rewards go to stakers at a 50/50 split


[03-Jul-18 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> But I am not exactly sure how that economy is worked out.


[03-Jul-18 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> miners get 192


[03-Jul-18 09:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Right... but from where do stakers get theirs?  A separate block or another 192 from one block?


[03-Jul-18 09:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Personally, what I have been getting seems to bear out your numbers.


[03-Jul-18 09:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> separate 192


[03-Jul-18 09:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> for pos..


[03-Jul-18 09:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> So, half of the blocks go to stakers, leaving miners with 720 blocks per day... right?


[03-Jul-18 09:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> no


[03-Jul-18 09:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> you mine a block.. its showing your rewards 192


[03-Jul-18 09:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> Is there value in only staking?


[03-Jul-18 09:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> thats what you will get upon maturiy


[03-Jul-18 09:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> yes


[03-Jul-18 09:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @bigtom YES


[03-Jul-18 09:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> but staking is hard ATM.. only 468k coins are unlocked


[03-Jul-18 09:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> But coins have to be unlocked.  I have NONE.


[03-Jul-18 09:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> staking is actually SUPER EASY for those with unlocked coins.  It will never be easier.


[03-Jul-18 09:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> when rewards cut to 96 staking will happen on those coins..  And it will be more accessable to all


[03-Jul-18 09:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> As time goes on, staking difficulty rises with more and more unlocked coins.


[03-Jul-18 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> Never thought about only staking. Many lower powered machines that only stake.


[03-Jul-18 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> If you have a one core CPU that runs slow as molasses - you can stake.


[03-Jul-18 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I mined 32,000 TZC last Fall.  Have been staking them since - 42,000 now.


[03-Jul-18 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> So I have one pair of shared addresses imported on every machine. Any idea how that will work? Should I try to convert everything to separate addresses?


[03-Jul-18 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Staked rewards are a constant - just like mined rewards.   When just a few people have staked coins they share 50% of the daily minting of coins.


[03-Jul-18 09:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @bigtom Before you get rewards, I would delete the wallet.dat files and let Agama create separate and unique ones for your installs.   That's just me.


[03-Jul-18 09:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> This was possible by importing the private addresses before the initial sync finished.


[03-Jul-18 09:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> I tried deleting the wallet.dat. I do not remember if that worked. I will do it though on your recommend.


[03-Jul-18 09:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> especially since I imported them using the multiple feature.


[03-Jul-18 09:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Oh... you can import priv keys all day long.  But there is a store of 'empty' addresses that the wallet creates and if you duplicate the wallet then you will have non-unique addresses.  That could lead to some confusion when you run out of them from what i read here.


[03-Jul-18 09:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> You imported with the multiple import?


[03-Jul-18 09:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Do NOT do that.  If you had transactions on those addresses they will not really import.


[03-Jul-18 09:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> You only lock those out and cannot use them again.


[03-Jul-18 09:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> Some of the wallets have an additional address.


[03-Jul-18 09:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> I will have to transfer my rewards to you and then get them back.üòÄ


[03-Jul-18 09:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I would only import actual priv keys from rewards transactions and.... PLEASE just do them one at a time.  TRUST ME!


[03-Jul-18 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> If you try to import a reward transaction and it fails to produce the transaction then you will need to go back to a backup of the wallet before you tried the multiple import.


[03-Jul-18 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> So far as I know I have no rewards yet. I have to check everything and delete the dat files, right? Thats it.


[03-Jul-18 09:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I would do that.  no rewards - nothing to lose.  Then each box has its own set of keys.  But you can move the blocks by hand until a better way is implemented.


[03-Jul-18 09:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> Do I need a private address?


[03-Jul-18 09:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I am not an expert on this, but have been messing with this for about 3 weeks and have had some experience with it.


[03-Jul-18 09:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> Private Z address


[03-Jul-18 09:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @bigtom Agama will create all addresses automatically.  Each reward will have its OWN address that is assigned when rewarded.


[03-Jul-18 09:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> But the reward address is tied to the wallet address.


[03-Jul-18 09:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> You will need to download the Z Cash proving keys or something like that.


[03-Jul-18 09:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> The reward addresses are all different.  there is a way with the CLI wallet to set it to a single address, but this is not like mining RVN or ETH or MDEX or whatever.  It is a bit different.


[03-Jul-18 09:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> The wallet will tell you that the Z cash keys have to be downloaded.  Takes a few minutes.


[03-Jul-18 09:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> And, to further complicate things, when you look at the block explorer... you will see a DIFFERENT address to where the rewards were sent...  it is strange.

[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> SAME transaction....


[03-Jul-18 09:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> So the addresses are in the wallet.dat. Deleteing that will clear them out so I can get new ones.


[03-Jul-18 09:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Yes. All of your keys are in the wallet.dat.  If there are no rewards then you are losing nothing.  The wallet.dat is the only file that has the value in it... when you have coins.


[03-Jul-18 09:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> All keys are in it - private and public


[03-Jul-18 09:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> The math is amazing.  For IOTA, I think there are more private keys than there are atoms in the known Universe...


[03-Jul-18 09:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> WAY more in fact.


[03-Jul-18 09:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> The Z cash proving keys must be somewhere else. I did not have to download them again.


[03-Jul-18 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Maybe in your Komodo folder?


[03-Jul-18 09:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> deleted the file and the previous addresses were gone and got a new single address assigned.


[03-Jul-18 09:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> I just need the one address in the receive area, right?


[03-Jul-18 09:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> No.  That address might or might not be used.  The addresses are assigned automatically from a pool that your Agama wallet created when you made a new wallet.  If you create a 'receive' address that is needed when you want me to send you coins, but this is NOT going to be your mining address.


[03-Jul-18 09:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> You CAN make it that way with the CLI wallet, but the GUI version creates addresses on the fly and they are all unique.


[03-Jul-18 09:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Just let the wallet do its thing.  The only thing to remember is this - when you import a Private Key - ONE at a time.  If you have multiple ones to import, import them as singles but on the LAST one set the switch for a wallet rescan so they all show up.


[03-Jul-18 09:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> Ahh . Now I get it.


[03-Jul-18 09:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> All of these are different and I did not choose any of them...

[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> I have been importing the receiving addresses to to all the machines.


[03-Jul-18 09:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> That actually could cause a problem.


[03-Jul-18 09:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Unless you did them one at a time..


[03-Jul-18 09:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> So the mining address in not visible int he GUI.


[03-Jul-18 09:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> The mining address is what it is when you get a reward.  You do not know what it is going to be.


[03-Jul-18 09:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> And you cannot choose it.


[03-Jul-18 09:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> Ok . So far no rewards and I am deleting al the wallet.dat files. This is causing a new file to be generated.


[03-Jul-18 09:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Here is what I think happens when you try a 'import multiple priv keys' with the GUI wallet.  The wallet sees the keys and registers then as imported, but the transaction is not incorporated into the wallet FULLY and it does not show up.  However, the wallet THINKS that priv key has been imported so when you try to import it again as a SINGLE priv key... it just sort of says (I think) "Hey... we already did this - go away" and you cannot get that transaction into your wallet.


[03-Jul-18 09:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> You will get new wallet.dat files when you run the wallet again.   Double check to make sure but I am certain this happens.


[03-Jul-18 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Once you get a reward... never delete again.  You can move, archive, rename... but never delete again unless there is a clear and expert reason to do so.


[03-Jul-18 09:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> Thanks!


[03-Jul-18 09:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Again... I am not an expert.  I am an old fart a few years from retirement who has a hobby that might help him through the golden years of life.

[03-Jul-18 09:48 PM] Gateway#3763

[03-Jul-18 09:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <oscar> need I open the wallet so many days?


[03-Jul-18 09:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> The process does not depend upon the wallet being open.  The transaction is programmed to mature on the blockchain.  You could shut the wallet down for 5 years and come back in 2023 and the coins will be yours and available.


[03-Jul-18 09:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <oscar> ok


[03-Jul-18 09:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <oscar> wow,seems the bestthing is mining from now


[03-Jul-18 09:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> But, when you DO have coins unlocked, you will want to keep the wallet open so you can STAKE them.  You will get rewards from staking them too.

[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> fyi to solve my current problem, I reinstalled windows and kept my personal files in place. Then the wallet and everything started working. Its crazy though that a power loos while mining with Agama wallet caused a windows corruption. Perhaps coincidence , but I've been building computers for 20+ years adnd thisis the first time such a corruption happened.

[04-Jul-18 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> It's not for everybody, but I turn the directory containing wallet.dat into a git repo, and occasionally do a `git commit` of wallet.dat. This allows you to "roll back" to a previous version of wallet.dat, if it gets corrupted or whatever, pretty easily. I have used this also when I accidentally mined my own fork of VRSC and I thought it messed up my wallet. You can backup this directory/git repo like any other files

[05-Jul-18 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I might have been saying that I never deleted my wallet.dat files no matter what.  If I have a wallet.dat file for any coin that needs to be 'reset' I just rename the existing one wallet.180705 (if I renamed it today).  That way I have everything somewhere - and my crypto stuff is also backed up constantly.

[dscrdvrsc] <elvinsophus> Has anyone tested the script in FAQ3 in #faq-chosen channel? I think it calculates the days to maturity incorrectly by unnecessarily subtracting current block height from blockstomaturity. I'm on a Windows machine and cannot test it myself at the moment.


[06-Jul-18 01:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> @elvinsophus The calculation is obviously wrong. I mentioned this in another channel when @TexWiller posted the same thing as a response, but I had no idea it was in the FAQ. Subtracting the current block creates a bad solve when blockstomaturity<=current block. There is also an assumption that the blocks/day is always exactly 1440, which is not true and therefore the dates are not "exact". They are "estimated".@crypto05  This needs to be updated.

[07-Jul-18 12:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> but you don't need a connection to that node to be on the network

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> that is just one p2p node

[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> @patcrypto Each block is randomly time released for maturity. I believe the max is about 2 years. I have some that are a few months to a year until mature. When the next halving in the reward goes into effect (96 VRSC/block), there will no longer be a wait time on those. The maturity is only for the early 384 and 192 reward blocks.


[07-Jul-18 01:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <patcrypto> Thanks ... I have 3 of the 192 blocks and it seems they are now harder to mine as more people must be mining.   that's a hell of a long wait though


[07-Jul-18 01:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> @patcrypto When you look at your reward blocks in wallet you will see a a blockstomaturity number. if you divide that number by 1440 you will get the approximate number of days when it will be unlocked.


[07-Jul-18 02:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> #general-discussion  Why is everyone mining VRSC? Plenty of new crypto currencies out there. 
I like VRSC because of the general vision and the people behind it are notable individuals with real world experience. The decentralization effort is of very unique interest. If there was a coin that seems to be on par with security and practice like the current mainstream coins, it is VRSC.

It is not just a coin. It is a great move for blockchain transactions in general.

[dscrdvrsc] <original_username> @bigtom 

I am mining for the idealism first and foremost. I like the vision paper a lot, even if it is a bit cheesy at times (reminds me of the first few episodes of Silicon Valley). I do like cheesy though really ;)

Secondly I am mining for the tech, there is a great blend of some of the strongest pieces of crypto development so far here. The clincher was the CPU mining, which makes mining accessible and realistic for those of us who don't want to buy a ton/have a ton of GPUs ready to go. I had one PC, then I bought a Ryzen 2700 just to mine this coin. CPU mining plus POS also makes mining more democratic, and probably less resource intensive, and with the algo developments from 0.3.8 onwards, should allow for relatively sustainable decentralisation. 

Other points are that the vision paper not only has ideas for "making the world a better place" through decentralised voting system and free/open information sharing etc, it also has ideas to gain mass appeal - such as phone apps for voting on your favourite pets. Make that accessible enough and mass appeal is a real possibility. 

Lasty but importantly, after I did a little reading through Mike's CV. I have to say I couldn't be happier that such a great project is being led by such an accomplished individual and supported by his network. The progressive work done with the CPU algo just goes to show what is possible.


[07-Jul-18 04:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> At least were getting blocks üòâüòé


[07-Jul-18 04:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <original_username> I think it's important that one merges idealism with realism and practical skills and experience of what is possible, which it seems we have here


[07-Jul-18 05:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Im also liking the fact that we can only use cpu‚Äôs, mine is an old amd A10, its warming up alot but its stable and has found a block , i carnt help but ponder though how long we will have left , people are clever and determined, i wonder ,if there was a way to optimise a cpu to hash alot faster when will someone find a way to make gpu‚Äôs hash faster, maybe they will or maybe they wontüòÅ, either way i can see myself following this community of verus for a long time to come


[07-Jul-18 05:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <original_username> @stretcher83 check out crypto rich's interview with Mike. GPUs may be competitive, asics may be a possibility, but with the theoretical limits of what CPUs are capable of being pushed with this algo, CPU mining should in theory remain feasible for some time. In practice we will just have to see what happens


[07-Jul-18 05:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <original_username> it's on youtube somewhere, you can google it üòâ


[07-Jul-18 05:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> Considering what happened to get the CPU speed up, I think GPU might be a little faster but not by much. Although multiple GPUs scale better than a bunch of CPUs. I tired running 2x 36 core nodes as a single 72 core machine and the wallet ignored the second nodes CPUs.


[07-Jul-18 05:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> @original_username  yeh thanks for the heads up, i watched the vid a while ago and i was glued to the screen, a bit of it went over my head but yeh i got the jist of it, i understand nobody has made a gpu miner for verus coin yet, and when they do it probably wont be as fast as some cpu‚Äôs , because the verus team have optimised the algo for cpu‚Äôs , but i wonder when or if the verus algo can be optimised for gpu‚Äôs aswell, i mean the verus cpu speed was very slow before the recent update i believe, 0.017 mh/s i was reading, and now after the 3.9 update im getting 29mh/s, a big jump up, do you think someone will come up with an optimisation for gpu mining, i would hope not but i know how clever people are and how fast the crypto scene moves


[07-Jul-18 05:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I dont just mean a gpu miner i mean an optimised algo gor gpu‚Äôs

[07-Jul-18 06:17 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <englal> @miketout @bigtom I was just recently looking at software for node discovery to take a tally of the network.

[dscrdvrsc] <Sosky> has anyone any idea aproximetly when the solo mining phase will end and when will we get some pools? I didn't get any blocks since the halving üò¶


[07-Jul-18 11:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> There were some conversations on here a couple days ago about how pools might be set up while new blocks are so time locked, not sure if that will happen before the time locks end out not. In any case the time locks will be off after the next having, I believe in about 2-3 weeks. I'm not at my computer, so harder to check at the moment. Once the that happens pools will be much safer and more straightforward, and we expect to see multiple pools pop up. We also intend to have an official pool sorry after that.


[07-Jul-18 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> Roughly July 28th is when 192 blocks end and we halve to 96


[07-Jul-18 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> is that using 1440/day or what appears to be the slightly lower yield of just over 1400?


[07-Jul-18 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> it was a recent estimate, and since it's only a few weeks in the future, so it doesn't have as much error as trying to predict maturity dates 2 years out


[07-Jul-18 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> in less than a day, we switch to the correct 50/50 POS, which I belive will give us 1440/day as well (block 67680)


[07-Jul-18 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @miketout what has the ratio been for POW/POS?


[07-Jul-18 08:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> @jimboscott I believe it has averaged approximately 55/45

[08-Jul-18 01:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> @miketout to confirm something thats been a little confusing and not clear on the blockchain explorer. ... is it 1440/day to POS and 1440/day to POW?
each mined block is getting 192.. not shared.... but I'm not seeing an equlivant POS share for that block
are the POS shares clumped into block payouts?

[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> the exchange


[08-Jul-18 03:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Gmoney 50% of blocks go to POS, but the hash rate for POW can still be calculated with 1440 due to the way the difficulty algorithms work


[08-Jul-18 03:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> @miketout  ok thanks. yes that the main thing that I needed to know. My hash formula is using 1440


[08-Jul-18 03:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> @miketout do you have any thoughts on that since the hash spike to 850 on the 4th (i think it was) there has been an incresing numner of poeple saying that they have found no blocks for several days, or luck has been off dramatically? Will anything with the switch at block 67680 go to fix any distribution issues? Do you have any toughts on this?


[08-Jul-18 03:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> Personally, I have .5% of the hash and for sure luck has been off since then. A bunch of junk machines I have have been picking up the slack for all the big machines, so it hasnt been a total loss, but I'm off a few blocks a day for sure for sure, even thogh hashrate has long since stabalized.


[08-Jul-18 03:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> There were two spikes . Earlier one was to 870ish on the 4th.


[08-Jul-18 03:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> I'm a believer in randomally random random so all this could just be a part of the cosmos, but I have a sence that there is slight gaming of the system.


[08-Jul-18 03:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i'm not aware of a gaming of the system, but if there is one, i would like to know


[08-Jul-18 03:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> I had little since the 4th but picked up 3 in the last 24 hours. Also have close to .3-.5%.


[08-Jul-18 03:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> 3-4 for you should be normal
so the void of the last few days is abnormal


[08-Jul-18 03:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> which has been common


[08-Jul-18 03:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> anyways. clearly I dont have the awnsers.. haha.. I'm just sharing my feeling as someone who has been keeping my own stats,


[08-Jul-18 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> I am pulling as much data as I can to analyze it. I am not seeing anything too odd that lasts for too long.


[08-Jul-18 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> @miketout .. does the ping time to your connected miner nodes affect your ability to deliver hash?


[08-Jul-18 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> if someone spikes in a big way on hash rate, they could theoretically take a few more blocks and then drop off completely and let others take less as the difficulty adjusts. with the POS, they should be thwarted from really messing with the chain too much, and even with a big spike, the POS should prevent them from getting over 51%. since we've been low on POS, there's been an opening for more than 51%, but that is closing in a little over an hour


[08-Jul-18 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> and to get that, someone would have needed a huge hash spike


[08-Jul-18 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> that we haven't seen


[08-Jul-18 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> and regarding ping time.. Is it possible to blacklist slow server and whitelist fast servers to end up with any competitive advantage?


[08-Jul-18 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> the calculated diff takes a long time to adjust down after a big hashrate spike comes in and goes away. the PoS blocks solve the high diff to slow down the diff from dropping


[08-Jul-18 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> It is certainly possible to grab maybe 10% of the nethash, but it would be a big costly undertaking. Getting 50%+ would take a team of people and a few thousand $.


[08-Jul-18 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> ping time doesn't affect your ability to deliver hash, but you could certainly waste time hashing on stale chain tips or not get your blocks submitted without long delays and have them orphaned


[08-Jul-18 03:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> also the hashrate spike doesnt immediately reflect in higher diff, but I have seen a dramatic drop in my PoW blocks found, which then is followed by a hashrate increase. this is just a delay in the block time diff adjusting and on the way up, likely the PoS mechanism is also dampening the change


[08-Jul-18 03:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> That is one question I had about how the algo decides the winner. Is the first to report back or the one with a solve and the lowest timestamp.


[08-Jul-18 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Gmoney we are considering ways to improve the p2p network, and QoS is an important factor.
@jl777c VerusPoS should exactly follow PoW, not dampening, nor destabilizing PoW response on difficulty, but interfering with any attempt to mess with time stamps or get more than 51%


[08-Jul-18 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> Network could be an issue.


[08-Jul-18 03:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> PoW diff adjustment to real hashrate and solve times just has some latency


[08-Jul-18 03:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> yes


[08-Jul-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> and with PoS getting half the blocks, it seems it will slow down things by 50%


[08-Jul-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> how many blocks does the diff algo take into account?


[08-Jul-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Gmoney with PoS, it's a little complicated


[08-Jul-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> i dont think it is a bad thing, it is just what it is and has a longer latency that pure PoW


[08-Jul-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> in one sense, 45, in another many more


[08-Jul-18 03:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> yes within 100 blocks it is adjusting pretty well


[08-Jul-18 03:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i don't think PoS will slow response


[08-Jul-18 03:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it's just a different algo than the normal Digishield in Zcash


[08-Jul-18 03:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> PoS can affect adjustment, but equally all the time, regardless of hashrate changes


[08-Jul-18 03:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> so, in one sense, you could say that it does


[08-Jul-18 03:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> well I have experienced cases where the real hashrate is drastically lower than the diff, and PoS blocks are coming in ave 60 seconds, but if pure PoW they wouldnt have. if PoS is assuming the hashrate is the diff and the hashrate is lower than diff, it slows down


[08-Jul-18 03:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> k.. ya that generally lets me know.. 100 isnt that great.. a hash spike is out within 2 hours then (or less) so shouldnt be an issue why it coinsided with days of lower POW blocks for many..


[08-Jul-18 03:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> but it does when the hashrate is stable or when climbing or dropping


[08-Jul-18 03:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> 45


[08-Jul-18 03:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> for PoW, it uses 45 for averaging, but the PoS relative difficulty can go much longer and is often 90. PoW should respond in 45


[08-Jul-18 03:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> but PoS randomizes its response a little


[08-Jul-18 03:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> always


[08-Jul-18 03:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> but with big spikes, it may take 100


[08-Jul-18 03:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> to stabilize, but this is pretty common


[08-Jul-18 03:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> still low.. 120 for most equihash coins.. 720 for monero..etc


[08-Jul-18 03:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> and would be like that without the PoS as well


[08-Jul-18 03:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> yes, it seems responsive enough


[08-Jul-18 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Steve666> Is there anyway to see how many coins are being staked? That could explain the spikes somewhat if someone is not staking 24/7 and has lots of coins


[08-Jul-18 03:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> staking won't change that way. it is completely relative to PoW at every block


[08-Jul-18 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i don't know of a way to see either, because the only time you see is when someone submits a PoS block


[08-Jul-18 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> Ok anyways @miketout  I think its worthwile to look into the ability to deliver equal distribution across the P2P network. Perhaps studing ip addresses.... Although that would only be useful if it could be correlated with hashrates to see if anyone really is getting a network competitive advantage.


[08-Jul-18 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Steve666> I thought staking is 50% of the hash rate, thus if someone were to stake more for a short period wouldnt the hash rate adjust?

[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> I would suspect network latency as an issue. Everything else seems solid. Even 100ms can be big.


[08-Jul-18 03:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> staking difficulty is completely relative to PoW and could make a short term change, but should be quickly adjusted for. i guess if someone took huge amounts off completely and back on, but it uses an exponentially adjusted, linear weighted moving average to take into account bursts and adjust more quickly


[08-Jul-18 04:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i would also suspect network latency may be an issue, as there are definite ways it could have an impact. i think if it is the issue, it could be solved with a way to discover and further decentralize trustworthy nodes, which I've been thinking of, as well as eigentrust++ types of approach with QoS


[08-Jul-18 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> but @Steve666 you could also have a point with big changes in staking supply


[08-Jul-18 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i can't rule it out without more study, i should say


[08-Jul-18 04:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Steve666> That is the only thing that would make sense to me, because it has always declined after a while.


[08-Jul-18 04:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> Are node connections random or calculated?


[08-Jul-18 04:02 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> in other news.. I guess I should shut up because I just found 3 of the last 110 blocks..  haha


[08-Jul-18 04:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> Thanks for your time @miketout ... Really appreciated


[08-Jul-18 04:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> i think people are just used to mining on pools with steady payout per hour


[08-Jul-18 04:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> solo mining just doesnt work that way. never has, never will


[08-Jul-18 04:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> Ya @jl777c ... I mean yes .. but no..


[08-Jul-18 04:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> no matter how much you want it to be a smooth return


[08-Jul-18 04:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> things seem to be coming back to normal in the last 24 hours

[08-Jul-18 04:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> i think people are obsessing over when they are not finding blocks, ignoring the times when they are finding more than expected


[08-Jul-18 04:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> randomly random random..


[08-Jul-18 04:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> if you only notice when there is a shortage, it will seem something is against you


[08-Jul-18 04:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> and I notice you need to get many many blocks before it all averages out


[08-Jul-18 04:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> since we see the hashing mechanism and if our node is hashing, then it is just luck


[08-Jul-18 04:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> I feel I'm pretty even about it..  understanding the highs and lows..  I'm standing by my concern . If it was gamed for a few days, it could happen again..  Or maybe it's just how the oscillations go..


[08-Jul-18 04:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> oscillation in difficulty is understandable. big oscillation in hashrate is different.


[08-Jul-18 04:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> well.. hashrate and diff are directly correlated.. I'm talking osculation in reward distribution..

[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> Ok suns up, time for me to sleep aswell

[08-Jul-18 04:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <original_username> could it just be people renting hashrate on AWS spot for example? They pile on a load of instances when they are available, and then when the spot capacity is required elsewhere, their instances are terminated by Amazon. Or other off peak usage etc


[08-Jul-18 04:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> there is nothing wrong with non-constant hashrate


[08-Jul-18 04:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> and spot prices could be the reason, off hour computer networks, etc


[08-Jul-18 04:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> I know I am in that category with random hours in the cloud.


[08-Jul-18 04:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> It looks good to me.


[08-Jul-18 04:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> I had it so I figured I would put it out there as a visual reference.


[08-Jul-18 04:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> I think if you had 10-20% of the total hashrate you could expect certain reward qty, but at .5% it is just too small to be predictable in any way over a few weeks.


[08-Jul-18 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> My excellent luck over the last couple of weeks has now migrated back to the norm - with some apparent overshoot....

Moondex?


[08-Jul-18 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cryptopat> When is moodex being activated .... I hear they run on masternodes


[08-Jul-18 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[slackkmd] <jspook16> What is moondex?


[08-Jul-18 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cryptopat> Moon dex is a new decentralized exchange run on master nodes ..... it's only just starting soon apparently (I just heard about it last night)


[08-Jul-18 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cryptopat> Can I ask people what an optimum number of threads to mine with is ?  Should it have anything to do with how  many cores a CPU has ?  I have been using values of 24, 100, 300, and most recently 600 üòÑ


[08-Jul-18 05:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> I look at my CPU usage. I increase the # of threads until it is just under 100%. Going over seem to sometimes drop the hashrate. This is usually the # of cores or just a little over the # of cores.


[08-Jul-18 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <wistar> @bigtom : That is what I have been doing, too.


[08-Jul-18 08:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cryptopat> @bigtom  cheers for the advice .....


[08-Jul-18 08:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cryptopat> The exchange listing is promising, looks like it was going for about 5 bucks a coin ... yippee .... now just need the coins to mature üòÑ


[08-Jul-18 09:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <MasonGreene> For everyone having bad luck with staking I'm sorry to hear about it. I think it just is bad luck though, I have been staking with 374 coins on my laptop and have gotten 3840 time locked ones.


[08-Jul-18 09:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> yes, the way it works is that for each person who is having worse luck than expected, there is someone having better luck than expected. however people having worse luck are 100x more likely to post about it. If you are getting any blocks at all, then you are all setup. Even if you are not getting any blocks if it prints the 256 million hashes, you are mining


[08-Jul-18 10:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @jl777c Any chance that something done in the retargeting affected some nodes or something?   been averaging 4-6 blocks per day then since the retarget block... nothing in the last 28 hours or so.


[08-Jul-18 10:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Hashing with about 1.4 Gh/s


[08-Jul-18 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Probably a case of Post hoc ergo propter hoc


[08-Jul-18 10:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @jimboscott i'm not mining with enough to tell myself. i get a block every few days right now... i will ask Alex if any stats that we are running look off. last I heard, we were seeing things pretty close to target, so not more or less significantly than expected.
I have been getting the expected amount on my staking returns from the ones I bought OTC a while back


[08-Jul-18 10:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Quick question that still seems to float around.... speaking strictly of MINERS - how many blocks per day go to miners?


[08-Jul-18 10:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> about 720, but the difficulty includes all blocks


[08-Jul-18 10:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> so, the right calc is assuming 1440


[08-Jul-18 10:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> So, if I take my hashrate, divide it by the net hash, then multiply x 720 - that is my expected mining rewards...


[08-Jul-18 10:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> 1440


[08-Jul-18 10:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> OK.  That seemed to be more in line with my real world results but a couple of people were telling me to use 720 and not 1440.


[08-Jul-18 10:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> pos calculations should be 1/2'ed, but not PoW


[08-Jul-18 10:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> OK.  Appreciate the help and your being here late...  interesting project and I do not say that about many


[08-Jul-18 10:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I should get about 3.5 per day.  My 4-6 has been good luck and now I am paying the piper.


[08-Jul-18 10:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> PoS has been running at around 52% since the switch, not sure if that is due to the long history at 46% being adjusted for


[08-Jul-18 10:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> last I had checked, it was converging towards 50%, but I did see that it overcompensated at first. should be running normally by now.


[08-Jul-18 10:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Looks like 1695 blocks since I found anything from mining based upon confirmations on my youngest find.


[08-Jul-18 10:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> so, a little over a day


[08-Jul-18 10:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> That's right.


[08-Jul-18 10:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> But my first calendar day with a goose egg.


[08-Jul-18 10:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i've seen rates in the 700's since yesterday, as well as lower than now. seems unlucky, but not many std devs, i would think


[08-Jul-18 10:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Hey... I found 10 on the last day of 384 blocks with a smaller percent of nethash.   Like I said - time to pay the piper now.  Thanks for the advice. Gotta saw some logs now.

[10-Jul-18 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> I am not seeing the benefit of sending people to discord from the media. Just does not seem appropriate.


[10-Jul-18 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we were thinking that it would be better to have a few points and refer people to the original text for details, rather than if there was an error made in writing about it or to know about updates. earning the bounties is through submitting here, as we have to have a reasonable way to manage giving out so much


[10-Jul-18 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> what do you think would cover those things and be better?


[10-Jul-18 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> cut and paste, plus a link could work as well, but with no link, it seems no one will be able to earn a bounty.


[10-Jul-18 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> The issue is the original text is in discord. Many people in their daily lives walk around never knowing about discord. They know and understand the web and PDFs. I understand the need to attract more people in the crypto community that use discord, but I guess ai understood your request to be a general public awareness. Many coins fail or struggle because they never branch out of the crypto community.


[10-Jul-18 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> Everyone has heard of BTC. Going that route sounds like a good path.


[10-Jul-18 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i agree with what you're saying, so do you believe that posting the original text more broadly with links covers things?


[10-Jul-18 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> Maybe housing the original text on versuscoin.io or some other publicly accessible location.


[10-Jul-18 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> ok, but no need to wait for that to cut and paste with links. @englal thoughts?


[10-Jul-18 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> I would be happy see Verus headlining the nightly news as the new block chain that does not have a the 51% problems BTC has. How can we help you get there from here?


[10-Jul-18 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> Given the recent security issues with BTC and the general decline in value, I think it would be good to leverage some of that media momentum.


[10-Jul-18 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763

[10-Jul-18 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> BTW. Wikipedia is on a rampage when it comes to crypto. They are basically not taking any articles about new coins until they are bigger or in the media. They pulled my article on VRSC.


[10-Jul-18 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I'm working on an article about security and will do a video on security soon, but I agree with you and other perspectives. If you have ideas for other places, that would be great, and I'm hoping that the information starts flowing from the community, so that I can put as much focus as possible on getting PBaaS up üòÉ


[10-Jul-18 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> too bad about Wikipedia, but maybe the VerusHash hash function and the fact that it is fully open source and the fastest hash algorithm in the world on CPUs could make somewhere on Wikipedia. We also have our own PoS and PoW/PoS hybrid. Without being about the coin/project itself, those things seem like they'd be interesting to a lot of people as well, which would likely lead them to the project.


[10-Jul-18 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> The verus blockchain is bigger than VRSC. That is for sure, do you have anyone doing professional press releases?


[10-Jul-18 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> If we did, it would be from our group, bounties, or others involved, so though some of us have done that work before, we don't have anyone specifically focused on PR. we do have someone who will be writing bi-weekly newsletter and is coordinating bloggers and video, and we'd certainly welcome that kind of help.

[11-Jul-18 09:54 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
before I completely drive my head through a wall, does verus agama actually use the Komodo komodod or just download the Komodo/supernet.org binaries in order to get nanomsg and others?


[11-Jul-18 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> It uses its own komodod, which should support the same coins as well as Verus. There were some breaking changes in Electrum recently which made SPV not work for coins on our version of Agama, and we are testing the changes to reenable that


[11-Jul-18 10:05 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
OK, because I'm trying to make it work on deb 8.7 and running into issue after issue in trying to build from git


[11-Jul-18 10:07 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I guess my best bet is probably to static the daemon and use that


[11-Jul-18 11:45 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
Well, that turned out to be easier than I thought.
In order to build on "older" systems, one need only remove `-Wint-conversion` from the make file and it builds as expected üòÉ


[11-Jul-18 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <O_User> @bigtom @miketout 

I would think that having a blog/newsfeed with this sort of stuff on the verus.io site would be a good idea, or another domain that has a social networking/blog focus, with comments enabled etc


[11-Jul-18 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <O_User> could be a stream of contributions and news, as well as info pages to refer people to, contact, comment/discussion


[11-Jul-18 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <O_User> not my forte but I think it would make sense. I know there is the reddit too, so that could be developed further as one option


[11-Jul-18 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @O_User I believe @englal is working on some of this stuff. As the coin is a community coin,  there are a lot of coins available for people who take the initiative to do these kinds of things... (hint, hint üòÉ )

[12-Jul-18 01:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <O_User> @miketout awesome, yes I assumed as much but wanted to expand on the ideas of your discussion above

hehe, yes currently trying to figure out how much I can commit, and what will be the best use of my time ;)

I'd love to go all in, but have a habit of over extending. The best stuff I can offer is generally ideas and networking - like, forwarding people I know and persuading them to do stuff. Have been sharing the project around quite a bit. My next person to talk to is a sociologist/data scientist, I will be interested in their opinion on the project (I expect they will love it) and if they want to get involved.

[13-Jul-18 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <O_User> @englal  üòÉ good point. But well, depends if the value of the project is in the price value of the coin or not... One could value the project and not have to follow the price necessarily. If he's still got coins he would've (might've) sold, he's going to have to be a part of the community longer than he may have planned if he was "lucky" enough to get the coins straight off the bat. 

If you are holding coins that you can't touch for 24 months, you probably are going to pay less attention to the price however. It would only be pertinent in the weeks leading up to the unlocking to watch the price. 

I'm here for the project first and foremost, if I get rich at the same time it's a bonus... others, I don't know, but many may see a coin as a coin and an investment opportunity and nothing more. They judge the content and the intent of the coin as part of the valuation of the investment. I really like the dynamic of locked coins though, it's very interesting trying to understand what it means to be involved in a crypto project but not actually have the coin in hand.

As for selling, it's inevitable that over time people will sell some of their holdings. For cash flow, diversification, dealing with debts etc. This way we're just not going to have that leakage in the same way. Although with more users we would hope some would sell to expand the partipant base of the project


[13-Jul-18 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <englal> @O_User Great points all around. I didn't phrase it clearly, but I meant pay attention to the project, rather than pay attention to the price. üòÉ

[14-Jul-18 07:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <O_User> @Gordon Komodo you mean Lil komodo's publicity campaign ;)

I'm a little ambivalent for now about promoting as I want to mine more. On the one hand, one can get bounties that will count towards staking, on the other hand, more competition for said staking expansion. Incentives are a bit tricky. However I am looking into what I can do and am spreading the word. 

@englal üòÉ I know what you meant really, I just wanted to be super clear about what was in my mind and do a bit of thinking aloud. I notice it does take some time for the timelock idea to sink in, and then one would have to re-adjust their decision whether to get involved in the project and evaluate their approach. It's a pretty awesome angle IMO

[14-Jul-18 09:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @cryptopat You can get the privkey from the wallet you want to move from then import the privkey ONE AT A TIME using the import private key function.
DO NOT try to import multiple private keys.  That does NOT work and sort of screws things up a bit by locking out those privkeys without fully importing them.   
It is very easy, but you just need to know where to get the privkeys and avoid the mistake of trying to import a list of them instead of one at a time.  I cannot stress that enough - ONE AT A TIME.

[14-Jul-18 09:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <O_User> I've done one at a time mostly so far, had some problems with wallet scan and it not showing up, but they arrived safe and sound once I imported again and did a wallet scan


[14-Jul-18 09:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <O_User> I think I did also do a couple with dumpwallet and there was no option to wallet rescan on import so same issue that I couldn't see that they had imported, so didn't like it, but it worked


[14-Jul-18 10:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @O_User I tried to import a set of private keys by following the instructions on the Agama wallet.  They did not import and, when I then tried to import them one at a time - they would not import singly either.  I believe the wallet partially imported somehow during the attempt at multiple key importation and that led the wallet to ignore the single key import after that.  I had to restore my wallet.dat to a previous state  before I could get them to import as singles.  @miketout confirmed that the multiple import should be avoided.  Pretty sure that's who it was.

[dscrdvrsc] <DaveArcher> is block height xxxx related to hash rate?


[14-Jul-18 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <silkspinner> @DaveArcher  Block height is simply the length of the Verus chain , the total number of blocks . Hash rate is a measurement of mining activity, basically one guess at winning a block. The hash rate of your miners can be compared to the total network hash rate to estimate the likelihood of your winning a particular block. See FAQ for how to do that calculation.

[15-Jul-18 10:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @hastrup Right for what?


[15-Jul-18 10:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Your Agama wallet starts with a pool of addresses and keys.  The wallet mines each reward to a different address and a different privkey.  They are all correct in the sense that they are all supposed to be there.


[15-Jul-18 10:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> If you need to know which addresses have actually been used then you have to look at each transactions's details.


[15-Jul-18 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <silkspinner> @stretcher83  I feel your pain, it's some serious hard rock mining down in the Verus mines these days with the hash rate growing. But take heart., more miners should mean that the coins we have are more likely to be worth something.


[15-Jul-18 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <JoeCrypto> Just hope the earlier miners don‚Äôt dump  at cheap prices.  All the immature coins will be worth nothing.


[15-Jul-18 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <silkspinner> I think the time locked blocks will work to diminish that phenomenon of folks cashing out and moving on. I know that I intend to keep on mining Verus , seems to be a great project with big plans.


[15-Jul-18 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @JoeCrypto With a 50% POS reward... do you really think it would be wise to dump? 

And it's not like miners have that much to recoup in the way of power costs either.


[15-Jul-18 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <O_User> "dump at cheap prices" at one point in time may be a possibility, but then there's 24 months of possible price change for immature blocks...

[15-Jul-18 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <O_User> indeed... gosh remembering eth always leads me to "if only" ;)

there was so much pessimism for a while...

I reckon anyone who has any strategic thinking ability at all (which is likely to be anyone who was mining from early) will not be looking to dump, but there may be some loosening of the early coins into the market as they just do have less relative value to early miners/stakers who may feel they have commited enough and might need some money. It will be interesting to see. I guess the counter point needs to be some trading hype and the general awareness campaign that is underway


[15-Jul-18 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <O_User> also with more potential liquidity we can talk about higher profile exchanges - it's quite a task to sign up to yet another (unproven) exchange, password, 2fa, deposit etc just for a coin that you might like or might be a good investment... in general people like familiarity and ease of access. I guess it depends what the target market is atm and if it's still focusing on early supporters who get what Verus core values are

[17-Jul-18 07:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <iO_User> @ok88 as far as I can tell the very recent active bounties program is in order for the devs to spend less time on the community and more time on developing. It's also an indication to me that they acquired near the figures they were expecting from early mining/staking and are now ready to share their proceeds with the community in order to stimulate growth, which was their plan from the beginning. I have also seen comments from miketout that he is busy developing at the moment. 

For the roadmap, I didn't see dates and times exactly, but I saw the different phases they want to implement in the vision paper


[17-Jul-18 08:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Maybe, just maybe, the locked coins concept will attract a more disciplined and long range outlook crowd.  That would certainly be nice as profit-miners have taken just about everything else I have down the crapper.

California Changes Rules for Independent Contractors Classification
In the United States, both at the federal and state level, workers can be classified as either ‚Äúemployees‚Äù or ‚Äúindependent contractors.‚Äù This distinction carries significant tax repercussions for business owners, particularly with regard to payroll

[17-Jul-18 07:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @bigtom I have had to deal with these kinds of things myself.  Reclassifying contractor/employee relationships is tricky.  It puts the burden for taxation on the employer, but the rules governing intellectual property will probably also be skewed in the employer's favor as any work output from an employee is generally automatically considered the intellectual property of the employer.  I am a professional photographer. As long as I am independent, copyright laws automatically protect me.  If I was classified as a photographer AND an employee I do not have a leg to stand on.  Would not surprise me if the software industry was not cheering this on in secret....


[17-Jul-18 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Independent contractors would address intellectual property concerns through contracts.  There, the contractor has some room for negotiation.  Not so if an employee.

[18-Jul-18 04:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @bigtom Work for hire has to be clearly spelled out in the contract if you are an independent contractor.   In the 30+ years I have been shooting architecture I have maybe done 4-5 WFH assignments and they were set up that way due to proprietary information that was in the photos.  Not sure how coding typically works.  For me, the playing surface is clearly slanted in my favor when it comes to IP law.


[18-Jul-18 04:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> On another topic... I am rather surprised (but also willing to take advantage...) that the net hash rate is where it is.  Right now... between 500 and 600 Gh/s.  Assuming an average hash rate of the casual CPU miner being about 150 Mh/s (Kaby Lake i5 can do this by itself), that means there are about 4000 computers mining this right now - worldwide.   That is really tiny.   Surprisingly tiny.

[19-Jul-18 06:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @Scrotum Tickler In the slower laptop - have you checked for other processes that might be running?  Are the two CPU's identical or just both i7's?   I have an i7 in one of my old desktops that pulls about 40 mh/s and another doing 230.  The difference there is the generation of the CPU and perhaps some chipset limitations too.

[19-Jul-18 09:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @Scrotum Tickler Just that you check the other running processes and, as @Lil komodo said - wallet versions.  The difference between 0.3.8 and 0.3.9 is not as great as your disparity, but it is pretty close.


[19-Jul-18 12:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <wistar> @Scrotum Tickler: I've had this happen. Are the connection counts the same?

Are they networked via WiFi or ethernet/hard-wired? If the latter, try switching connections between the two and see if the slow hash follows.

Either WiFi or ethernet: You can try:
```ipconfig /release
ipconfig /renew```
to get a new lease and see if that is the culprit.

Finally, try stopping Agama on the slow laptop, let it exit completely, shut the machine down (rather than just re-starting), start the machine and than try loading and running Agama again. This has usually worked for me.

[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> is there an  easy way for GUI to shield coin with a click of button?


[19-Jul-18 11:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> @Gordon Komodo yes, a few clicks. Taken from my #faq-chosen " So, once your coins loose their time lock, in the GUI first generate a private address and then go to the ‚ÄûSend‚Äú screen and use ‚ÄûShield a coinbase transaction‚Äú (will take some time, likely 5 min, but may be up to 20 min, much longer than from a public/transparent address to another). Finally you transfer the coins from your private address back to (one of) your public / transparent address(es) and you‚Äôll automatically start staking."

[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> did you follow the FAQ2


[21-Jul-18 12:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> Q: How do I direct all my mined rewards to a single Verus wallet?
A: 
Step 1 - First get your wallet address you want to mine to:
IN AGAMA GUI
Click "Receive", click "Get New Address" and choose "Transparent Address" from the drop down.
IN VERUS-CLI
You can find an address if you already have previous transactions, or you can create a new one.  To find an address from a previous transaction, use the command line verus listtransactions and copy the address found after "address".
To generate a new wallet address, use the command line verus getnewaddress and a new address will be created.

Step 2 - Next, using your new address, enter the command with verus-cli verus validateaddress. From the output find the long string after "pubkey", copy without the quotation marks.

Step 3 - Last, use this pubkey when starting your daemon by adding the following line to the end of your command, just before the "&" sign: -pubkey=THELONGSTRINGCOPIED

Your rewards will now be mined to that address.  It would be a good idea to keep notes and associate the wallet address with the pubkey...also to double check that you did validate the correct pubkey for the wallet address, making sure you made no errors.(edited)

[22-Jul-18 05:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Just a heads up hours before I actually post an announcement, we are planning to release an update today that includes major improvements and additional features in Agama:
1. Includes support for the Electrum changes that recently broke SPV (lite mode) for other coins in our version of Agama. 
2. Includes the new Agama core feature of "Hide sensitive data", which obscures amounts and addresses on screen to allow screen shots without exposing sensitive data.
3. We've also added a new capability in our version of Agama only to easily send and receive encrypted memos along with Verus z-transactions, even for a zero amount and just the fee. This allows zero knowledge privacy and strong encryption in sending messages, which we think is pretty cool and useful both now and for applications in the future.
I'm going to announce it as a critical update for both the GUI and command line, which everyone will want to be on by the halving. More details and downloads soon üòÉ

[22-Jul-18 10:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> is this code public yet?


[22-Jul-18 10:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> or just empty blocks? i haven't heard it was ready to use for processing transactions


[22-Jul-18 10:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the code is in a public repo, but i didn't think it was ready to use for anything but testing.


[22-Jul-18 10:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i would hope that we don't end up with people mining a lot of empty blocks. we gave a bounty for it to be finished, so it could be used fully functional.


[22-Jul-18 10:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @superslack the answer, as I understand it, is that the GPU mining is not ready to be used yet, and if someone is using it now, I thought it would only be for testing. the fastest GPUs are not beating CPUs, and I believed we were going to get it finished before announcing it for anyone to use. I don't know if @Alright is using it or testing with @Decker who is writing it. I also hadn't heard it was ready to use and am focused right now on getting the release I described out. I'm waiting for a response from Decker and Alright. If it's not mining transactions yet and people are using it, I hope people stop using it before it's ready or we get transaction processing in, not just testing.

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @dukeleto i believe for a couple reasons related to testing, we are considering a delay in the messaging feature. we will still do the release. that zero amount capability was expected, but we are seeing a requirement to send at least the fee amount caused by the bug you describe.

[23-Jul-18 01:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Alright @Decker told me that you are helping him test, and it sounds like the data that you guys are getting is quite useful and still very supportive of indefinite CPU mining. He also said that it won't be processing transactions and ready for real use for maybe a month or more. For everyone, if I hear anything about a threatening GPU miner, I will let you know. What I've heard so far on this work, which is supposed to already be perf optimized to some degree, is that when it is ready, it won't beat CPUs, but if you already have a high end card or two, it will be a nice mining option. it also seems to bottleneck pretty hard on systems with multiple cards or risers, as it is very sensitive to data transfer speeds. still work in progress.

[23-Jul-18 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> still haven't heard anything from them except for the first bot response


[23-Jul-18 07:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Dzimmy> I'll send them an email as well. Maybe if they see more than 1 email regarding an issue they'll give it a higher priority.  Wish I could be of more help but I'm not very familiar with reddit's rules and regs. Hopefully it get's sorted out soon and if I receive a response I will be sure to let you know.


[23-Jul-18 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i'm not sure either. michaeltoutjr also sent them mail before I knew. maybe they assume we are the same person with 2 accounts or something. i really have no idea why the community was banned, and none of the mods have gotten notice or an explanation yet.


[23-Jul-18 07:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> if anyone wants to send a message, i don't see how it could hurt. thanks


[24-Jul-18 01:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lucivere> I also emailed reddit!


[24-Jul-18 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Lucivere thanks. none of the mods have heard anything back from them. I didn't even realize something like this could happen with no notice, no reason, and no answer. I'm concerned about making a new community there until we figure this out, but they seem to have no method of doing so reliably.


[24-Jul-18 09:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lucivere> I got a very cryptic (haha!) mail in response to my ticket. The only word in it was ¬´dnr¬ª.
Errr, ok...? I wrote back asking what that was supposed to mean:P


[24-Jul-18 09:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Do Not Resuscitate (DNR)
That is VERY strange.


[24-Jul-18 09:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Lucivere what else was in your mail response? what made it seem like haha?


[24-Jul-18 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lucivere> That‚Äôs precisely what I wrote! I also think of the medical term! The haha was just for my use of cryptic given we‚Äôre into crypto;)
Nothing else at all from the reddit support person, just... dnr


[24-Jul-18 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> This seems almost as if it's not random or a mistake, but that the community was targeted. We have seen a very obnoxious troll on bitcointalk making false claims. I wonder if there is some connection. I would have expected more from Reddit, but I guess I have no experience that tells me I should. I'm about ready to ask everyone for help on this, as we are getting no information from Reddit so far. As far as I know, we violated no rules whatsoever.


[24-Jul-18 09:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> It's common practice for BTC and BCH (and various zec forks) people to fight and ban each others subreddits and all kinds of shenanigans. I would not be surprised if it's a competitor coin or just some bored internet trolls. Sadly, this is common on Reddit


[24-Jul-18 10:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> how does someone even ban someone else's subreddit? corruption in reddit admins?


[24-Jul-18 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lucivere> Considering the many adult subs (nudity and gore for example), I would say Verus‚Äô sub was quite innocent! If they reply back to me, I‚Äôll update ofc


[24-Jul-18 10:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Not just the type of content, based on their rules, we can find nothing violated that we know of ... considering next steps, so if anyone has ideas or knows someone at Reddit, please let me know. Thanks!

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I'm also very low on staking still. I was thinking it was getting back to normal, but it hasn't yet. if it's caused by someone gaining an unfair advantage, that should go away at the halving. To figure out if there's anything like that, I will look at the blockchain to see if there are standout staking addresses that are making more than they statistically should.


[24-Jul-18 03:27 PM] digital bullion#8223
Hi all,  just curious as to how many threads I should be running in the Verus mining wallet, as to achieve the greatest efficiency and chance of mining a block. I am just mining with my desktop cpu.  Any advice is appreciated üßê


[24-Jul-18 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> I just have a shitty laptop on it


[24-Jul-18 04:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoAlex> Not sure if this apply for mining, but usually a CPU can handle one thread for each core. Some of them have "hyper threading technology" and can handle two threads for each core. If you are using windows just press Ctrl+Shift+Esc and look for "Logical Processors" under Performance tab


[24-Jul-18 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Mining about 24 hours, no blocks (none expected, the math says I should get one every 11-12 days)

[dscrdvrsc] <Lil komodo> @BigCat45  no vpn


[24-Jul-18 05:31 PM] digital bullion#8223
Awesome. I thought it may be related to the number of cpu cores and cpu ‚Äòhyper threading‚Äô.
Thank you for the clarification.


[24-Jul-18 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Tommygun007> 8 days without a block lol it will come soon

[24-Jul-18 10:49 PM] Gateway#3763

[25-Jul-18 05:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Someone recommended me to switch mining to verus from graft.

I can‚Äôt find much in terms of reviews or info.

Any help would be appreciated


[25-Jul-18 05:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Is there any pools or solo mining?


[25-Jul-18 05:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> @ChrisC30a hi remember me üòÅ


[25-Jul-18 05:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> I very much do üòâ

I‚Äôve been trying to find more info


[25-Jul-18 05:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> The problem your having finding reviews and tutorials for verus is because its still so new to the crypto scene


[25-Jul-18 05:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Which is sort of good for you and me because we still have a good chance of beating all the hoards of miners to the big rewards


[25-Jul-18 05:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> So basically it‚Äôs a gamble, get in while it‚Äôs under the radar.


[25-Jul-18 05:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Everything is a gamble, I‚Äôll rephrase that üòâ


[25-Jul-18 05:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> I have spare resource not doing much as it‚Äôs older multi core CPU‚Äôs. Being written for cpu mining I might be able to utilise some wasted resource


[25-Jul-18 05:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Sort of, i mean solo mining has a big luck factor in it, eg say 1 person has got 700mh/s  and you have got 50mh/s , dont think because they have got a lot more hash power than you means you wont get anything, it just means they will have a better chance at getting blocks than you, but you could still find a block or more just like they did


[25-Jul-18 05:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> If you increase your hashrate to say 500mh/s you could find more than before or you could still be waiting days to find  a block


[25-Jul-18 05:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Iv only found 2 blocks in 24 days with only 61mh/s


[25-Jul-18 05:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> I had about 7kh/s with etn then switched to graft and it dropped to about 3.5kh/s

Same miner.


[25-Jul-18 05:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> But its not turning me mining because i know i will get more soon, but if i didnt start mining verus coin now and i started say in 10 months time i would think my odds at finding blocks would be greatly diminished


[25-Jul-18 05:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> How does it work if you have multiple rigs? Do they create your own pool or does each rig mine independently? Each one has its own chance of finding a block, of one does then the other will be able to help or not be able to?


[25-Jul-18 05:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Last time i checked the verus coin network hashrate was 650gh , it could be treble that in 10 months


[25-Jul-18 05:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Which makes it alot harder to find blocks


[25-Jul-18 05:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> More people on the network means more miners fighting for blocks


[25-Jul-18 05:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Very interesting, I‚Äôll dedicate a couple of rigs to it.


[25-Jul-18 05:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I am using 2 pc‚Äôs at the moment with 2 separate wallets , most people on here are using multiple machines , iv not dived in to combining wallets to mine to one address but i know others have, but im pretty sure even if you have 50 machines going they are all just solo mining not creating there own pool , but you could say in your head that your combined hadhrate from them 50 machines is your own virtual pool because any wallet you own that finds  blocks is yours


[25-Jul-18 05:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> You would control the whole hashrate of your machines


[25-Jul-18 05:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Its a bit confusing at first


[25-Jul-18 05:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> I see, so basically each machine you assign increases your chance of finding a block


[25-Jul-18 05:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Yes exactly


[25-Jul-18 05:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> What the hell, I‚Äôll give it a go while it‚Äôs still new üòä


[25-Jul-18 05:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> What platform are you on?  Windows, MacOS or Linux?


[25-Jul-18 05:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lucivere> If you have rigs that are gpu mining, why not use the cpu‚Äôs to mine Verus:) As long as your cpu‚Äôs support it ofc


[25-Jul-18 05:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Also i believe you don‚Äôt accumulate hash shares for each rig so if you leave one rig mining for like 2 days solid but you need to restart your pc for some reason you would not lose any built up hash shares


[25-Jul-18 05:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> That‚Äôs a good shout, my rigs are older machines that were top of the range when new. The gpu‚Äôs are poor or not supported.

I mainly cpu mine, gpu‚Äôs count towards less than 10% of my hashing power


[25-Jul-18 05:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lucivere> Heck, my daughter‚Äôs laptop which is a low i5 around three years old is mining and has also found a block:P


[25-Jul-18 05:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Great, once the block is found is it yours until mined? Or can someone else steal that block?


[25-Jul-18 05:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lucivere> You get coins as a reward:)


[25-Jul-18 05:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Yeah, sorry I mean until completed. I guess you only get the reward once the block is complete?


[25-Jul-18 05:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> The block is yours if it stays in your imature block balance for like an hour or so or maybe less


[25-Jul-18 05:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Iv not seen one come in my wallet and then disappear but i have heard of it


[25-Jul-18 05:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Cool, ok. That makes sense


[25-Jul-18 05:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> For the moment all blocks found will be time locked for a specific amount of time


[25-Jul-18 05:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> My fist block has got 324 days untill it matures, my second block has got 6 months before it matures


[25-Jul-18 05:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> I‚Äôm not entirely sure what that means, I‚Äôve ever only mined as part of pools.

Compile my own miners and keep them up to date.


[25-Jul-18 05:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> There is a halfing coming very soon wher all blocks found after the halfing will have 96 coins instead of 192 coins , and non of them will be time locked


[25-Jul-18 05:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I didnt understand this point when i first started mining verus but over time iv come to understand it better


[25-Jul-18 05:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> They locked the early blocks so that people wouldnt just pump and dump coins on there network,


[25-Jul-18 05:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Aw I see, I‚Äôm a hoarder üòÇüòÇ

[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I am a hoarder also üòÅ


[25-Jul-18 05:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> I have a large variety of coins, lost a small fortune but oh well


[25-Jul-18 05:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Haha!! Great minds think alike


[25-Jul-18 05:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> I don‚Äôt buy anymore, just mine


[25-Jul-18 05:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> So basically the wallet is all you need? It‚Äôs also the miner?

Hence when you said about having multiple wallets, makes sense now.


[25-Jul-18 05:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Im in the frame of mind that crypto will take over the world soon quietly and quickly , or maybe in 10 years but its defo coming, so the more crypto i can amass now in the early days the more happy me and my family will be in the future, also i like the community‚Äôs that im following so im having fun along the way, so yes all you need is that agama wallet open and mining and thats your miner and wallet in one


[25-Jul-18 05:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> The one thing i found the most helpfull was how to back up your wallet if you have blocks or coins in it


[25-Jul-18 05:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Its not very intuitive , but i found out if on windows you need to go to %appdatta% folder then roaming then make a backup copy of the agama and komodo folders, iv heard all you really need is your wallet.bat file thats located in one of the folders but i just back up both folders and keep them safe


[25-Jul-18 05:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Yeah, it‚Äôs difficult to keep on top of.

I have a portfolio, keep some in binance, some managed by the ledger.

Binance isn‚Äôt ideal but it‚Äôs all on one place


[25-Jul-18 05:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Iv got a bit of bitcoin on coinbase then some more sat on nicehash and a hadfull of other coins that iv mined so far, same as you not a big fortune but its getting bigger by the day üòÜ


[25-Jul-18 05:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> In 6 moths i only managed to mine 573 etn coins


[25-Jul-18 05:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Worth only about ¬£5 now but it helped me get in to mining so i happy with what i got


[25-Jul-18 05:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> About the cpu instruction set, you will need to check your cpu and make sure its got the aes and or avx instructions set on it , the wallet wont work without them


[25-Jul-18 06:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I used speccy to find out under the cpu section but theres loads of programs out there to check if you dont like speccy


[25-Jul-18 06:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> One more thing about solo mining is you wont get any rewards at all untill you find a block, it could take days or weeks depending on your own hashrate , but the rewards are big if you do


[25-Jul-18 06:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lucivere> We‚Äôre in the starting phase of what looks to become a very good community:)


[25-Jul-18 06:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Hopefully pools will open soon after the halfing and we can start to get more regular rewards


[25-Jul-18 06:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I will second that @Lucivere


[25-Jul-18 06:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> And congratulations on finding a block all ready, will you be sharing the block with your daughter after all it is her laptop , or are you keeping it quiet üòÅüòÜ


[25-Jul-18 06:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> How long would it typically take to mine a block?

[25-Jul-18 06:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I got told myself with 29mh at first, would take me 18 days to find a block, but it only took 4 days.


[25-Jul-18 06:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I was waiting 15 days after that to find my second block


[25-Jul-18 06:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> But i upped my hashrate to 61mh after i found the first block


[25-Jul-18 06:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> There is a calculation to work out how long it could take you but i dont know it, its defo on these chats somewhere though, maybe the #faq section


[25-Jul-18 06:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lucivere> I have found lots of blocks, started up in May on my own comp;) But her laptop just recently, like two weeks ago. She‚Äôs got like 37mh/s, not a lot! She‚Äôll get a percentage of the reward, when the coins are matured. In a year;)

[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> There is a basic guide I found on github but it only covers a couple of the options

[25-Jul-18 07:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Hi , glad you got it working


[25-Jul-18 07:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Looks like you managed to get it to sync with the blockchain


[25-Jul-18 07:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Mine only took about 5-10 mins first time üëçüèº


[25-Jul-18 07:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> When its 100% synced up , click the mining box to expand it then choose the number of threads you want to mine with and click start , your hash rate should build up slowly over a few hours till it reaches its max mh/s , its a good idea to keep an eye on your cpu usage , task manager i use , it just gives you a rough idea whats going on because the gui wallet only says mining with your hashrate


[25-Jul-18 07:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I have a quad core cpu but i only run it on 2 threads, my cpu temperature is pretty high, only got stock coolers on them for now


[25-Jul-18 07:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Great thanks.

Will the cpu still be working hard even without any blocks to mine?

[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> @ChrisC30a i dont think your cpu would get used too much while your just syncing up to the block chain but it will use a small amount like any other task on pc‚Äôs


[25-Jul-18 08:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> @ChrisC30a  im interested if you managed to get your wallet working , you mentioned that your cpu doesn‚Äôt have the aes instructions set but it does have the avx , a hear a lot of people saying they dont have either instructions set and carnt get it to work, my 2 pc‚Äôs have both aes and avx and iv never had any problems, info on your wallet install could help more people in the future


[25-Jul-18 08:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Great thanks, that‚Äôs good.


[25-Jul-18 08:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Sorry, I have 2x 6 core Xeon‚Äôs in my rig. They have aes but don‚Äôt have avx


[25-Jul-18 08:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Oh right, üëçüèº i got mixed up on that then, same applies though, no avx but if you do have aes it will work


[25-Jul-18 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Im seeing mentioned alot  lately that the first time people try and install  agama wallet it seems to fail, but if they keep restarting the wallet and or trying diffrent things it seems to start working


[25-Jul-18 08:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I can see some people trying to install it the first time and getting stuck on errors and just giving up thinking there cpu is no good for mining verus


[25-Jul-18 08:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Not everyone knows about discord channels so it must be frustrating when it wont work and theres no one to help you out, i can see a lot of people giving up at that point


[25-Jul-18 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Yeah finally got it working


[25-Jul-18 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763

[25-Jul-18 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Also you should create exemptions in your anti virus software incase it try‚Äôs to quarantine files from agama wallet


[25-Jul-18 08:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> I don‚Äôt have that option, not what I can see

[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Got it...


[25-Jul-18 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I believe the folders you should add exemptions for are the folder that you use to start the agama wallet, and also 2 folders from inside the %appdata% folder , they are the agama folder and the komodo folder

[25-Jul-18 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> How are people regularly backing up the wallet? Syncing it to the cloud?


[25-Jul-18 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Yes


[25-Jul-18 09:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> And also i personaly make a backup folder with both the agama and komodo folders from %appdata% folder and keep it safe, make a new backup every time i find a new block


[25-Jul-18 09:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> That makes sense, play it safe.


[25-Jul-18 09:09 AM] Gateway#3763

[25-Jul-18 09:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @ChrisC30a I am interested to see what kind of hash rate you get without AVX... can you share when it has been mining for 20-30 minutes?


[25-Jul-18 09:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Yeah of course. It‚Äôs saying 0 at the moment. Guess because waiting for a block


[25-Jul-18 10:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> It‚Äôs saying 2.54 is that good or bad?

I‚Äôm used to see it in h/s


[25-Jul-18 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Have you got a bit more info on your cpu, model number üëçüèº

[dscrdvrsc] <silkspinner> KMD up 30% in 24hr, moved up to 72nd position on  cryptocompare.com üòÄ


[25-Jul-18 11:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @ChrisC30a You are likely losing a huge amount of potential hashing because you are missing the AVX extensions.  I have i7's hashing at 230 mh/s - almost 100 times faster than 2.54.   If you really are getting 2.54 mh/s then the expected rewards would be about .004 blocks per day.   250 days for a block.


[25-Jul-18 11:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Thats a crying shame that,maybe linux is a better option for him ?


[25-Jul-18 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Likely not.  The issue is the CPU's capabilities.

[25-Jul-18 11:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Is that calculation based on current system@ state or the system in general?

Because the cpu is currently working its little pants off


[25-Jul-18 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I understand that.  But if the CPU is having to do something that is not native, then the efficiency is just not there.  Your CPU is pre-Sandy Bridge.  I have a Sandy Bridge i7 that is probably one of the first CPU's to have the AVX extension.  It does about 32 Mh/s as compared to 230 Mh/s that a Kaby Lake i7 is doing.  And, that is WITH the AVX instruction set.


[25-Jul-18 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Your CPU is working very hard - no doubt.  But it is trying to take down a section of a prison wall with a tack hammer.


[25-Jul-18 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> And it is likely still very good at many tasks... this is just not one of them.


[25-Jul-18 11:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Maybe nothing but does it work any better on less threads, like try 8 threads instead of 12, but stop the wallet mining first then try 8 threads , if it doesn‚Äôt work i would think thats it


[25-Jul-18 11:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Theres always more cpu‚Äôs out there üòÅ


[25-Jul-18 11:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @stretcher83 WHen the devs released the latest versions of the wallet and CLI miner, they stated that the wallet would run on non-AVX CPU's but at a significantly lower level of efficiency.   Prior to this release the wallet would not even run at all on older CPU's that were missing AVX.


[25-Jul-18 12:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> That‚Äôs interesting and a shame really


[25-Jul-18 12:00 PM] Gateway#3763

[25-Jul-18 12:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I had a very inexpensive G4400 that was running a 7 GPU rig just fine - wallet would not run on it.


[25-Jul-18 12:01 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Wish I did but all my funds are tied up


[25-Jul-18 12:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> About 500 bucks USD and you could get 400 Mh/s or better.

[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Take a thumb drive to MicroCenter and run the CLI wallet on every machine you can get it on...  JK


[25-Jul-18 12:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Does the cli wallet run better?


[25-Jul-18 12:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Same thing - just a different face plate


[25-Jul-18 12:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> I have a gaming rig I could try it on


[25-Jul-18 12:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> What CPU in it?


[25-Jul-18 12:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> My son runs it on his gaming box.


[25-Jul-18 12:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Not entirely sure, I would need to check specs but it‚Äôs mainly all gpu


[25-Jul-18 12:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> I‚Äôll find something, got a decent laptop


[25-Jul-18 12:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> If you do the laptop - elevate it a bit on the very sides and probably should not run all cores.  Air circulation will be important.


[25-Jul-18 12:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> So when we say it will run slowly on a system without aes and avx do we mean just linux and mac , and it wont run at all on a windows machine @jimboscott üëçüèº


[25-Jul-18 12:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @stretcher83 Those things have nothing to do with the OS.  They are chip capabilities that are hard coded in the CPU.


[25-Jul-18 12:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> the latest wallet has a software workaround - but compared to a native ability in the CPU - it is super inefficient.


[25-Jul-18 12:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> All of my mining is Windows.

[25-Jul-18 12:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> If I was to set up a rig with a better cpu any advantages of Linux over windows?

Windows should be a fairly quick set up


[25-Jul-18 12:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Got to love the reset function in windows 10


[25-Jul-18 12:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I need to ask because a friend of mine has multiple old motherboards from second hand pc‚Äôs or hand me downs, and the last two he tried didnt have aes or avx so its a bit frustrating for him , as you can imagine üòÅ


[25-Jul-18 12:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> I can relate... I have allot of old and spare kit

[dscrdvrsc] <AlephNull> question:  I downloaded Agama 0.3.11-beta from verus website and it got to part of wallet sync and just stuck there - admittedly just on a relatively low end or mid end laptop - 64 bit Windows 8. Is there a time expectation of when that would sync? plan to get a larger computer later for mining but just wanted to explore it a bit on my laptop.


[26-Jul-18 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <silkspinner> @AlephNull  It can take some time to synch, 10-15 min on my last install, but you should see blue bar showing progress. If not try closing Agama wallet and restarting.  Welcome to the Verus community!


[26-Jul-18 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763

[27-Jul-18 04:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <That_Guy8> @Budd maybe attempt to close and reopen. the red exclamation on the other one means ithe CPU may not have AES or AVX so check that if it doesn't it cant mine under windows

What's the appropriate way to backup a mined wallet via cli? getbalance won't show until the coins are unlocked, but listtransactions shows what I believe are mined blocks. I try to bring the privkeys into agama but I do not show anything.


[27-Jul-18 06:23 PM] bishop#9773
I ran the daemon with pubkey flag set to a public address I control but none of the coins appear to be mined to that address


[27-Jul-18 09:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <silkspinner> @Matterbridge  The basic steps to backup a wallet : Stop Verus Daemon/Service, backup VRSC/wallet.dat, Start Verus again


[27-Jul-18 09:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <silkspinner> @Matterbridge  The  specifc commands will vary depending on your OS.  On Win the wallet.dat lives in C:\Users\(username)\AppData\Roaming\komodo\VRSC for Linux ~/.komodo/VRSC

[27-Jul-18 09:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <silkspinner> @Meyse  I believe there is a minor issue on the "Fair and Decentralized" image. It states  "blocks larger than 96" are locked, should be "192 or larger". During ramp up week, there were blocks larger than 96 that were unlocked.

How is everyone mining to a single address or are they constantly backing up their wallet.dat?


[27-Jul-18 09:38 PM] bishop#9773
keypool size should be like 100 or 1000 but still, just curious


[27-Jul-18 10:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @Matterbridge There is a way to force the CLI miner to mine to a single public key.   I have been doing that for about 2 weeks and it works like a charm.  It is in the FAQ section.  However, one thing that I found to be easier than what is in the FAQ is to get your public key from the GUI wallet.  It is super easy.  Go to your "Receive" section and pick one of your addresses - click the three dot menu to the left of the address and choose 'validate address'.  That will open up a blue/green box that has various data.  near the BOTTOM of that data, just above 'iscompressed: true' is your pubkey.  I found that MUCH easier than typing all of the directories and such in a CMD prompt window.   Once you have your pubkey (do NOT get confused and use the scriptPubKey found near the top of the blue/green box) follow the instruction in the FAQ on how to insert this into the startup command for the CLI miner.

[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I still cannot figure out why this is not around 10-15 Th/s.   At ~600 Gh/s there are probably no more than 1000 people mining this worldwide.  It just seems that SO many miners would have CPU's essentially just idling...


[28-Jul-18 05:30 AM] Gateway#3763

[28-Jul-18 05:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Absolutely.  I look forward to the day when the block reward is 12 and CPU's and GPU's have pushed this to a healthy fraction of a Ph/s.


[28-Jul-18 05:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <benohanlon> I'm messaging about 200 people a day on LinkedIn with the pocket guide under the search results for 'cryptocurrency mining' @jimboscott

[dscrdvrsc] <benohanlon> I've about 7K results to work through


[28-Jul-18 05:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Its because when we try mining with little hash power, eg 61mg/s its , it very disheartening and frustrating not getting a block untill 16 days go by, im all for waiting for my rewards, it makes them all that more special, but when people say they get 10 blocks in a day and there luck just keeps going its hard for people to see any chance of finding a block with the small hashrate they can afford, im not havin a go or nothing but i can see a lot of people trying verus out then moving on quick because of no rewards


[28-Jul-18 05:48 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> It is slowly going up.  But I wonder if it's doing anything as there is only an on off button


[28-Jul-18 05:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> @Godballz i was speaking to @ChrisC30a yesterday, he seems to be having a similar issue, hes got i7 4770 thats only giving him 1.6mh if i remember correctly


[28-Jul-18 05:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Hmm so it is low


[28-Jul-18 05:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> It does take a small amount of time for your hashrate to go up


[28-Jul-18 05:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Like 2 hours or so, maybe less for some


[28-Jul-18 05:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yeah it's gone up to 16 in about 30 mins maybe a bit more


[28-Jul-18 05:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Sounds good


[28-Jul-18 05:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Thnks for the help man I'm digging this app


[28-Jul-18 05:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Poor @ChrisC30a  didnt seem to be moving up from 1.6mh


[28-Jul-18 05:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That sucks I wonder if it's better now


[28-Jul-18 05:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Hope he got it sorted


[28-Jul-18 05:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Hope so. Do you guys run GPU miners along with this? Mining rvn at same time, forgot to mention that


[28-Jul-18 05:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I mine daggerhashimoto on nice hash aswell as verus on my cpu‚Äôs


[28-Jul-18 05:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Iv got 2 pc‚Äôs mining veruscoin


[28-Jul-18 05:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Only got 61mh/s but found 2 blocks since i started


[28-Jul-18 06:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Tonight - in about 15 hours - the possibility of pool mining arrives.   Those with less hash power will hopefully be able to get some more predictable results.  I am not aware of anyone who is definitely planning a pool, but with all rewards being unlocked from this point forward pool mining becomes practical.


[28-Jul-18 06:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <That_Guy8> for GPU mines have you sussed Merit.me out? Nvidia mining only but seeing around $4-$5 AUD per 1080Ti / day in returns

[28-Jul-18 06:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Just looking in to it now


[28-Jul-18 06:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <That_Guy8> no dramas mate. just grab their light wallet, go to mine section then select GPUs set threads low or it will use CPU and go


[28-Jul-18 06:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <That_Guy8> *Note it is CPU heavy ATM but it has minimal impact on verus if your also mining that

[28-Jul-18 07:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @That_Guy8 However - please note that the Meritminer GPU miner will require about 70% of your CPU as well...


[28-Jul-18 07:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> So Verus mining will come to a near halt when mining MRT with GPU's


[28-Jul-18 07:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Unless they just fixed that...


[28-Jul-18 07:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Dont worry, im sticking with verus


[28-Jul-18 07:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Thanks for the info @That_Guy8 but im well into verus cpu mining so dont think i could manage any cpu usage to anything else


[28-Jul-18 07:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Nice hash dosnt hurt my verus mining at all


[28-Jul-18 07:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I will keep merit miner in mind for future projects i might get in to , üëçüèº


[28-Jul-18 07:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <That_Guy8> @jimboscott I dual mine verus and merit without much impact.


[28-Jul-18 07:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I noticed that minergate uses alot of my cpu when i only set the gpu to mine ether but on nice hash it hardly touches the cpu when only gpu mining


[28-Jul-18 08:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Plus i like the bitcoin i get from nice hash üëçüèº


[28-Jul-18 08:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @That_Guy8 Every machine I tried Merit on destroyed my VRSC mining.   You might want to check out your CPU use.  If you can - paste this for me to see...

[28-Jul-18 08:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Agama is the wallet that is mining on this machine - goes from 65% CPU use to less than 10%.


[28-Jul-18 08:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Windows Command Processor is the Merit Miner with ZERO cores


[28-Jul-18 08:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Anyone who assumes that Meritminer does not use CPU because it is a GPU miner needs to check these things out for themselves.


[28-Jul-18 08:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <That_Guy8> @jimboscott currently not home but it only really impacts me maybe 20MHs on verus max. What CPUs are you running


[28-Jul-18 08:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <That_Guy8> But yeah I wouldn‚Äôt sacrifice much more verus hash‚Äôs for merit üòâ


[28-Jul-18 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I am running i7's on the machines that I tried this on.


[28-Jul-18 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I would look very closely.  The Agama Wallet hash rate is averaged over a long period of time.  If you ran at 200 mh/s and then started giving another app 80% of the CPU it would take many hours for that to be completely reflected in the wallet=reported hash rate.


[28-Jul-18 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> As an example - I have not been mining VRSC on this machine for a while (it is a slower i7).  So for more than 24 hours it said 0 mh/s.   I just turned mining on about 30 minutes ago and the reported hash rate now says 2.094 mh/s.   It will continue to creep up and then stall around 45.  This is an old Sandy Bridge 4 core i7.  My Kaby Lake i'7s do more like 200 - 230.


[28-Jul-18 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> BTW, I have tried MRT GPU mining on all of my rigs along with VRSC.  They all pretty much do the same thing with VRSC - come to a grinding halt.


[28-Jul-18 09:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <That_Guy8> Good to warn people though. As I said I wouldn‚Äôt sacrifice verus hashrate üòÉ


[28-Jul-18 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> @That_Guy8  and @jimboscott  thanks for all the info provided, it made me take a deeper look at my rig setup, e,g. Was my nice hash miner impacting my verus coin cpu mining, after i monitored my task manager for a good while it seems that nice hash doesn‚Äôt impact my verus cpu mining- iv got 2 threads running on a quad core cpu so only want to use half the cpu power and it more often than not stays at around 54% cpu usage, then only mining on the gpu‚Äôs on nice hash my cpu usage for nice hash is between 1%-3% max , I‚Äôm happy with the balance i have found mining 2 different coins at the same time on the same system, like i said before when i try the same thing with minergate instead of nice hash my cpu usage for minergate goes up well past 70% so i wouldn‚Äôt be able to mine verus as effectively as i am now,


[28-Jul-18 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <That_Guy8> @stretcher83 good to hear man yeah make verus a priority üòâ and mining on the side this is the coin to have üòÉ


[28-Jul-18 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> A good debate is always healthy and can be rewarding

[28-Jul-18 09:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <That_Guy8> I‚Äôd strongly suggest when you can moving from nicehash to direct mining to pools. Nicehash is a rip-off üòõ


[28-Jul-18 09:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <That_Guy8> In my opinion anyways üòÉ


[28-Jul-18 09:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> üòÅ my next one is mining pool hub just not got round to it yet


[28-Jul-18 09:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Iv heard alot about nice hash skimming


[28-Jul-18 09:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> You never know we could get a verus gpu miner in the future and i would move all my hash rate over to there üòÅüëçüèº


[28-Jul-18 09:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Don't know... it's been what... about 2.5 months and nobody has come up with a GPU miner yet...


[28-Jul-18 10:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Maybe it hashes so fast on CPU nobody cares to.


[28-Jul-18 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> If verus coin ends up going up in price alot in the future i dont think other miners will take long to emerge , people are so clever and driven , hek i didnt even think these sort of hash rates where possible for cpu‚Äôs


[28-Jul-18 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <That_Guy8> I think the aim is to keep it CPU only?


[28-Jul-18 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <That_Guy8> There is a GPU in progress but it‚Äôs inefficient and sticking to not wiping out CPUs


[28-Jul-18 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <That_Guy8> From my understanding.


[28-Jul-18 10:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Im looking forward to it what ever happens cpu only or gpu,s


[28-Jul-18 10:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> We will try to get GPU mining ready to use alongside CPU mining soon, but we believe CPUs will be the fastest for some time


[28-Jul-18 10:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Isnt a asic just a processor I mean like multiple processors , i dont fully understand them but thats sort of the jist   I get


[28-Jul-18 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I dont want asics on verus just like the rest of us i just think nothing is impossible unfortunately


[28-Jul-18 10:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I would rather have cpu and gpu over asic all day long


[28-Jul-18 10:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <That_Guy8> Sorta yeah but only good for 1 task and that is all.


[28-Jul-18 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <That_Guy8> FPGA is like a baby version of an asic. Less power but can reprogram to do other tasks.


[28-Jul-18 10:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Yeh so like you can emulate cores or whatever you need to get your programs working


[28-Jul-18 10:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Can a fpga fool the verus wallet into using cores emulated cores on it


[28-Jul-18 10:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <That_Guy8> If someone could write the code it could I guess.


[28-Jul-18 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <That_Guy8> I know nothing of coding though


[28-Jul-18 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <That_Guy8> So take what I say as speculation in that area üòõ


[28-Jul-18 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Yeh iv read them fpga are very hard to program


[28-Jul-18 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <That_Guy8> Have you looked at the acorn FPGAs


[28-Jul-18 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763

[28-Jul-18 10:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Only done light research , im interested in most things crypto


[28-Jul-18 10:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> We have someone who can program FPGAs, and when @OhGodAPet was talking about his FPGA, we looked into it and concluded that we couldn't make an FPGA program for the community that would provide good perf at any reasonable price. The challenge is that the CPU instructions we leverage are extremely integrated and effectively like ASICs in the CPU, and the only way to make up for that is extreme parallelism, which starts to get quite expensive. We can certainly revisit the question anytime, and if anyone believes there's an FPGA that poses a threat to CPU mining, we'd be happy to look into it and make something competitive available. Right now, it doesn't seem like a worthwhile option.
Regarding GPUs, there is a dev who has been working on that and doing his best to optimize it. They are seeing between 120 and 140 MH/s on the hash algorithm on a 1080ti. Since the CPU is so fast, there's also the issue of simply moving memory to and from the CPU, which has fixed overhead that is actually substantial. That makes using a riser drop the performance immediately into the 20 - 30 MH/s range. While I haven't looked into the code myself, we believe this overhead is why we haven't been able to get linear increase in GPU performance with more cards as well.

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> So how often do you guys find blocks? I have been running the wallet all day and am at 80mhs. Also when you hit a block what is the reward for this coin?


[28-Jul-18 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> Haven't been mining lately because of the heat


[28-Jul-18 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> What's new


[28-Jul-18 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> Are we no longer timelocked?


[28-Jul-18 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @Godballz 80mh is going to take days to find a block.  Probably 5 to 6 days.  The reward right now is 192 but in a tad more than 4 hours that is going to halve... 96.


[28-Jul-18 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Oh damn. So not really worth running my i7 for a week for 96 coins unless these coins are going for like .50c EA? How is this coin profitable?


[28-Jul-18 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Is this geared toward xeons? Sorry I'm just wondering if I should keep up with mining this. I like the idea of the coin but does it make more sense to just trade through exchanges?


[28-Jul-18 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Or I think I read something on here about pool mining. Is this something that may happen soon?


[28-Jul-18 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lucivere> When the halving occurs in a few hrs, all coins you get from then on will be non-timelocked. So you can stake them and make em work for you. Or you can sell them if you‚Äôd prefer that.


[28-Jul-18 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @Godballz well, right now in thinly traded conditions it is selling for around 12k to 20k sats - that's .98 to 1.64 usd


[28-Jul-18 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> And yes... pool mining should start soon after the non-locked block rewards start ... less than 3 hours from now.


[28-Jul-18 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763

[28-Jul-18 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <superbig> Is there a new wallet?


[28-Jul-18 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> 0.3.11 is the current version. you should upgrade before the halving if you haven't already, as it improves the PoS resistance to attack and is a required upgrade at halving


[28-Jul-18 07:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @dukeleto Probably just a matter of time I would think.


[28-Jul-18 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Sorry what does it mean to stake coins and have them work for you? Also what is the reward for finding a block


[28-Jul-18 08:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lucivere> I believe we just went through the next halving, which means the reward is now 96 coins.


[28-Jul-18 08:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lucivere> Look at #staking  to see more info on what staking is:)

[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @Godballz Staking is an incentive to those who have coins to keep their wallets and connections open in support of the network.  It is a bit like mining as far as luck and probability go, but instead of leveraging computational power in an effort to achieve a consensus on a transaction, coins are leveraged.


[28-Jul-18 10:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Oh ok thank you

[dscrdvrsc] <oscar> can I use the same wallet.dat in two cpmputers?


[29-Jul-18 01:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <oscar> just mining together


[29-Jul-18 01:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <sethmw> you can, but I'm not that familiar with how. I believe they discuss how to do that in the redit faqs


[29-Jul-18 01:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <oscar> ok,


[29-Jul-18 01:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <thedon> So now evey coin i mine is instently mature and i can move it or use for staking , right ? Just making sure..


[29-Jul-18 01:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <sethmw> yep, just move to a private z address from shielded coinbase and back to your transparent address and its staking


[29-Jul-18 01:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <oscar> I have staking before,but when I send some coins out ,then staking is over


[29-Jul-18 01:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <LOUD Mining> @oscar anytime you make a transaction with your wallet, POS stops and you have to restart to continue staking available coins. At least that's what I understand about POS wallets.


[29-Jul-18 01:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <LOUD Mining> Correct me if I'm wrong here anyone...


[29-Jul-18 01:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @LOUD Mining actually, that's not the case with Verus


[29-Jul-18 01:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the only coins that stop staking are the ones from the source transaction for the new transaction, because their age gets reset and they need to wait another 150 blocks


[29-Jul-18 01:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <oscar> alright


[29-Jul-18 05:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blancodiablo> how do we know how long the maturation is for the new 96 coin blocks?


[29-Jul-18 05:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mavenL> just 100 blocks till it mature


[29-Jul-18 05:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blancodiablo> cool. thanks


[29-Jul-18 07:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> If something pops up under mining saying type: public direction: immature amount: 96 etc does that mean a block is found?

[29-Jul-18 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <iO_User> Just glad we had a small increase in hashrate, it's the perfect balance. 

I think the 2 worst case scenarios would have been a massive increase (so we all get less rewards), or no increase (indicating a lack of interest). 

However it may be that those mining now are just the existing community, but just put more hashpower on. 

But I'm optimistic with time and through spreading the word, people will start to understand the value of this coin and help us grow.

[dscrdvrsc] <englal> @garnettfan The coinbases (block rewards) can only be spent to a private address in an action called "shielding" you need to shield the coins, then you can use them as any other coins, such as sending them to a private address to stake with.

If you're using Agama there's an option in the send interface (might only show up after you select private tx, I can't remember as I only really use CLI) to shield coinbases.

If you're using CLI you need to use the z_shieldcoinbase command.

[30-Jul-18 04:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Personally i still think that 15mh is too slow

[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @Andstar I want to know how you are able to put those five words together... 'all the blocks I've found'.   I am hashing with 1.7 Gh/s and have not found anything in about 30 hours.

[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Or were you just sort of assuming you had been finding blocks while using the wrong pubkey?


[30-Jul-18 06:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Welcome @Faisal


[30-Jul-18 06:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> #cpu-hashrate is only for inputting your cpu specs and your hash rate for verus, looking forward to seeing what you have got


[30-Jul-18 10:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> That does seem a little low.  I‚Äôve tried 1,2 and 4 threads all with same result


[30-Jul-18 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Can you bring up a cpu monitor on your desktop so you can get a rough idea whats getting used by the cpu


[30-Jul-18 10:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Im on windows 10 and the task manager does an ok job displaying the cpu usage, i know windows 7 task manager is not as good


[30-Jul-18 10:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> You can also check the processes thats using the cpu,


[30-Jul-18 10:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> There was a instance on here the other day when i got told certain programs can slow your verus mining down


[30-Jul-18 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> For an example , if i use minergate for mining ethereum only on gpu, it actually uses like 70% of my cpu aswell, even though i didnt start the cpu mining, because of that my verus mining would slow down alot


[30-Jul-18 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> On the other hand im mining ethereum on nice hash, gpu only and it dosnt touch my cpu- only about 3% cpu usage , so im ok mining verus on my cpu without nice hash slowing it down


[30-Jul-18 11:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Maybe you have got a program your using thats doing a similar thing

Is there a resource that has the current time locked coins listed? Obviously maturities will vary but just curious how much of the 27M is unavailable


[30-Jul-18 06:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mylo(KomodoPioneers)> from the #faq-chosen in verus discord.
Rewards >=192 are time locked.  so about 26 million time locked.  And no you can't see them because only the miner knows the transaction data.
```
Block Reward
1 week smooth linear ramp from 0 to 384, then halving every month (43,200 blocks)
1st week:  Block 1 -> 10080 = 1,935,360 VRSC
1st month: Block 10080 -> 53280 = 384 VRSC = 16,588,800 VRSC
2nd month: Block 53280 -> 96480 = 192 VRSC = 8,294,400 VRSC
3rd month: Block 96480 -> 139680 = 96 VRSC = 4,147,200 VRSC
4th month: Block 139680 -> 182880 = 48 VRSC = 2,073,600 VRSC
5th month: Block 182880 -> 226080 = 24 VRSC = 1,036,800 VRSC
Block 226080 onward for another 2 years = 24 VRSC
```

[30-Jul-18 06:10 PM] bishop#9773

yeah about 700k probably stakeable atm (yep i realised the channel), so i joined you in komodo glory üòÉ

good to see the math isn't that far off


[30-Jul-18 06:12 PM] bishop#9773
given current block height


[30-Jul-18 06:12 PM] bishop#9773
and absent all random time locks that have yet to free up


[30-Jul-18 06:12 PM] Mylo#8306
it was ~480k when 96 block reward started.

[dscrdvrsc] <Cam - [triforce]> Is there a reasonable reason that a mac downloads the blockchain 5x faster?  I installed 0.3.11 on both machines at the same time, and got them both started within about 30 miinutes of each other.  The mac had the blockchain in 3 hours, the Win10 machine took 16+


[30-Jul-18 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cam - [triforce]> and now on my Win10 laptop it's been going for 3.5 hours and is at 16%


[30-Jul-18 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Cam - [triforce] Windows is historically slow on the networking side in Komodo, and I guess Zcash and possibly Bitcoin. I haven't looked deeply into it, but the original Agama even has a workaround to limit the number of connections just on Windows when synching, which speeds up networking as well.


[30-Jul-18 10:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> I would recommend ubuntu , I was using windows before. It is pretty user friendly.


[30-Jul-18 10:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Andstar> @jimboscott your screenshot shows you have found 2 blocks is that not correct?


[30-Jul-18 10:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <kezz> anyone familiar with komodo that can explain to me how holding in the agama wallet generates 5% interest?


[30-Jul-18 11:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Andstar> The main question is, what happens when you mine to your address and not public key?


[30-Jul-18 11:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> On Komodo, it's actually just a rule of the Komodo blockchain that all nodes can calculate and add the same way when making a transaction. the wallet does not need to be running, as it is not staking in the sense that it does not validate blocks. it is a function of the UTXO age and size.

[dscrdvrsc] <Zorgs> @oscar Got to start somewhere, fact is we need AN exchange haha. There's plenty of other community voted exchanges we can get into, the more this occurs the more chance we have of getting onto bigger exchanges. Also with a better community the more chance we can get listed on some exchanges without paying for the privledge.

[01-Aug-18 02:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mk111> to upgrade from v0.3.9 to v0.3.11 can i just download and v0.3.11 and unzip it. then run agama.exe from the v0.3.11 folder ?


[01-Aug-18 02:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> @mk111 I believe you need to delete all the files in VRSC folder (user/AppData/Roaming/Komodo/VRSC) except wallet.dat, to download the correct chain, but remember to take a backup of your wallet.dat file first!! The old 0.3.9 folder is best to delete after, to make sure you dont start your own fork again by accident.

[dscrdvrsc] <silkspinner> @bluemagestrut  The linux cli version of Verus is just  a tar file you can extract where ever it is convenient for execution. The important file, your wallet.dat, will always be found in //home/(username)/.komodo/VRSC folder regardless of where your verus-cli executables live.

[01-Aug-18 10:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> @AkiraX . with 313mh at current hash yu should get a block every 4.6 days!


[01-Aug-18 10:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> actually scratch that.. net hash just jumped to 2.4Th. You now should get a block every 5.1 days..


[01-Aug-18 10:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> by may calc.. taking into acount everything.. POW, unlocked rewards to POS , the hash rate bump, etc... 
This 96 reward phase so far, is about  25% as profitable as the 192 phase.   << SO FAR.

[02-Aug-18 07:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> @yitiaochong  go to the veruscoin web site.  Veruscoin.io


[02-Aug-18 07:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Latest version is on there. 0.3.11 beta üëçüèº


[02-Aug-18 08:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <yitiaochong> It's so slow to download on the website


[02-Aug-18 08:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Really , it only took me about 5-10 mins to download the agama wallet from the veruscoin website, not even that long, it takes a bit longer downloading the blockchain , between 10 mins to 1 hour but not really much longer than that


[02-Aug-18 08:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Is it taking you long to download the agama exe from veruscoin site or is it taking long to download and sync with the block chain


[02-Aug-18 08:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Im not sure on the rules of discord , weather i can post the downloaded exe file from my end on these chats  for you , to be honest iv never had any issues with downloading it from the website, maybe your internet is playing up , try a router restart üëçüèº

[02-Aug-18 12:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Eightynine> @stretcher83 Hey as you can see I'm trying to get some information about this coin.


[02-Aug-18 12:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> You can exchange it if you want on digitalprice.io but i would hold on to whatever you get because you can also stake your coins to earn more coins and help the network at the same time


[02-Aug-18 12:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Read every thing you can on this discord and then see what you want do, you will learn more by reading the facts to yourself instead of taking my word for it i mean i might explain it in a way you dont understand me/ my interpretation might be different than yours,


[02-Aug-18 12:09 PM] Gateway#3763

[02-Aug-18 12:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Its more than that, its pow, pos and thers another proof of something coming , i forget what its called


[02-Aug-18 12:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Just to let you know, this is one of the coins im holding for the future, not looking at exchanging any verus , maybe if i get absolute shitloads but i carnt see that happening right now, im on 61mh/s across 2 pc‚Äôs üëçüèº

[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Now that each block I get ends up making at least three transactions, I will soon run over what I have heard is a 300 transaction limit for viewing history with the Agama wallet...  how does one look at the entire history when over that limit?

[02-Aug-18 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> @stretcher83 The thing that is slow is the blockchain download.  I am worried about anyone starting to mine VRSC after another 6 months. Might take an hour or more.


[02-Aug-18 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Alright> Is that someone burning coins accidentally? Shouldn't the difference of inputs and outputs go to the miner?


[02-Aug-18 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @bigtom do you have a very large wallet? i will definitely be looking at download speed


[02-Aug-18 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> @miketout This is separate from the wallet sync. The time consuming thing I have seen is the blockchain download on a new wallet install.  I think it was over 2GB.  At least that was the network received total after it was done on a fresh install.


[02-Aug-18 06:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> understood, that is the wallet sync I'm referring to


[02-Aug-18 06:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> Ok. I thought you meant the sync when an existing wallet.dat does a sync with a new wallet install.


[02-Aug-18 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Alright> @miketout could you explain what's happening in that block please?


[02-Aug-18 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Alright> what's up with these txs that have no vouts at all. Are they burning the inputs?


[02-Aug-18 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> looks like a shielding transaction to me. input from a coinbase, output to z-address, so you can no longer see amount or address destination


[02-Aug-18 07:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Alright> txs don't show any joinsplits


[02-Aug-18 07:53 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Alright> Hmmm maybe it's a bug in `getrawtransaction`?


[02-Aug-18 08:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gamer278> I need help. I wrote to the support email of safex but never received a response. 2 days ago I purchased coins from the safex website. I sent btc from my coinbase account to the address the website provided. I also provided my safex wallet address for the coins to be deposited in. According the the btc transaction number it went thru. The coins never made it into my wallet. Can any admin help me.


[02-Aug-18 08:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we don't have anything to do with safex. did you mean to post this here in Verus Coin discord?


[02-Aug-18 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Alright interesting. i haven't ever worked in that code, and all the ways I normally get that information work. i've tried it on the current version and also a version I have with all the latest Komodo changes integrated and don't see the joinsplits on either. do you get that info on private transactions on Komodo?


[02-Aug-18 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Alright> Hmm looking at it now, I swear I thought getrawtransaction then decoderawtransaction would show joinsplits on other chain


[02-Aug-18 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Alright> I just tested it on a KMD asset chain, and it doesn't show them

[02-Aug-18 09:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> when they followed these instructions, problem went away. likely something local is corrupted that triggers a resynch but does not get fixed.
Backup your wallet.dat file from the VRSC directory (just to be safe). The following locations are for Windows and Linux:
Windows: <system drive>\Users<user name>\AppData\Roaming\Komodo\VRSC on Linux: ~/.komodo/VRSC
Delete everything in that VRSC directory, except wallet.dat
Load and resync, and you should be fine.


[02-Aug-18 09:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> just do it manually once, and it should stop


[02-Aug-18 09:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <nimabi> I just deleted that VRSC directory


[02-Aug-18 09:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <nimabi> the same


[02-Aug-18 09:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <nimabi> and re sync


[02-Aug-18 09:15 PM] Gateway#3763

[02-Aug-18 09:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> something is wrong with the install in some way. what version of Windows? is there anything you can tell me about these machines that might be different? you have it on all and I haven't heard this without being fixable even once.

[03-Aug-18 07:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> @cip pas At the current nethash you would have to wait about 2 months, on average. And the nethash then needs to stay the same.


[03-Aug-18 07:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> But you can get lucky and have one the first day, or you might go 6 months without anything.


[03-Aug-18 07:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> One of my i5 laptops got a block after 2 days, with only 37MH/s. But one i7 with 154MH/s has gone 10 days without anything. Luck is a big deal when mining solo with low hashrate.

[03-Aug-18 10:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Doe> Was just noticing a non-avx cpu question from yesterday. I thought non-avx cpus were not supported by the mining wallet ? Info from main website says System requirements: 64bit CPU/OS, CPU with AES-NI and AVX instructions. I have a couple old core 2 duo laptops which I would really like to try with Verus, but I know they are SSE2 cpus which have mined other coins ( at a very low hashrate ). Does SSE2 or any non-avx cpu have the right specifications to mine Verus, or maybe in the future those could be compatible ? My AVX cpu speed increased 250 times with Verus. 300 h/s to 75 mh/s. Those sse2 cpus would probably also get a huge h/s increase. Something like 5 - 10 mh/s rather than 35 h/s.


[03-Aug-18 10:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we support non-AVX wallets on Linux and Mac. Windows is working and we will get it out after a little more testing


[03-Aug-18 10:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Doe> Thats great ! Thanks, will give it a whirl.


[03-Aug-18 11:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> if you're thinking about mining, it won't be fast, but staking is fine


[03-Aug-18 11:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Doe> So to activate staking...... I would need to have funds in the wallet that can be moved, and then send to z shield address if its mined. Send back to transparent address so it can be accessed ? Option 2.... send from another wallet or buy. Is that right ? Just reading the wallet guide. Also, how would the staking rewards be calculated ? Like if I had 1000 VerusCoin staking for 1 month. Is there a way of getting a rough estimate ?


[03-Aug-18 11:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> that is correct. staking is like mining. a statistical contest of all staking transactions trying to beat a difficulty, weighted by the size of each transaction


[03-Aug-18 11:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Doe> Ahh i see. So any calculations depend on my % in relation to the network.


[03-Aug-18 11:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> right


[03-Aug-18 11:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Doe> Only 64 bit systems will work and not 32 bit ? I would be tempted to try on an old Pentium 4 Hyperthreading cpu = D But its 32 bit.

[04-Aug-18 10:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <wistar> @Private Ryan : I had that error once but when I carefully re-copied and pasted the destination address it worked without error.


[04-Aug-18 12:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <silkspinner> @Shaun  I had that exact error, twice, one block of coins  would not send because of  different anchor. I found that if I sent 1 more coin to that address from a different account, that would seem to overwrite the anchor info and I could send all coins out.


[04-Aug-18 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Shaun , I would try @silkspinner ‚Äòs suggestion. My guess is that there is an issue in the wallet store or in the wallet forming the tx, which I will look at. Do you have multiple z-addresses?


[04-Aug-18 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Shaun> solved! ,i sent some coin from my friend's wallet to my z-addressÔºåafter that ,i re-send my coin from this  z-address to my t-addressÔºåit works well

[dscrdvrsc] <UncleRay> @miketout  thanks


[04-Aug-18 10:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <UncleRay> is this a cpu only coin?


[04-Aug-18 10:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> for now CPU only. i believe we will soon have GPU miners that are in development. currently they don't look like they will be better than CPUs or support many GPUs in one machine due to bottlenecks. check #cpu-hashrate for CPU numbers to get a feel for CPU speeds, which are the highest in the world on any cryptographic hash algorithm. what I understand is that the GPU numbers are under 140 MH/s for a 1080ti and drop significantly with multiple cards or go into the low 10s of MH/s with risers

[dscrdvrsc] <devpro> @miketout   Is there another exchange?


[04-Aug-18 11:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> not yet. we can work to get on additional exchanges if the community wants to, but the big ones can take a little time. i think digitalprice.io has done a good job for the community so far. i haven't heard many complaints, and those that i did were resolved. imo, additional exchanges should either bring an audience to learn about Verus, which means being a little bigger, or i'm not sure if they help a lot. if the community wants to get on more, we certainly can focus more on that

[05-Aug-18 01:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Asher> @garnettfan You can add the following line to your VRSC.conf:
maxconnections="number of connections without quotes"


[05-Aug-18 04:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <oscar> strange,I add maxconnections=500,but restart wallet connect sill 8.

[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> how to run a full node to benefit the network?


[05-Aug-18 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> all you need is a public IP and to run a node


[05-Aug-18 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> if you have that and set maxconnections=500 in your VRSC.conf, you will see more than 8 connections, and you will be helping the network


[05-Aug-18 11:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <That_Guy8> Is there somewhere you need to set the public ip in settings or config?


[05-Aug-18 11:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <That_Guy8> or a port to forward?


[05-Aug-18 11:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> I have gigabit fibre, will try  1000 connections. Activated DMZ for the IP, connections are increasing indeed. Port range access would be better than DMZ, which ports should be open for public?


[05-Aug-18 11:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> only 27485 is needed


[05-Aug-18 11:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> a little over 800 is the limit right now that you will get


[05-Aug-18 11:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> o'right let's hope more ppl with public ip and some solid net connection could just add the port forward on their routers, that would probably fix connection issues for the network üòÉ Thanks Mike!


[05-Aug-18 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <VirtualSoundNW> Opened my cloud linux VM port and upped the limit in ~/.komodo/VRSC/VRSC.conf to maxconnections=500. It's now creeping up in the upper teens. Try

I get 19 now.


[05-Aug-18 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <wistar> Weird. I have seen as high as 30 connections on one of my machines in recent weeks. Pretty darn sure I had no public IP going especially as it is behind a gateway with a non-static IP address. Maybe I was hallucinating?

[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> network hashrate is crashing???
Network (GH/s)

[05-Aug-18 09:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> The hashrate is down the diffuculty is super high.


[05-Aug-18 09:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> ya but that was a huge drop from where it was.. its already doubled since i wrote that..


[05-Aug-18 09:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> some sort of ripple in the matrix


[05-Aug-18 10:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> hash rate and difficulty are part of the same calculation, basically, hash rate is calculated from difficulty. i just finished putting all the code needed for VerusHash support into nheqminer, which is a stratum miner that can also mine Komodo and Zcash with CPU or GPU. I think once we have pools running with this, we should get a significantly larger hashrate and stronger network


[05-Aug-18 11:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> @miketout . with some of the locked coins being 2 years and beyond, how are those trnsactions not going to just get burried or lost off the end of the wallet trnsactions? There will be no way of keeping track and seeing when things come mature.


[05-Aug-18 11:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we are going to make the list able to be much longer


[05-Aug-18 11:02 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> So a GPU miner is being released as well as a cpu miner?


[06-Aug-18 01:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> @Godballz Some people are working on a GPU miner. Release date is unknown.


[06-Aug-18 01:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Godballz the GPU mining work does not currently beat CPU mining. in tests, they are getting under 140 MH/s on a 1080ti, and risers slow it a lot. the pool miner that I've just written from a fork of nheqminer is benchmarking a bit faster than the wallet on CPU, but there's no GPU support in it yet. I don't know the exact release date of the GPU miner, but I know they are trying to finish soon as well. I'd like to see someone put the GPU support into the nheqminer fork, so people can use both with pools. CPUs are still tops right now, but it looks like they may be able to coexist.


[06-Aug-18 06:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @Gmoney It would also be great to be able to sort the transactions by the 'time to maturity' so we could bring the next blocks to mature to the top of the list.


[06-Aug-18 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> @jimboscott yes!


[06-Aug-18 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> so something weird this morning.. 
I was right at my computer when a staked transaction was coming in.. 1 confirmation.. 
Then I looked back a minute or 2 later.. It was gone.. I thought I was loosing my mind.. 
Then 2 hours later.. The In and Out reappear and start to recount the confirmations (although the time stamp is still from the 2 hours earlier)
however there is no 'mined' transaction.. 
and there is no balance change.. 
So my staked reward either 1. got sucked into the ether with another glitch in the matrix, or 2. someone else grabbed it???
@miketout thoughts?

[08-Aug-18 02:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo> just want to add 2 more things which are to me equally important and co-related with voting which is identity - identity system, best - decentralized identity system which could buld trust similar to google page rank or so (where replace page with profiles) AND decent forum engine - engine for mass knowledge/information processing (the closest wikipedia was to that, but not exactly)


[08-Aug-18 02:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo> Decentralized identity system + decentralized forum (or actually massive information processing engine = MIPE) + decentralized voting = new democracy

[dscrdvrsc] <anrahu akeba> welcome bro

[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo> actually it would be best if all 3 could be configurable and get from KMD the possibility to create "configurable democratic worlds" same way as KMD allows for creating chains and assets. Just here it would be createion of communities with some pre-config. Both the creators and pre-config + random events would make some communities evolve or die...

[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @hastrup Verus is already available for the Agama wallet, if I am playing Wheel of Fortune well enough...


[08-Aug-18 06:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @devpro There is a trading channel.  There is also an exchange.


[08-Aug-18 07:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <terwenlee> I think Vers is a better project than Bitcoin and other currencies. The only downside is that the current wallet can't be encrypted.


[08-Aug-18 08:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> wallet encryption is incompatible with shielded addresses (zaddrs), so that is an issue for Zcash, Komodo and every Zcash-related coin

[08-Aug-18 12:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo> regarding identity in Verus whipepaper, I quickly jumped through, not sure if I can see there a place for profiles or (any) institutions doing profile verifications in a more open way. What I expect by identity is actually an identity that changes in time, and has time-based properties. Meaning: if someone from the network meet with me in person and confirms my profile photo matches my name and second name with my gov id - it will be differently weight in markin profile as true based on if that happen yesterday or 10 years ago. For example each profile check or even profile check type could have a life time, also specific properties could have a lifetime, and scale linearly to weight 0 at end of life. Also if someone confirms pgoto + name without id it will be differently weight. This way anyone can confirm anyone. Confirmation should send some points based on confirming profile rank. This way in time some institutions or profiles will come up which will charge fees for professional confirmations, and they will have big trust. HEre a penalty must be introduced - if someone cheated/mistaked. So profiles should have many properties regarding confirming profiles itself. This way everyone could be confirmed with his friends on facebook (for example) but much stronger in gov office or in some company doing such service, or even in a bank.


[08-Aug-18 12:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo> Quite a lot of work, part of which will be needed still after implementation and monitoring the system in the wild (to weight in penalties to recognize profile cheaters).


[08-Aug-18 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hastrup> so the komodo agamawallet is no good?


[08-Aug-18 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo> Great if penalties could propagate live, so when a "cheater" is detected (by kind of error-rate?) by system (network = conflicting profile marks in narrows space-time) all previous profile confirmations should be some way cancelled or weight zero? just guessing should work some way like that, but calibration may be hell üòÉ

[08-Aug-18 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @samson People had the wool pulled over their eyes during the 2000 elections.  The notion that a paperless voting system that is NOT 100% verifiable (as a blockchain would be) would be superior to paper is simply wrongheaded.  With paper there IS a record.  With the current system?  Who really knows.

Was the 2000 election a false flag?  Probably not.  But the result would be the same.  A non-verifiable electronic election is subject to all kinds of deception and frankly, it is just a matter of time before such a system is captured and used to keep one party in power indefinitely.  Just like 'digital books', electronic data can be edited on the fly.  Ie., what Wikipedia said in 2015 might bear little in resemblance to the same entry in 2020.

[10-Aug-18 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <wistar> Observation: Win 10 Agama GUI v11. Only my i9 machines get out of sync. Even if I run them slower than my Ryzen 1700s and i7s. Another thing: I can't stop the i9s from mining using the STOP button. _Whether or not the i9 machines are synced_, if I click the STOP button, it will briefly show a grayed-out LOADING button state and then the button-state just goes back to STOP and the machine continues mining & staking. Even if I go to the Verus badge on the left side of the interface and click the three-dot menu and select _STOP_, nothing happens‚Äîit just continues to mine. The only way to stop it is to X out of Agama.

This is not true on any machine other than my i9s. I am beginning to wonder if there isn't a bug specific to machines with greater than 8 physical cores.


[10-Aug-18 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @BTC-BTC-BTC With your hashrate you should average a block per 7,5 days with current hashrate. Having no blocks for 13 days is not that much of a bad luck - but definitely you should find one sooner than later statistically.

Right now, you'll have to build, but I will post a Linux release when we validate it on pools. You can use it to benchmark your CPU with as well, using:

‚Ä¢ Re-start Agama and on the dark-background screen with the Agama logo, click on the upper "Activate Coin" button. 
‚Ä¢ Select Verus in the "select coin" drop down.
‚Ä¢ Then in the lower "daemon parameter" drop-down scroll down and select the "Daemon param: reindexing blocks from disk" and let it do its thing which in my case took a few mins. I can't remember what it does to let you know when it's done but it was intuitive‚Äîeven for a technical moron such as me.

Although the following shows Komodo rather than VRSC this is what you want to do:

seeing the nheqminer for Verus, is there a stratum implementation to VRSC already, too?

[12-Aug-18 11:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @dukeleto will do


[13-Aug-18 12:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <house> hmmm, seems to be only getting 4 connections


[13-Aug-18 12:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <house> for me


[13-Aug-18 12:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it is only getting 4 connections on outgoing, which in this release should be better than 8 was on the last. are you in synch or synching?


[13-Aug-18 12:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <house> in sync


[13-Aug-18 12:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <house> mining hash has improved10-20%


[13-Aug-18 12:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> that's a nice improvement, but this was more about scheduling than a change in the algorithm. the likely reason is simply less overhead and more efficient mining with fewer delays.


[13-Aug-18 12:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> there was no change to the actual mining loop


[13-Aug-18 12:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <house> yes, I'll keep you in the loop if anything happens in nexty hour

[13-Aug-18 04:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @Norain You need to forward ports to your machine first, if you have only 4 connections it means your port is not accessible from outside of your lan


[13-Aug-18 05:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> @house what kind of improvement have you seen with staking? I have seemed to be lacking in my staking returns lately... hoping this update changes things 

maybe you have been lucky due to early-ish upgrade?


[13-Aug-18 05:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <house> @ver_User nno ... nothing extra with the upgrade
Seems that if you divide the verus between say 7 addresses ... minimum 1500 each address ... up to about 3000 ... you get more blocks


[13-Aug-18 05:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <house> least that works for me


[13-Aug-18 05:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> ah ok


[13-Aug-18 05:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> minimum 1500? I have been reading that maximum 700-1000 is a good strategy for transaction sizes? how large are the transactions in your addresses?


[13-Aug-18 05:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> @house


[13-Aug-18 05:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <house> they vary


[13-Aug-18 05:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <house> 6 blocks is not uncommon (per day)


[13-Aug-18 05:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> ok, yeah I have a range too, just having vagely read some advice about maximum transactions sizes when I move them I try to keep them at 700


[13-Aug-18 05:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> I'll try different addresses but not sure if that will just add time costs - having to shield from multiple addresses will be a pain (until I set up auto staking)


[13-Aug-18 05:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <house> actually, its not so bad


[13-Aug-18 05:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> All you do to update agama is, first make a backup of your wallet.dat file, located at %appdata% folder on windows, the roaming folder contains the komodo folder, in there you go to vrsc folder and in there you will find your wallet.dat file, just make a backup copy of it, keep it safe,
After that, close the %appdata% folder and go to your agama wallet and stop mining and close the wallet,completely.
Then go to veruscoin.io website and download the newest version of the wallet, for gui its 0,3,12,  when its finished downloading, extract it to a folder called agama 0,3,12 that you can create and place where ever you like, i chose my desktop,once its extracted you go to your antivirus and add an exemption for the new agama 0,3,12 folder you just created ,
Now you should be ok to start the new agama 0,3,12 wallet, no need to click activate coin, just the usual in the native mode box , choose vrsc and it should start to sync back up to the block chain and your block or blocks should show up @Eightynine üëçüèº


[13-Aug-18 05:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> yeah this bloody exclusion... I had to restart my computer after it was "disinfected"


[13-Aug-18 05:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> I decided to remove komodo folder too and start fresh as I wasn't sure how much as been changed - waiting for sync is a pain though, ooops


[13-Aug-18 05:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <house> Note: I accidently updated with the new version over the top of the old version (on one computer) and everything went fine


[13-Aug-18 05:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> yeah I was being cautious due to previously not updating correctly to 311


[13-Aug-18 06:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> To be honest i keep hearing the only file you need to back up is the wallet.dat file, but i also tend to air on the side of caution, i backup both the agama folder and the komodo folder thats in %appdata% folder, i dont move them or change them in any way , and iv had no problems updating before,


[13-Aug-18 06:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I do understand backing up the whole 2 folders i mentioned is a little over kill and growing in mb size every week, but it makes me feel better some how üòé


[13-Aug-18 06:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Forgot to mention , i also delete the remaining old agama 0,3,11 folder from my desktop so i dont get confused and start that one by mistake , just keep the newest agama 0,3,12 folder on your desktop or place of choice


[13-Aug-18 07:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Norain> what port for VRSC ?


[13-Aug-18 07:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Norain> @ok88


[13-Aug-18 07:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @Norain 27485


[13-Aug-18 07:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Norain> Error reading configuration file: the options configuration file contains an invalid line '50'


[13-Aug-18 07:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Norain> i add


[13-Aug-18 07:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Norain> maxconnections=
50


[13-Aug-18 07:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> What file did you add the line to? You should add it to VRSC.conf and actually it is no longer required as the default connection has been increased with 0.3.12 to 384 which seems more than enough to be synced.


[13-Aug-18 07:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Norain> ok i will try


[13-Aug-18 07:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> yeah my sync after making a new komodo folder has been ridiculously slow (15% in nearly 2 hours), so I've re-launched with the old backup, seems fine


[13-Aug-18 09:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @house Depends upon how many coins you have.  So... how many mature and transparent coins do you have staking?  If you get 5 blocks per day from staking I am going with 15-18K


[13-Aug-18 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @Norain it must be all on one line, no linebreak, i.e. `maxconnections=50`


[13-Aug-18 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @dukeleto Could I have screwed something up when I started using 0.3.12?   I just copied all the new files over the old files.


[13-Aug-18 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Everything looks right, but immediately I hit a brick wall.


[13-Aug-18 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <house> yes @jimboscott  I had about 18k


[13-Aug-18 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <wistar> @jimboscott: I spent much of the day upgrading to .12 and seem to be getting blocks about the same as before. I did notice one odd thing: syncing .12 took _much_ longer on my 16-core machines than on my i7s and Ryzen 1700s. The latter synced almost instantly whereas the i9s, etc., took 5-10 minutes.


[13-Aug-18 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I have gone 30 hours with nothing at all.  Was getting 3-4/day.

[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Can‚Äôt reply in announcements, but I‚Äôve never heard of bitexbay, can‚Äôt say I‚Äôd ever use them


[14-Aug-18 01:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Fly by night exchanges are sketchy as hell


[14-Aug-18 01:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> We should not pay for being listed on exchechges like that I believe, this is not a prominent exchange and they should list coins for free, they get their share of fees anyway


[14-Aug-18 01:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> And getting exposed to exchanges when nothing but a live blockchain is up - is a bad move I believe. We have noting on top of the ledger at the moment, this is a phase where ledger is getting transaction volume and just getting fully operational. We don't need speculators and investors at this point of developement.


[14-Aug-18 01:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <anrahu akeba> anyone heard of gate.io


[14-Aug-18 01:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <anrahu akeba> free


[14-Aug-18 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <riesbree> Never heard of this exchange. Is it not possible to use an exchange that is allready known by blockfolio?


[14-Aug-18 02:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> We have a less known exchange available, if we want exchanges we should aim at big ones and only after anything would be built on top of the ledger, at the moment we have nothing but idea and ledger! Why even bother with listings, we need developments not exchanges.


[14-Aug-18 02:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ted> we need both developments and exchanges.


[14-Aug-18 02:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> Explain to me why would we need more exchanges, because I don't get it. We have BarterDEX and DigitalPrice


[14-Aug-18 02:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ted> more exchanges can take more people to know this project.


[14-Aug-18 02:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ted> more people join this project.


[14-Aug-18 02:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> There are better ways for marketing than listings and as long as there is no pool, no one-click miner and no apps using the ledger there is little to promote with exchanges alone, especially if those exchanges would be little known ones.


[14-Aug-18 02:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ted> yes,but we can do these at the same time


[14-Aug-18 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> A pool is getting tested again , looks promising, #pools


[14-Aug-18 03:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> I agree. We can't just say we are Verus, a Komodo fork, accept us on the big exchanges


[14-Aug-18 03:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> Can we write articles on Medium?


[14-Aug-18 03:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <themobi> There‚Äôs one Medium article yesterday


[14-Aug-18 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> @themobi Nice.. I need to read it


[14-Aug-18 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> Maybe a faucet or something where people are interacting with the project & installing the app for a very small amount crypto


[14-Aug-18 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> app--meant wallet


[14-Aug-18 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> You might remember--3 coins forked in January, I think.. Bitcoin Private, Bitcoin Hush & I think one more.. But Bitcoin Hush, I thought would be very popular.. I'm not sure it's even on CMC.. I'm not saying anything bad about the project, I liked it. BUT--it is important to get on a few exchanges.  CryptoBridge, HyperDEX & try for Cryptopia


[14-Aug-18 04:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <riesbree> Coinexchange.io  maybe?


[14-Aug-18 06:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> @riesbree I just don't think we realize what it costs, you and I, because I bet it's outrageous


[14-Aug-18 06:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> Maybe they could keep the money, hire a Dev & get a DEX together


[14-Aug-18 06:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> Look at NEO & Aphelion, for example


[14-Aug-18 06:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <riesbree> I really have no idea what the costs are.


[14-Aug-18 06:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> Hundreds of thousands im sure


[14-Aug-18 06:07 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> Centralized exchanges have absorbed a good portion of money that should've stayed in crypto


[14-Aug-18 06:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <riesbree> I do think it helps to grow i you have an exchange which is better know then the one there is now. But the questions is it worth the costs.

[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> Well it's necessary for exposure and growth.. But we are moving into decentralized exchange era


[14-Aug-18 06:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> Personally, I believe that money could help actually pay professionals, Dev teams, something--maybe nothing crazy... But we can't copy the corporate structure that got us here .. one man on top, with most.. and everyone else, none

[14-Aug-18 07:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoAlex> @Crypto80 I bet DEX will be adopted when you can use them as a web app connect to a smartphone (like whatsapp). My hipotesis is that people are not used to download trading software on their PC and that they want to have the flexibility that web applications give them, but are really ok with downloading apps on their phones or needing them for access their trading web plataforms (2FA). As it seems, Q1/Q2 2019 seems to be the start of this trend, but maybe paying for listing has a short term benefit. Anyway, I belive the bullet points to discuss on the listing matter are:
1. When DEX model will gain traction?
2. How long the foundation can wait before starting selling their VRSC funds? 
3. How much money will be needed each month?
4. What is the expected impact in volume and price after the listing on the candidates exchanges?
5. How much will the listing cost on each exchange?
6. Is there any alternative for increasing the value and volume? 
7. Is there any alternative for listing instead of paying?

[15-Aug-18 05:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> About the exchange  - I would think targeting one major exchange is the way to go, but I too do not know the costs. If we end up spread out over lots of little ones it will hinder price discovery as I think the Verus market would be too spread out and illiquid, and it would be an inefficient use of time/resources to get them set up.

Unless people really want to buy Verus, it's unlikely they will go and sign up to yet another (relatively unproven/untested/unknown) exchange when most traders already have to manage accounts for multiple exchanges already. People in general favour the easy route most of the time, especially nowadays with everything already done/predicted/saved for you online. I think being on digiprice is fine for now as we are so small and anyone who wants in will sign up. The same goes for many others IMO - you might get some of the existing userbase to take a look on different exchanges but to really get market participation you need to be where the market is, not expect it to come to you. Generally the market is still on bigger centralised exchanges. I wish it wasn't but...

I know nothing about how to get listed on an exchange but can't we aim for Binanance or similar? They list loads of coins. Binance CEO recently tipped Komodo as one to watch, I read in Komodo's 5 bullet Friday recently üòâ

[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Guys with multiple rigs / wallets...

Do you keep anything mined in separately wallets or combine them in to one?

If so, how?

Thanks


[16-Aug-18 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @ChrisC30a I spread everything across multiple transparent addresses to get better staking results


[16-Aug-18 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> @ok88 I heard that this does not matter.


[16-Aug-18 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @bigtom How so? If an address strikes a stake block it's not staking again for X blocks, spreading into smaller UTXO will lower the downtime of coins in the staking process


[16-Aug-18 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bigtom> That is what I thought, but according to @miketout in #staking , this is not the case. Maybe there was some miscommunication there?


[16-Aug-18 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @ok88 this is true, but once you get down to an amount that takes longer than a few thousand blocks to stake, the difference is minimal and offset by the time it can take to run through more transactions if you split them further. Right now, I am keeping my UTXOs 1000 or under, because it's convenient and I consider them small enough. I was originally recommending no larger than 500.


[16-Aug-18 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> Basically, we should keep em low (under 1000) and dispersed to stake effectively, having all in one wallet seems not right then. The optimum UTXO will increase with the growing supply and lower staking profits, but still having a single wallet is not the best way to stake.

[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @brixporter The Z Cash privacy protocol is a bit different than most.  After you  mine coins and they are mature, you need to first send them to a Z Address that you create as a Receive address in your wallet.  Ie., you send them from your mining address to your Z Address (and you check the button that says ...

[16-Aug-18 11:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @ok88 you can keep them all in one address even. How they are split makes no difference in probability of the total, aside from not being in UTXOs that are too large.


[16-Aug-18 11:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @jimboscott actually, that is the Zcash protocol, which creates opt-out privacy. KMD has opt-in privacy and has removed the requirement. VRSC has the same requirement as Zcash.


[16-Aug-18 12:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @miketout Thanks for the clarification....  I should have realized that it is a Z address for a reason and not a K address...

[16-Aug-18 09:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @xRobeSx that's correct. Since the rollout of the pools happened as we were upgrading from 0.3.11, which had been causing people to lag and sometimes fork a little, I believe a fork/reorg happened during that combined upgrade and hash power reallocation that didn't resolve as automatically as it should have. We have a strong main chain, but there seem to be some people on a fork left over from that. I just want to make sure everyone stays productive on the main chain, which is the reason for my announce. If my theory is correct, we basically hit a perfect storm and are still fine, but through an unlikely combination of events, I have figured out how to make the chain completely immune to what may have happened going forward.

[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoAlex> @Mische There is an explanation on the FAQ, it's really simple/straight forward.


[17-Aug-18 07:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoAlex> @ChrisC30a Proof of Stake (PoS) is a distributed consensus mechanism that a person can mine or validate blocks according to how many coins he or she holds. Holding coins on your wallet for that purpouse is what is called staking. There is a lot of info on the internet about it, that is prob enough for you to start üòÉ

[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @miketout `I believe this is a result of the lag issues we had in 0.3.11. It is not a required update to 0.3.12, but everyone who can upgrade, should.` some Notary nodes are saying this is incorrect, and they could not sync until they upgraded to 0.3.12, fyi. I was using 0.3.11 fine for a while, but it seems some of my miners have gone onto a fork, and current network conditions may mean that 0.3.12 is a necessary update


[17-Aug-18 09:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @dukeleto Thank you. if there was any consensus change, it is not something I put in directly and would have to relate to the merge with KMD, which I understood had no consensus change. I'm looking into whether there may have been an unexpected, notary-related consensus change in the latest KMD merge.

[17-Aug-18 01:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @ChrisC30a Here are the steps...

1. Create a Z address in your wallet - this is a Private Address - NOT to be confused with a private KEY.  Create this in the 'Receive' section of the wallet.
2. Now, go to the SEND section of the wallet and make a new transaction.  When you do this, you will click the button that says "Shield all recent coinbase transactions" and input your Z address in the 'send to' line.  There is no need to input the amount.  This will shield ALL unshielded coins.
3. Once that transaction has ONE confirmation, send the coins BACK to a regular Transparent address.  You will click the button that says 'Send from a private address".  Enter the amount (allow a very small portion for fees) and send the VRSC to your T address (regular transparent address).
4. Wait for 150 confirmations and those coins will be staking.

[dscrdvrsc] <aekiaeki> Does this mean that my wallet is still syncing?

yes

[17-Aug-18 02:01 PM] Mische#6695
correct me if I'm wrong, downloading agama v0.3.12-beta, start VRSC in native, wait till synced, and starting the miner will get rewards? It's been 2 hours with: Local Mega Hash/s: 63.933
and still got nothing. Did I do something wrong?


[17-Aug-18 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> With that hashrate you should have a block in two weeks or something, just let it run everything is fine


[17-Aug-18 02:09 PM] CHMEX#0686
At current hashrate statisticly approx 2 months. Maybe poolmining is safer for you


[17-Aug-18 02:38 PM] Mische#6695
I got it running now for luck pool, however I got it working for Decker now, how do I change the receiving address ?


[17-Aug-18 02:39 PM] Mische#6695
on windows 10


[17-Aug-18 02:46 PM] Mische#6695

[18-Aug-18 08:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> It took me at my longest 37 days to find a 96 coin block,
Iv been on the pools for the past 2-3 days, with my 30mh/s in nheqminer and iv got 1.15 vrsc , 
Looks like i had better odds at solo mining , i could be wrong,


[18-Aug-18 08:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Only had payouts so far from luck pool, small payments, like 0.13 every hour or so maybe a bit longer, i do know xyz pool has upped the min payout to 3 vrsc to help the network , nothing wrong with that, iv just had most of my info from luck pool


[18-Aug-18 09:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @Matterbridge You did nothing wrong.  64 Mh/s is going to produce a block (on average) at a rate of about 1 per month, assuming a network hashrate of about 2400 Gh/s.


[18-Aug-18 09:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @stretcher83 Technically speaking, your odds are much better a pool mining because you WILL get something.   With 30 Mh/s, you could conceivably hit some bad luck and go 4-6 months with nothing.


[18-Aug-18 09:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Thats a sad fact that im truly not looking forward to, but iv decided to keep 1 pc on the luck pool , and my second pc , my fastest one , is going to stay solo mining, if it takes longer than my last block did on this machine(37 days) , then ill probably put it on the pool too,


[18-Aug-18 09:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Im kinda hooked on solo mining for now, it just keeps whispering in my ear..... come back !

no am i supposed to be using those?


[19-Aug-18 07:57 AM] CHMEX#0686
Or do a getblockhash on your last block and compare with the explorer

Decker posted that in notarynode looks like he runs it like that and does not have problems

[19-Aug-18 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> they should not be able to be on a fork, as far as I know


[19-Aug-18 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> and I'm not aware of any new forks since the last between 0.3.11 and 0.3.12

[19-Aug-18 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it looks like the exchange is fine, and I will help @JoeCrypto off of the fork


[19-Aug-18 02:58 PM] jspook16#3059
looks like two of my miners came back up on the fork..


[19-Aug-18 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> what version?


[19-Aug-18 05:05 PM] jspook16#3059
im on 0.3.12


[19-Aug-18 05:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> what block height are they on? if they are on the fork, it would seem you should be isolated. have you tried getmining info to see what the difficulty is?


[19-Aug-18 05:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> if you weren't isolated, you would pick up the notarized chain. is it notarized?


[19-Aug-18 07:37 PM] jspook16#3059
im on block height 126977


[19-Aug-18 07:37 PM] jspook16#3059
verus explorer is on 127065


[19-Aug-18 07:38 PM] jspook16#3059
Ive tried resynching twice now and I end up on the same fork


[19-Aug-18 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> somehow, you are picking up seed nodes that are still on the fork. have you added these lines to your VRSC.conf from the announce?
seednode=185.25.48.236:27485
seednode=185.25.48.236:27487
seednode=185.64.105.111:27485

seednode=185.25.48.72:27485
seednode=185.25.48.72:27487


[19-Aug-18 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> that was the different between 0.03.12 and 0.03.12a in the daemon. the presence of these nodes


[19-Aug-18 09:59 PM] jspook16#3059
I did not have those lines. I've added them and am attempting another resync.


[19-Aug-18 10:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> you'll need to fresh sync. if you are in sync with the fork already, i don't know that you can easily get off


[19-Aug-18 11:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> start with -connect=<seednode> using the ip address of the seednode and dont have any -addnode


[19-Aug-18 11:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> that will force connection to just one node

[dscrdvrsc] <brixporter> should the coins shielded from the wallet before sending to exchange?


[20-Aug-18 03:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <brixporter> or we can send either shielded or unshielded??


[20-Aug-18 03:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <brixporter> tried to send by doing both but did not arrived in exchange, 30 mins already..does it take time?


[20-Aug-18 03:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <brixporter> entered block hash not found in the explorer


[20-Aug-18 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <brixporter> coins gone?


[20-Aug-18 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <brixporter> @JoeCrypto did you resolve your issue?


[20-Aug-18 04:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CHMEX> if the blockhash is not in the explorer you are on a fork


[20-Aug-18 04:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CHMEX> your coins if mined before you went on a fork are still on the mainchain


[20-Aug-18 04:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <brixporter> is it lost?

[20-Aug-18 04:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <brixporter> anything i should do?


[20-Aug-18 04:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CHMEX> I dont know the exact details of your case but if you mined them on a fork than they are not worth anything because fork
If you mined mainchain coins and spend them on the fork they are still on the mainchain.
If you want post or send me your R address and I try to help you might need to resync your chain

[dscrdvrsc] <jr.trump> Hello everyone, I have built a website to make a little game, in order to help distribute the Verus among more users, increase the number of transactions in the Verus network, as well as favoring the adoption of Verus. I know it's not a big deal, but as I said it's a small game, the operation of the game is backed by enough Verus so that it can run smoothly for several years.
If the game is successful, I surely take out a Verus faucet so that people can get in easily and for free. If you want to take a look the link to the web is https://verusgame.webnode.es/

Thanks and I hope you like it

[20-Aug-18 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> generally speaking, sending funds to a private address to play in a raffle pool creates a completely unauditable, private process that theoretically no one would be able to verify. i appreciate the creativity of a game, but please don't send funds to a private address to be tallied in a raffle and expect to be treated fairly. I don't know @jr.trump or whether he has anything but intent to do the right thing, but basically any other way would be more transparent than this one

Unlocked funds, send to an address you generated in the final wallet. Locked funds, dumpprivkey for each address and importprivkey from cli


[20-Aug-18 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @TexWiller made a FAQ some time ago, which is in the #faq-chosen channel, along with a lot of great stuff. From the FAQ:
Q: How to consolidate multiple wallet.dat files in one?
 
Answer:
1) Edit the VRSC.conf file on each instance you have, adding the following line: exportdir=/LOCAL_PATH/ (ie /home/user/)
2) Restart verusd
3) Issue the following command (on the verus-cli): z_exportwallet FILENAME (ie z_exportwallet export_instance01)
4) Copy the generated file to the machine who host your main wallet
5) Issue the following command (on the "main" verus-cli): z_importwallet /LOCAL_PATH/FILENAME (ie /home/user/export_instance01)


[20-Aug-18 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> you can do this on the GUI as well, but use the Settings->CLI to enter the z_exportwallet and z_importwallet commands
make sure that before you do this, you backup all of your wallet files carefully


[20-Aug-18 08:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Scrotum Tickler> where do you find the  z_exportwallet and z_importwallet commands?


[20-Aug-18 08:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> you enter them as command line commands in the Settings->CLI </> section of the settings menu in the wallet. you need to select VRSC (native), then enter the command below and press the execute button. The commands would be:
z_exportwallet filename
and to import:
z_importwallet filename


[20-Aug-18 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Scrotum Tickler> Thanks Mike .......I will give it a go


[20-Aug-18 09:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jr.trump> @miketout  @ok88  I understand what you say, but keep in mind that if you sent to a transparent address everyone would see if that transaction has already been made or not , therefore there would only be 1 daily transaction and the game does not make sense.
Regarding the fee, that is indicated on the web, if you distribute 90%, then you can say it is 10%, although it is not correct because if they played 4 people or less then I would have to put remaining up to 0.5 VRSC, as indicated on the web.
Also with most of the fee, it would be to build after a faucet and other things related to Verus.
Anyway, people are free to participate or not, I do not intend to swindle anyone 0.1 VRSC, if nobody wants to play, nothing happens. I will close the web and think of another more reliable way to do it.
I hope I have clarified your doubts.
Best regards.


[20-Aug-18 09:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> look at the command z_exportviewingkey. you may be able to let others view all transactions after the game, leaving maximum loss at one game's worth. or you could publish the private key and make a new z-addr every week, which might be easier for anyone to import and look at the results. you'll have to explain to people how to import the key if you do that


[20-Aug-18 09:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jr.trump> I also say that I will try to do it in the most transparent way possible, showing each ID of transactions (that even though you can not see the amount or address to which they go, but yes, you can see the date and time), I will also publish the payment information and I will show a capture of the balance of that address with the calculations made. If people wanted, I would not mind doing an online excel so that each incoming transaction can be checked starting at 4:59 PM, as well as the payment exit transaction.
As I said, I do not think that they play more than 10 VRSC per day, since each person will only play once and to play 10 VRSC they would have to play 100 people and 10 VRSC are approximately 1-2 $, so they do not. I think nobody bothers to do something to scam 1-2 $


[20-Aug-18 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jr.trump> Yes, I have no problem in giving the private key of the address after the game, as well as the data that people want, as I said, I can put everything in a public excel so that you enter and see everything after the game ends


[20-Aug-18 09:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jr.trump> I'm going to work on the excel now, I make some changes on the web and pass the links.

Any suggestion tell me, and I will try to carry it out.

Thank you.

[20-Aug-18 09:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Scrotum Tickler> What am I doing wrong?


[20-Aug-18 09:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> you can only set exportdir in the VRSC.conf, as explained in the faq


[20-Aug-18 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> commands are above as shown


[20-Aug-18 10:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Scrotum Tickler> I have entered the z_exportwallet_ command with the FILENAME as    /LOCAL_PATH/Local Disk C:/Users/Owner/AppData/Roaming/Komodo/VRSC    and the  CLI response is still  wrong cli string format. Any idea what I am doing wrong here?


[20-Aug-18 10:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> z_exportwallet filename
and to import:
z_importwallet filename
exact command with underscore and no folder name, just file. exportdir, which is the folder for the file must be set in VRSC.conf


[20-Aug-18 10:29 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <jr.trump> Ok I just reviewed and the installation part is not in the version of Verus, you just have to download the wallet from the Verus website, use "sudo apt-get install libc6-i386 libgconf-2-4 libcurl3", unzip the wallet and then you run with "./Agama"

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> CryptoRich has a video for Mac, but basically install is unpack and run in place. You should not use the Komodo docs for Verus, as there are often differences


[21-Aug-18 12:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jr.trump> Yes, I have been confused with Komodo guide, I installed it some time ago and you can see that I did not remember well, I have recorded a video for you, the video is not very good, but well in 2 minutes I think it is clear

[21-Aug-18 12:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vy Low> @jr.trump awesome thank you very much


[21-Aug-18 12:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vy Low> already pm you


[21-Aug-18 01:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jr.trump> You're welcome, I send you the file by PM, if someone else wants, tell me, I have nothing with Vimeo and I have done the video for free distribution so if you want to share or do anything you have my consent


[21-Aug-18 01:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jr.trump> I have been asked about how to back up the wallet, so I have also made this other video https://vimeo.com/285968951, like the previous one, if someone else wants to have it delivered to me by PM, you can also distribute it freely


[21-Aug-18 01:39 AM] Gateway#3763

[21-Aug-18 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jr.trump> I have been updating the web and doing the excel that can be accessed with this link https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iAUMSQ91Ki88XRMkTD7F9bcCGLai_Ge7N0pLwg6PEY8/edit#gid=0 available also on the web, I think it is all the information that I can contribute on the game so that it is transparent, if someone wants me to add anything that lets me know, on the web I have also updated the instructions to play in case they were not clear enough.
I will wait a few days to prepare the wallet and see if there are any errors before starting the first game, the day before I will tell you, any questions send me a PM

[dscrdvrsc] <Shaun> now it occured again


[21-Aug-18 07:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Shaun> how to deal with it

[21-Aug-18 07:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Shaun> some days ago  i have solved this problem


[21-Aug-18 07:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Will a z-z address go through?


[21-Aug-18 07:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Then try z-t from the different z address?


[21-Aug-18 07:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Shaun> howerver it occured again now


[21-Aug-18 07:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Absolutely no expert here, just spitballing


[21-Aug-18 07:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> What was your previous fix?


[21-Aug-18 07:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Shaun> from Z to T


[21-Aug-18 07:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Shaun> my previous solution is sending some coin from different wallet to my z address


[21-Aug-18 07:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Shaun> and it will work


[21-Aug-18 07:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Shaun> i dont know why this problem  happens over and over


[21-Aug-18 09:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> So roughly 32,000 vrsc will begin to mature every day starting tomorrow until 2 years from now


[21-Aug-18 09:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> My math about right?


[21-Aug-18 09:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Digitalprice will get interesting


[21-Aug-18 09:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> seems a bit on the high side, I thought it would be like an extra 15 coins per block


[21-Aug-18 09:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> so less than the halving effect


[21-Aug-18 09:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> I dont expect much change in the pricing


[21-Aug-18 09:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> hashrate is climbing fast


[21-Aug-18 09:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> What‚Äôs the current total coin supply (mature + immature)?


[21-Aug-18 09:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> 28MM roughly based on some envelope math


[21-Aug-18 09:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> 4MM currently circulating that are matured


[21-Aug-18 09:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> 24MM / 730 days


[21-Aug-18 09:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> What did the initial rewards ramp look like?


[21-Aug-18 09:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> 0-384?


[21-Aug-18 09:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Linear?


[21-Aug-18 09:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> 1,2,3,4,5?


[21-Aug-18 09:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CHMEX> Block reward starts with a linear ramp, changing every block, for the first 10,080 blocks (1 week) going from 0 to the peak reward of 384. From that point forward, block reward will halve monthly for the following 5 months, then every 2 years after that. All block rewards, whether mined or staked, with a reward above or equal to 192 VRSC will be time locked for a random release time between block 129,600 and 1,181,520 (3 months to 2 years and 3 months after genesis). bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4070404.0


[21-Aug-18 09:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CHMEX> Total: 29'968'026    
Transparent: 29'941'69
Shielded: 26'328    
b addresses: 26'332'323
R addresses: 3'607'563


[21-Aug-18 10:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CHMEX> some b addresses might be already matured or multisig  which have to be signed by x parties @Hollowman9000


[21-Aug-18 10:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Just going off calculating total amount of block rewards >=192


[21-Aug-18 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> 384*4wks*7days*24hrs*60mins


[21-Aug-18 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> 192 times the same


[21-Aug-18 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Not an exact block number


[21-Aug-18 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Works for magnitudes


[21-Aug-18 10:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> My reward maturation is fairly linear over 2 years


[21-Aug-18 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CHMEX> that gives something like 23'224'320


[21-Aug-18 10:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CHMEX> so 280 blocks till the first  timelocked ones mature


[21-Aug-18 10:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Then the linear ramp rewards that met or exceeded 192


[21-Aug-18 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Roughly 24MM


[21-Aug-18 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> going to be interesting


[21-Aug-18 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Current market cap somewhere 3-4MM


[21-Aug-18 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> 540-591 CMC rank


[21-Aug-18 10:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Somewhere in there


[21-Aug-18 10:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Then again 69120 reward reduction per day with the halving


[21-Aug-18 10:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Fair enough @jl777c


[21-Aug-18 10:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> 22.2 per block essentially


[21-Aug-18 10:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Drop from 96 to 70.2


[21-Aug-18 10:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> I wonder how many miners were on the original 384 rewards


[21-Aug-18 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> If they‚Äôre hodlers or not


[21-Aug-18 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> They seem to have a downvote mafia on r/Cryptocurrency or something. We announce a halving in a week and tell people they don't have to buy, but can mine 96 coin rewards only for one more week, and we're getting 50% downvoted, soon to drop off the page.

that is the one on the mainchain, the one 2 blocks behind might or might not be, you need to check blockhashes


[22-Aug-18 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> the 685 is almost certainly on a fork

[dscrdvrsc] <arton> those are two of mine: 195.128.228.141, 195.128.228.142


[22-Aug-18 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the forked chain, last I heard was in the 120s. I am not aware of any fork in the 130 range. @Hollowman9000 my guess is that the difference in those heights was simply a network latency issue and two fast blocks. The seednode entries from the announcement should suffice.
The fork was a combination of unfortunate events, but not just random, and it is not an indication that it should happen again. If you don't have 0.3.12a or the seed nodes in your VRSC.conf from the announce, there is still a chance you may hit the fork on a new sync. There do still seem to be some seed nodes that we are getting from the a seed server we don't run that may be still on the fork. The fork was caused by specific coincidental events related to a pool and notaries on an old version, combined with a rule change we unexpectedly pulled in from our merge with KMD that only affected a chain with pools at exactly the time pools were coming online. The new rule from KMD is now active on the chain and there is nothing to contribute along with other events to create the situation again.
Regarding the hash power of the chain, the difficulty is 45 billion, not the hash power, the hash power is about 12 GH/s. There are some people on it still who have not upgraded and/or synch'ed, but it is about 1/500th of the main chain in power.

[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @miketout Just noticed that my wallet balance is different on the explorer than it is in my wallet... explorer shows about 191 VRSC more than my wallet...  I think I heard of this happening before but do not remember the resolution or reason.


[22-Aug-18 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> From @miketout ...
the good news is that the blockchain is right. The easiest and most complete way is through the command line (or settings->CLI) and first requires setting the "exportdir=<path>" in your VRSC.conf to a trusted location on your storage drive. Once you close and restart with that setting, you can run the CLI command, either from the CLI in the wallet or the actual command line:
z_exportwallet filenamenopath
Then you can close your wallet completely, rename your wallet.dat, so that you no longer have a wallet.dat in the VRSC folder, force creating a new one, then load again. Now run:
z_importwallet filenamenopath
which will recreate your wallet from scratch with all keys, leave any fork residue behind, and sync all of your transactions from the chain(edited)


[22-Aug-18 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> z_importwallet filenamenopath did not work - says cannot open wallet dump file...  üò∂

Get and compile from verus repo and start synching it. They dont hurt each other just make sure you run verus from inside the verus dir.

they are either in a private zaddr or you mined them on a fork between version 11 and 12


[25-Aug-18 07:31 AM] bishop#9773
Considering that tx isn't valid on the explorer, those coins were mined on a forked chain


[25-Aug-18 07:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <sys039995> Then do I switch back to 0.3.11 to use these coins

no, that's a forked chain

those coins are worthless


[25-Aug-18 07:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <arton> @sys039995  just check your real balance on the explorer https://explorer.veruscoin.io/
If you see more on your wallet that means that you were mining/staking on forked chain and those coins are usless

[25-Aug-18 08:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Can someone please explain to me the following strangeness happening on my account? I had 4 coins in my account. I created a new address and then sent 0.01 coins to another account that's not mine, in the same transaction the rest of my coins was also sent to an address I've never seen before and that does not come up in the list of my addresses when I run getaddressesbyaccount from the cli, but DOES validate to true when I run validateaddress from the cli. I never sent those other 4 coins, just the 0.01 coin was sent, just how is this possible?


[25-Aug-18 08:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Here is where I sent 0.01 coins from RFqN57nVW7mtSd2cg1NehcAAWdFsSFXF1j to RHjsgwcy87GzXDNpxuhdG9LVqxEbu6yVno https://explorer.veruscoin.io/address/RFqN57nVW7mtSd2cg1NehcAAWdFsSFXF1j , the 4 coins sent to RDd2woyS8yTsJPgDqyRNQAdF7ewjuQpfQG was not sent by me, all I wrote was this command: komodo-cli -ac_name=VRSC sendtoaddress "RHjsgwcy87GzXDNpxuhdG9LVqxEbu6yVno" "0.01"


[25-Aug-18 08:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> The recieving address RHjsgwcy87GzXDNpxuhdG9LVqxEbu6yVno does not appear in my address list:

komodo-cli -ac_name=VRSC getaddressesbyaccount ""

But the address RHjsgwcy87GzXDNpxuhdG9LVqxEbu6yVno does validate even though not in the list:

[25-Aug-18 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @jimboscott And where does that unknown public key come from as its not on my address list but still validates with my private key.


[25-Aug-18 08:40 AM] bishop#9773
since no one listens, Jimbo, you got this


[25-Aug-18 08:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @Crupti Your wallet creates new public keys.  This is not like a QT Wallet coin where you have to do that yourself.  The wallet starts with a pool of public keys (and, of course, the private keys for them).  But it will also create new keys on the fly.  These get used for your 'change'.


[25-Aug-18 08:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> So if I have 100 VRSC in one UTXO and send 50 to a different address - it seems that is the same thing as pulling a 100 dollar bill out - leaving the address that held it, then splitting it.  The change comes BACK to me, but at a different address.


[25-Aug-18 08:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> In real life, it comes back to my WIFE's wallet about 100% of the time.


[25-Aug-18 08:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @jimboscott üòâ Ok, thanks for answering.


[25-Aug-18 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I really wish there was a way to clean the wallet up so that all of the little details did not clutter things up...  but as long as your balance is right then all should be well.


[25-Aug-18 08:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @arton The issue with the fork was not foreseen.  It coincided with the creation of pools and the release of the new wallet.  Sort of a perfect storm.   In retrospect it should have been mandatory.  But nobody could see clearly enough into the future to make that call prior to its release.


[25-Aug-18 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Another thing I wanted to bring up is _transaction times_. I'm not proud of it, but I have dabbled with Ripple XRP and EOS for some time, and their transactions take less that 1 minute to confirm. I know that it's technically hard to compete with those blockchains with a *truly* distributed blockchain like this, but two hours is a very long time for a transaction imo. Is there any worked being done on this issue?


[25-Aug-18 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @Crupti It does not take 2 hours for me to send coins to you.


[25-Aug-18 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Or for you to send to me.


[25-Aug-18 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> It takes two hours (a little less actually) to confirm a mined block - unless you are having wallet issues.


[25-Aug-18 08:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @Crupti shoot me a public T address - I will send you a VRSC


[25-Aug-18 08:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Let's see how long before it is confirmed in your wallet


[25-Aug-18 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @jimboscott That may be so, but in reality people don't get their money until 1-2 hours. I experimented today by sending 0.01 coins to my exchange, that was 48 minutes ago and it's still not available for trading with 113/120 confirmations.


[25-Aug-18 08:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> OHHH.... an exchange.   There's your problem.


[25-Aug-18 08:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> The exchange is setting the rules.


[25-Aug-18 08:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Not Verus


[25-Aug-18 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @jimboscott Ok, so more confirmations needed with an exchange then, I gather?


[25-Aug-18 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Just because the exchange says so.  They may be creating a big lag in order to stake their balance.


[25-Aug-18 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Just sent you 1 VRSC, BTW


[25-Aug-18 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @jimboscott Thanks, very nice of you üòÑ


[25-Aug-18 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Let me know when your balance ticks up


[25-Aug-18 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Ok, I'll send it back once I'e gotten it confirmed on my side.


[25-Aug-18 08:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> And, the UTXO it came from was a 3.2 VRSC payment from a pool.   My available balance just went DOWN 3.2 VRSC - but when you get your 1,  I will get 2.2 back in change.


[25-Aug-18 08:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Probably to an address that no human has ever seen before.


[25-Aug-18 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <arton> @jimboscott - as you wrote, time showed that an update to 0.3.12 should be mandatory. I totally agree with you, no one could foresee those fork problems that appeared


[25-Aug-18 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @jimboscott Got it now, did not take long


[25-Aug-18 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I show 3 confirms here now.


[25-Aug-18 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Exchanges seem to like to play games.  I do not know for sure, but requiring 120 confirmations for a deposit seems completely out of line.   Most I have seen before was 6.


[25-Aug-18 09:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @jimboscott Having a hard time figuring out your sender address, was it RHEMuyCfSBUpwJ5XRrdd3msXUKw6Tp9EJg ?


[25-Aug-18 09:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @jimboscott So, sender's addresses are hidden as part of the privacy coin thingy, I guess. We'll can't send the 1 coin back to you then, hope you won't regret this when it reaches BTC price levels (fingers crossed) üòÇ


[25-Aug-18 09:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Will be a funny story to tell people in the future about this guy that sent me $20k to test network transaction times üëå


[25-Aug-18 09:28 AM] bishop#9773
No... if it was sent from a taddr, you can see who sent it. If it was sent from a zaddr, you can't


[25-Aug-18 11:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @Crupti I had a guy that I did some Ravencoin escrow for DM me and say "I am going to send you some RVN... give me your addy".   I sent him my address and the next day there was 10K more RVN in my wallet.  At the time that was worth about 400 USD.   Less than half of that now, but in three to four years?   Who knows....

[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @jimboscott Found an explaination in the whitepaper I think: "When a staker performs the test for eligibility and discovers a winning UTXO for a block, they can add that UTXO as a no-fee spend to themselves to the end of that block, validate the block in all other respects, and submit that block to the Verus network, along with the coinbase transaction, which pays new coins to the same address of the staking transaction at the end of the block."

[26-Aug-18 07:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Was error code -3


[26-Aug-18 07:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> It was listing an amount with decimal places way beyond 8


[26-Aug-18 07:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Something like that 383.999800000005


[26-Aug-18 07:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Discord kept deleting the number for some reason when I typed it


[26-Aug-18 07:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Reduced tx by .0001 and it went through


[26-Aug-18 07:42 AM] jspook16#3059
Yeah I just cut the number down and it goes through no problem


[26-Aug-18 07:42 AM] jspook16#3059
You're staking too?


[26-Aug-18 07:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Yea


[26-Aug-18 07:43 AM] jspook16#3059
Right on


[26-Aug-18 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @Hollowman9000 If you have already made the .0001 adjustment for the Tx fee, just lop off everything from the 9th decimal and beyond and I bet it works just fine.

[dscrdvrsc] <Krypto Koning> I'm having trouble with deposits: Agama wallet says: "Succesfull transaction", but it doesn't show up in VRSC Explorer?! Plz help


[26-Aug-18 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Krypto Koning> I got a reply on twitter about me being on my own fork or something, and to come here for help ‚ù§


[26-Aug-18 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Krypto Koning> How do i fix it, and did i loose the coins i've sent already on the wrong fork? üò¶


[26-Aug-18 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> That‚Äôs not how forking works


[26-Aug-18 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Krypto Koning> i believe you


[26-Aug-18 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Krypto Koning> i have no clue


[26-Aug-18 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Worst that would happen is that you‚Äôll see the coins back in your account


[26-Aug-18 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Krypto Koning> that wouldnt be so bad )


[26-Aug-18 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> When sending from exchanges, that may be a different story


[26-Aug-18 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> As their private accounting may not reflect the leading chain


[26-Aug-18 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Krypto Koning> i see


[26-Aug-18 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Krypto Koning> so how can i fix it?


[26-Aug-18 02:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Explain exactly what you did


[26-Aug-18 02:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Did you send from agama?


[26-Aug-18 02:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Or exchange


[26-Aug-18 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Krypto Koning> from agama to exchange


[26-Aug-18 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Krypto Koning> i selected transparent funds wallet, amount and the recieving adress


[26-Aug-18 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Krypto Koning> i get succes as a return with TXiD and everything, but those dont seem to be legit when i check them in veruscoin explorer


[26-Aug-18 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Krypto Koning> should i try to reset the wallet completely? or will that make me loose coins?


[26-Aug-18 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Krypto Koning> nvm if i keep the wallet.dat files i should be fine

[dscrdvrsc] <Krypto Koning> point 1 says: "backup your wallet.dat file or move it out of your Komodo directory. Repeat this for all other Komodo coins, including Komodo "
Where is the komodo wallet.dat? I've found the VRSC wallet.dat already, but where's the komodo one?


[26-Aug-18 05:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CrisF> Hi, I have re-installed VRSC (cli ubuntu).  I have copied my wallet.dat into .komodo/VRSC and am now syncing.  Do I need to do anything else, like `importwallet` or `importprivkey`?


[26-Aug-18 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Are there any addresses not showing?


[26-Aug-18 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Only reason I could think of using importprivkey


[26-Aug-18 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CrisF> @Hollowman9000 , It's still re-syncing.  Is pasting in the wallet.dat usually enough?

[28-Aug-18 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoAlex> @Hollowman9000 From CMC FAQ
The criteria for a cryptocurrency to be listed is the following:

- Must be a cryptocurrency or a crypto token.  (OK)
- Must be on a public exchange with an API that reports the last traded price and the last 24 hour trading volume. (DP is getting there, it seems)
- Must have a non-zero trading volume on at least one supported exchange so a price can be determined.  (OK)
- For market cap ranking, an accurate circulating supply figure is required. (OK)

If you'd like to have a cryptocurrency listed and it meets all of the criteria, please fill out the request form.


[28-Aug-18 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> I thought it was a minimum of $500k


[28-Aug-18 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Maybe that was adding an exchange to CMC


[28-Aug-18 04:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Right now, it's a question of being on a supported exchange and getting accepted, as far as I know.

[dscrdvrsc] <wistar> @miketout : Ah, gawd. I actually know Matt Blaze from a long time ago (via his then girlfriend Jutta Degener). I am a little surprised at his broad brush denouncement.


[29-Aug-18 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763

[29-Aug-18 11:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @miketout mostly looking to just spark discussion. Matt did help design ZeroCoin protocol, which evolved into Zcash protocol that KMD/VRSC/ZEC all have at their core. I agree about "blithe tweets" and also, he has probably earned the right to be blithe. He just ran a voting machine hacking event at DefCon, he is very deep into the now-and-here election technology world, and seems pretty jaded by fancy new technologies like blockchains/etc

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i think when you're blasting real tech of real projects, gaining fame and then being blithe about your own failure to do something securely is irresponsible


[29-Aug-18 12:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> actually, I confused him with Matt Green from Zerocoin protocol, oops


[29-Aug-18 12:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> Most likely he is talking about the 999 scammy coins out there that have no tech and are telling people their ICO will solve elections, and has never heard of Verus


[29-Aug-18 12:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> Matt Blaze is of clipper chip fame


[29-Aug-18 12:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> if anything, he is a very informed and knowledgeable devil's advocate, and does deal with day-to-day election machine security


[29-Aug-18 12:03 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> could be that and the centralized solutions that charge millions of $ to run an election on a private blockchain, where the software looks cool, but they are in as much control over the security as if they used Diebold machines. They gain ground because of ignorance and that ignorance obscuring even the existence of the problems to solve and the value of real solutions, just as scammers obscure blockchain benefits. claiming "all", as if he's an actual expert on the projects he doesn't take time to learn about just spreads ignorance and makes a real solution more difficult to discover and use. if he would make actual credible claims, like "I haven't seen" or "I would like to see" or "I'll give xxx in my challenge to see", then he might contribute value to the discussion


[29-Aug-18 12:08 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> @miketout will it be possible to make privacy only assetchain with verushash ?

[29-Aug-18 11:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> we are already testing a test assetchain with privacy only chain, but I wonder if we can use verus algo instead of equihash


[29-Aug-18 11:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it's possible. i haven't ever tested it


[29-Aug-18 11:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> verushash isn't integrated into the main Komodo yet, and I'm just helping do it in CHIPS. if it was done in Komodo as a one off, without a proper merge, it would almost certainly make it much harder to get other tech moved over.

[30-Aug-18 03:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @miketout @grewalsatinder I am happy to inform you both that -ac_private is already included in Verus master branch: https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/commit/2f151c301925c9959d62d52a82d6ddcbe7971f00 and since -ac_private chains cant have any PoS, it's not compatible with Verus itself, and I am not sure if Verus asset chains will be 50/50 PoS or configurable, but in theory you should be able to use VerusHash + -ac_private together on a pure PoW chain

[30-Aug-18 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> if so can have a verushash PoW privacy only chain


[30-Aug-18 03:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> looked at the verusd script. if just copy it then a privacy only chain will have this command:

problem is, there are no price sources for VRSC


[11-Sep-18 02:23 AM] lukechilds#2707
Can't the BarterDEX network be it's own price source?


[11-Sep-18 02:23 AM] lukechilds#2707
it only makes sense to rely on external prices for established markets


[11-Sep-18 02:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
for markets exclusive to BarterDEX it should be the trade activity that sets the price


[11-Sep-18 02:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
and that should be the end goal for all currencies one volume is big enough


[11-Sep-18 02:26 AM] cipi#4502
don't know of such a feature


[11-Sep-18 02:28 AM] lukechilds#2707
I mean you just set the price you want to sell at, and Alices set the price they want to buy at

[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I read things about monero and how they onion there transactions so they are untraceable after that, but im trying to find out why this person iv been speaking to thinks lightening for btc is better, i think but im not that clever on these matters that its not as good as zk-snarks

[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> @miketout thanks, i do understand this i think, i trust the info iv seen that this is a super private way of transacting or just sharing info, im just still searching online for an answer to how this is much better than this lightening network,


[23-Sep-18 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @stretcher83 for privacy, nothing beats zero knowledge, because zero knowledge proofs separate the data from the proof of the data. That's why Monero and the ring sig based coins are all moving to bulletproofs or other forms of zero knowledge proofs. Lightning uses the Sphinx protocol, which is basically an improved Tor to provide multiple layers of encryption. This is still encryption of all relevant data, so theoretically, it can eventually be cracked, but to do so is very hard. To perform mathematical operations to ensure that transactions are correct, the lightning network needs to know the values of the transactions, which is another way to correlate who is doing what. This data also isn't used on zero knowledge transactions. While one can argue that Lighting has added a layer of privacy, I don't believe that privacy comes close to the theoretical privacy in zero knowledge systems.

[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Basically zk-snarks is (zero knowledge proofs)  which transmits no relevant user data ,and the lightening network does not have this, lightening network only encrypts data,  it has data that could be de-crypted , and used against the user in some fashion


[24-Sep-18 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Daiyox> I'm a day late to the party, but for what its worth lightning network I believe is analgous in a very loose / high level way to Komodo's dpow.  It's a network with the ability to record data on a blockchain for record keeping when needed, so 1000 transactions may take place, then a "snapshot" is created on the BTC chain recording that...I'll take Verus / Komodo's method any day over that method, blockchain (Verus)-> blockchain (KMD) -> blockchain (BTC) .. A "Network" with snapshots is great for maybe cryptokitty level stuff, I would't trust my Satoshi's with it though

Vitalik Says Ethereum Can Scale to 500 tx/s Using Zcash Technology
Vitalik Buterin believes that Ethereum can use Zcash's ZK-SNARKS technology to scale the ETH protocol by more than 3,000 percent.

If any of you guys have a minute to clap and retweet a quick article about a Komodo dICO called Equaliser please do. It will help spread the word about all the coins in the  Komodo ecosystem, as well as add much needed exposure to  Equaliser.
Thanks! üôè

[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> @ChrisC30a yes back up your wallet.dat file, i keep multiple copies from different time periods, just to be safe, but i also backup my entire komodo and agama folders too, located in %appdata% folders, i believe you dont have to go that far though but i like to be safe than sorry

[27-Sep-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> It looks like you could be on your own chain, im not exactly sure, but we are on agama version 0,3,13c now so your version 0,3,11 is very out dated now, i dont know how many coins you would still have if you get yourself back on the correct chain , maybe some maybe non , its hard to tell without seeing all your transactions


[27-Sep-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Do you find blocks every day, and how much hash rate do you have


[27-Sep-18 03:40 AM] Gateway#3763

[27-Sep-18 03:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ChrisC30a> Can I update the application? Will that move it across to the correct chain?

[27-Sep-18 03:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> It would take you weeks to months to find a block with only 10mh/s


[27-Sep-18 03:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> @ChrisC30a Yup, most of those coins are probably from wrong chain.


[27-Sep-18 03:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Unfortunately probably most of the blocks you have found would be void blocks, not worth anything, you might still have some early blocks that are ok but im not that clever on these things

[27-Sep-18 03:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> Make sure to backup your wallet.dat file. Then install latest wallet and resync. Then hopefully your coins from the right chain should be there. The coins from fork will be gone.

[dscrdvrsc] <etrnlgldnbraid> Hey all. I landed on a forked chain when I first synced Agama. Not sure how that happened but when I did getmininginfo in cli it showed me this


[28-Sep-18 08:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <etrnlgldnbraid> { "blocks": 96580, "currentblocksize": 1000, "currentblocktx": 0, "difficulty": 4986569830169.323, "errors": "", "genproclimit": 0, "localhashps": 0, "networkhashps": 1064892909935, "pooledtx": 0, "testnet": false, "chain": "main", "generate": true }


[28-Sep-18 10:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <etrnlgldnbraid> When I did the above my wallet was synced "100%" but was only at block 96580. Do you guys think the above hashrate represents this incorrect chain or does it reflect the actual chain?


[28-Sep-18 10:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> To me it looks like its still not on the correct chain

[28-Sep-18 10:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <etrnlgldnbraid> I did manage to sync to the correct chain, just noting that there is about 1TH still being mined in the wrong chain


[28-Sep-18 10:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Umm hopefully those coins stay on their chain where they belong ha


[28-Sep-18 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I imagine they'd have to


[28-Sep-18 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I suppose it could mean that net hash rate was that value at the time of that block hight , when the correct chain used to be at that block hight months ago, im just guessing here, i mean there carnt be too many people on there own chain nowadays giving it its own hash rate of 106489290995 , i hope not any way, i do understand though that some people turn on there miners and just leave it for long periods of time without keeping up-to date with the discord help posts or announcements,

[dscrdvrsc] <etrnlgldnbraid> @JohnWestbrook on chain and see my mined coins now. So thanks for that. The explanation from @stretcher83 above may make sense, just curious how I ended up  on a chain which is way behind but *might* have a ths of mining going on.


[28-Sep-18 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <JohnWestbrook> i‚Äôm not sure either, tbh how you ended up there, what version of the wallet are/were you on?


[28-Sep-18 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <etrnlgldnbraid> Same one I just synced. Just deleted everything except wallet.dat and redownload the same one


[28-Sep-18 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @etrnlgldnbraid I believe the #announcements section will be helpful for you - please check announcement from 07/23/2018. I assume you have just stayed on the chain that was no longer supported after halving. And for the nethash, I believe @stretcher83 is right and the value is a snapshot of nethash from last blocks of that abandoned chain üòÉ I assume that just based on the block hight you ended up on which corresponds to halving&mandatory wallet update ü§†

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I understand many of the great technologies that comprise Verus but I was wondering about the private z address function and how it compares to whatever monero is. Are there pros and cons to each technique or (less likely) is it all the same thing as and despite it not being its use case, if need be for some reason would Verus be able to step in and fill the same role with its tech tomorrow if for some reason monero ceased to exist today? Just curious about the z address function. Of course there is so much more to this project.

[dscrdvrsc] <wrxys> A newbie question. I'm supposed to be able to find my wallet.dat file here <system drive>/Users/<user name>/AppData/Roaming/Komodo/VRSC/wallet.dat, right? But with this latest AGAMA wallet, under Komodo folder, there is nothing but a file named as"komodo.conf". So where should I find my wallet.dat file? Thanks!


[29-Sep-18 10:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <benohanlon> @JohnWestbrook my man ‚úäüèª


[29-Sep-18 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> @wrxys is this the first time you have run agama wallet , if so maybe your antivirus blocked its full install and your wallet was unable to run properly and create all the other files it needs in the komodo folder


[29-Sep-18 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> You could check your antivirus logs to see if anything got quarantined or blocked upon instillation of agama, if it did, i would deactivate your antivirus, then redownload agama again from veruscoin.io website and let it run for a bit , like 10 - 20 mins then add exemptions for agama in your antivirus, then enable your antivirus again


[29-Sep-18 11:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Add the agama folder that you downloaded in to exemptions and the komodo folder and the agama folder located in %appdata% folder on your system

[dscrdvrsc] <cryptoprofit.zone> hi im cpu mining or trying to and soon as i start my batch file the miner opens and shuts straight away any reason for this ?


[29-Sep-18 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Did you create your own batch file or alter the original run.verushhash file

[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> @cryptoprofit.zone


[29-Sep-18 11:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I only ask because the first time i created my own batch file and ran into the same problem, so i just altered the contents of the original run.verushhash file with my own details , then clicked save then exit it and double click it to run it and it just worked then


[29-Sep-18 11:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Same thing aswell, always add exemptions in your antivirus for the new miner you have downloaded, even de activate the antivirus before you download the miner first, then when its run ok add your exemptions and then re activate your antivirus


[29-Sep-18 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> @cryptoprofit.zone Are you sure the cpu meet the requirements for mining the verushash?
Try to add "pause" after the standard command in the .bat file, then run. It should stop an show you an error instead of just closing the window.

[29-Sep-18 11:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> Yes. Not sure if pause needs to be on next line, but should work. The window closes before you can read any errors? Try with less than 12 threads perhaps.

[dscrdvrsc] <wrxys> @stretcher83 Thank you!  The Agama wallet was downloaded from the official homepage and I did check my antivirus software, there was nothing blocked.  This is just so weird...Is it because I generated a .PIN file, which is alternative to wallet.dat? Anyway, looks like I can use the wallet normally like receiving incoming coins and I also backed up the seed and WIF, so I guess I should be safe. Again, thank you!


[29-Sep-18 12:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Is it agama lite wallet you are using or agama native mode ?

[29-Sep-18 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <wrxys> @stretcher83 alright, that explains everything! I'm using the lite wallet. So without wallet.dat? Only native mode has it?

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Thought it might be a good chance to bring up Verus. The amazing tech speaks for itself, it's up to us to get the word out there so when people are presented with such an undeniably promising project they can't help but look deeper. Verus is like a technological onion. There are so many layers it can be hard to find the best approach at presenting it as most folks are used to just one technological "hook" per coin where Verus is a cohesive project of many.

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @cryptoprofit.zone you said you were new here- how new? Were you able to stake a block correctly or solo mine one yet? Figured I'd ask the obvious first- whether you got the coins from pool mining or if you have a very large Supply already and was able to stake blocks

[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @cryptoprofit.zone what do you mean by wallet being a clean install?

[04-Oct-18 06:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cryptoprofit.zone> i actually forgot i had mined these coins when the rewards were high and found the .dat file  backed up on a usb having just reimaged my pc i installed the new wallet copied in the dat fille and now having these problems i know a few on the coins are unshielded as i have been mining recently via a pool from memory i did shield a few that had matured before reinstalling the wallet if that helps also i notice that i have some R adresses and also some b adresses containing coins if that helps


[04-Oct-18 06:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> So agama display the coins as transparent balance or not?


[04-Oct-18 08:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @cryptoprofit.zone you probably already know this but coins gained from pool mining have already been shielded and don't need to be again. When you mind the coins when the rewards were high do you know how much the block was worth? Could they be time locked? A lot of the earliest block rewards were time locked.


[04-Oct-18 08:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That good to hear ok88, same deal here. Digging the project


[04-Oct-18 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> So staking rewards need to be shielded to stake?


[04-Oct-18 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Knew that was a thing with the timelocked coins


[04-Oct-18 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Not <=96 staking/mining rewards


[04-Oct-18 09:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @Hollowman9000 Yes, staked coins need to be shielded for sure


[04-Oct-18 09:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Thought that was just part of the script addresses of the timelocked rewards

[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> @miketout


[04-Oct-18 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Hollowman9000 all coinbases need to be shielded as part of the original Zcash protocol. that includes normal, smaller coinbases from both staking and mining.
@cryptoprofit.zone#5528 if you're not out of sync, you won't need to delete and resync. if you have the keys for the coins, it should be solvable. based on what you've said, it does seem that there is a likely issue of shielding/unshielding, but feel free to DM me for help. i'm deep in code/test/debug right now, but I will check in periodically


[04-Oct-18 10:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> So a mining/staking reward can be sent to a z address, and sent right back to the original address and then be valid for staking?

[04-Oct-18 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> 'right back' wont work, it'll take a bunch


[04-Oct-18 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> but basically, yes


[04-Oct-18 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> you'd `z_shieldcoinbase` your coinbases (mining/staking rewards) and then `z_sendmany` back to one of your addresses.


[04-Oct-18 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> but it's only coinbases, the payouts from pool aren't coinbases, these are just normal transactions


[04-Oct-18 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> Yes, just solo mined/staked blocks need shielding, pool shield the rewards for the users before sending (I guess? üòÉ ). If you run Agama in GUI, shielding is really easy with the "Shield all recent coinbase transactions" option and I recommend it for users that dislike putting cli commands up, it's really two mouseclicks.


[04-Oct-18 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> yea, the NOMP pools do the `z_shieldcoinbase` automagically after they find blocks. otherwise no payouts were possible.


[04-Oct-18 11:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @cryptoprofit.zone The correct Agama response is like that, so I think you really would need mike's help or other very early adopter to get your wallet working üëç It probably needs a kind of fix to be easily available for current Agama.

[04-Oct-18 11:42 AM] Gateway#3763

[04-Oct-18 11:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> or is there only a 'shield all' option?


[04-Oct-18 11:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> Shield all is default, there is a dropdown so I guess one might chose some specific coinbase? üòÆ I never had to shield some separately so it's a wild guess, but a dropdown suggest that its there for it üòÑ

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> What was up with that Reddit post? I'm surprised that there are people that feel that way. On one hand, I somewhat see their point but it's completely negated by the fact that verus brings a lot with it to the table and are close with the kmd devs. That was one inconsolable dude


[05-Oct-18 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Some people , all they want in life is there piece of the pie, no thoughts about changing the world for the better, 
only ‚Äú how much you gonna pay me ! ‚Äú .
that fella should grow up , join in with the rest of us helping to change the world , 
and take a chill pill.
He‚Äôs welcome to come here and mine verus with the rest of us , its still early days yet , he‚Äôs not missed out , earn some vrsc the same way we all have, by getting involved in this project and supporting an idea that can better the whole population of our planet , we are contributing to the future ,here 
and in most other block chain projects running today ,the idea of taking power back. I agree that there are scammers and greedy people out there giving crypto projects a bad name everywhere, 
even in other crypto discords.
But this idea / project that we are involved in is in no way a sh*t coin or a scam ,
Its a game changer , 
Im proud to think that I am part of this ,
also thankful and humbled for the previous and current work that has been done by the KOMODO team and its community , 
i hope we can all contribute towards this brighter future, together, 
For the new generations of people to come, after we have left this world,( like our children and grandchildren ),
Until then we can make some crypto profits along the way, the fair way , by contributing to the block chains. üí°‚õì‚öñÔ∏è‚õèüåéüåçüåèüí™

[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Yep, don‚Äôt get me wrong i know some people think blockchains was made for people to get rich on crypto, thats fine but i believe block chains and crypto was made to free people from all the corruptions in the world and make us  all equal , not dependant on the ruling class ,if you like .


[05-Oct-18 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> People can get more wealthy along the way , if it doesn‚Äôt impact others  equality . 
Rich and powerful people are just the same as me and all of us but the system that we are all forced to use is there system , and block chains and cryptos are an evolution in technology  and society that can fix the system by creating a new one , and we are all taking part in that change , i fully support that idea and will do my best to encourage others to help along the way , solidarity will bring that change for us all that bit faster .


[05-Oct-18 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'm totally with you I just wish that the institutions governing these new technologies would lay off and form new committees rather than using one's set up in the 1930s. They are trying to take new technologies and explain them to old set in their ways closed minded people. With the blockchain and all this crap about net neutrality there really should be a new technology division formed. Why is it that we are all such unoriginal bastards that are afraid to pave new paths? We have to try to take new stuff and try to fit it in an ancient box. Old and out of touch people who don't have any idea on what technology even is should not decide the fate of the masses on subjects they don't even understand. A new organization can be built from developers and tech savvy people for developers and tech savvy people. Instead of bickering on which old conformity they can shove blockchain into perhaps the discussion should be about forming a new one altogether of educated people who have a real interest in this field

[06-Oct-18 06:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @GlorymanRTS I believe we are in accumulation phrase with price being in sideways advancement, you need to adjusts both the chart and coin supply rewards knowledge to understand that. It is good we have supply increase while moving sideways, really good price action for the project to not be supply driven.


[06-Oct-18 08:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @GlorymanRTS to ease the picture, please be aware that coins bought in Jul have staked a lot of coins for its holders, way more than ones you would aquire now did. The staked blocks were having more coins in it and the staking supply was way lower than now. That justifies the price action we had. If we are moving sideways while holders are acquiring more coins with staking, that means that demand is constantly rising, because it meets the constantly increasing supply. As long as price is the same, VRSC holders are gaining value because they stake more coins, so their portfolio value increases in BTC terms and VRSC terms. As long as we are having sideways price action we are actually gaining higher value of the project itself because basically its real market cap increases due to constantly rising supply ü§û

I am finishing some last VERY exciting new capability, and I'm hoping to have all finished by the next day or so for testing and their code review.

Right now, I can say that in addition to Sapling on the October 28th activation date, we will not only be the first blockchain to combine Sapling with smart contracts, our newest update will use crypto conditions, enhanced for even more capabilities on Verus Coin, to solve some of the toughest problems in POS systems in a very elegant, scalable way.

[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> @GlorymanRTS you are not wrong in principle, it has gone down since the listing. It also went up since the low at 0.0000099 - all depends on your framing ;)

there is so much wrong with using that chart like that without context. 

currently we are basically flatlining around 2, although creeping up a little. If the project demonstrates incremental successes and there is a good reception and uptake on cryptopia, then this should be a price floor. If not, honestly I don't know how low a bearish alt can go apart from 0. I don't want to make any guesses as I'm less familiar with early alt price behaviour, but I am generally thinking it'll take some months before we get readable/tradeable market moves. At the moment it's all about your preference, risk tolerance and personal intepretation of VRSC value. Personally I never like trend following as a starting point, so if one thinks it's bearish, it's time to consider buying IMO


[07-Oct-18 03:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> other point is that volume is insanely low


[07-Oct-18 03:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> so putting much weight into the current market price isn't really a great idea


[07-Oct-18 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> I just wondered if it was worth mining for the electricity and maybe buying if it is a good investment


[07-Oct-18 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @ver_User Personally, I'm hodl'ing until we're in the top 100 on CMC - not financial advice though üòâ


[07-Oct-18 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> wishful thinking will be great if it comes true üòâ


[07-Oct-18 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> but yeah all or nothing really... start up mentality, why not


[07-Oct-18 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> maybe it would be better to mine elsewhere and invest if it had potential


[07-Oct-18 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> I'm not sure on the calculation for mining


[07-Oct-18 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> at the moment


[07-Oct-18 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> depends on your electricity, check the mining thread,  I'm sure it's been talked about


[07-Oct-18 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> for a time the rewards for mining were worth whatver you could throw at it pretty much


[07-Oct-18 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> at the moment I think it's balanced out quite a lot so buying may well be the same as mining


[07-Oct-18 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> we are talking about it, but changing price and difficulty in measuring the hash to coins makes it hard to conclude


[07-Oct-18 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> I see, I guess opportunity cost is one factor


[07-Oct-18 03:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> just buy and stake, easier decision and less management üòâ


[07-Oct-18 03:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> use auto shield script from englal


[07-Oct-18 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> the hard part is deciding what harware to buy, it the price is highish and stable then 1080 ti is good. If the price is dropping or we get less coins then its better to buy amd.


[07-Oct-18 03:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> and mine a different coin


[07-Oct-18 04:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> yeah at this stage I would just wonder what would you get if you just buy at market and stake with the same value you would have put into hardware/electricity, and then some value on the time and mental power you would have spent on the mining setup/maintenance. That's just me though


[07-Oct-18 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> could go 5050 - match your staking percentage with a an equivalent mining setup, hope for stable returns/hashrate


[07-Oct-18 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> It's good to have GPUs because you can always switch coins where it's profitable.


[07-Oct-18 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> Staking on coins is risky... because coins can go down.


[07-Oct-18 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> Yeah i agree


[07-Oct-18 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> I see coins dipped 1000 percent sometime.


[07-Oct-18 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> And if a coin goes up you can always mine the coin and make a big profit.


[07-Oct-18 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> But obviously it's not like hitting the lottery


[07-Oct-18 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> Or just sell GPUs when you don't need them anymore.


[07-Oct-18 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> I bought AMD Vega 64 when it was first came out.


[07-Oct-18 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> It was sold for $375 on Egghead.


[07-Oct-18 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> I bought two.


[07-Oct-18 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> Now, I see people still selling it for $500 on Craigslist.


[07-Oct-18 09:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Everyone is dumping their GPUs here, getting cheaper by the day.


[07-Oct-18 09:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> people are selling 970 GTXs for $100


[07-Oct-18 09:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> Old and obsolete GPUs maybe.


[07-Oct-18 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> Vega and 1080 TI still expensive.


[07-Oct-18 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> If I sell my Vega now I still make $100 in profit.


[07-Oct-18 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> I have two GTX 970s I bought for $120 and $100 USD, they mine 350 MH/s each at only 290 watts, dirt cheap and getting cheaper by the day because everyone is getting out of the GPU mining over here üòâ


[07-Oct-18 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> You're talking about 2-3 years old GPUs hahah.


[07-Oct-18 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Sophal Why are you laughing at me?


[07-Oct-18 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> It is all about ROI, not power


[07-Oct-18 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> Vega 64 and 1080 TI  about 1+ years old.


[07-Oct-18 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> I learned it's good to sell your GPUs after a year or so.


[07-Oct-18 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Best ROI at the moment is the GTX 970, don't understand why that is so funny.


[07-Oct-18 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> Then invest on newest ones.


[07-Oct-18 09:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> I used to do that... I bought 480s when people buying 580s.


[07-Oct-18 09:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> Then I bought 580s and and sold 480s... but when Vega 64 came out selling my old 480s was hard.


[07-Oct-18 09:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> Now, I set one year for old GPUs.


[07-Oct-18 09:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> Get rid of it as fast as new ones come out.


[07-Oct-18 09:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Sophal The newest are not as profitable, you can buy 3x GTX 970 for $300 now, which will mine at the same MH/s as a single GTX 1080 TI which costs $650 used, that's 2x the price for the same performance...


[07-Oct-18 09:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> Like I said sold your old ones for the same price or little higher than you bought it is not too bad.


[07-Oct-18 09:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Sophal What are you talking about "the same price or a little higher" - you pay less than half for the same performance...

[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> I bought Vega 64 for $375, it's sold online for $500 right now.


[07-Oct-18 09:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> It had good run for Ethereum and I made profit from it... still can sell higher than I bought them.


[07-Oct-18 09:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Sophal> Right now people with 1080 TI can still sell theirs for great prices... and get XTI cards.


[07-Oct-18 09:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz99> @Crupti I had a 970 build, maybe 9 months ago... While everyone was in a panic to ROI, I already had, because I spent $80-$100, for 23-25/mh


[07-Oct-18 10:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Cruz99 Yeah. Problem with newer GPU cards is that you get the high performance but the ROI is worse than the low end cards.


[07-Oct-18 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> For example, the 1050 is selling used for the same price as the 970 at 100 MH/s less when mining Verus. 1060 is 2x the price of the 970 but only has 1.5x the mining performance.


[07-Oct-18 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> So currently, the 970 has the best ROI for Verus mining and the prices keep dropping - that's at least how I see it.

[07-Oct-18 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @Crupti You are absolutely right if performance per dollar spent would be the single KPI for the mining facility. With business as a whole mindset, reselling value, warranty and performance per wat are important as well and I believe Pascal is way to go and Touring if only prices will drop or next releases will become available.

I like Verus project a lot. We are considering VerusHash algorithm for Marmara Chain. We want Marmara Coin to be mineable by normal CPUs. I personally do not want people to invest on expensive mining rigs to mine Marmara. Even It would be great if cheque writers could mine the coin. Then we can use immature balances against non-redemptions. Do we have detailed performance comparison when using pure CPUs and using same CPUs with mining rigs? Thanks!

[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Hey everyone; liking the community ethos thus far. I'm not a tech person, so indulging my ignorance: 1. what benefit I am receiving from staking VRSC on the agama wallet? And 2. On avg, how often can I expect to get a block reward from mining w the agama wallet (approx 83 mega hash/s)? And finally, 3. I'm mining/staking w agama, but also purchase from DP occasionally- do I have to update my staking each time I add more VRSC from DP, or is the TOTAL in my agama wallet automatically staked? Thanks for any answers! Really excited to see where we can go with this project. Miketout and the other devs on this team are amazing!

[dscrdvrsc] <VirtualSoundNW> 1. Staking benefit: you have a small chance to win 24 coins in the current epoch for each staked block if your wallet is staking. Reward declines in later epochs.
2. Take your hashes / network hashes to get a rough estimate of your chance to mine. 
3. If you're staking with a wallet, any public (non-Z address keyed) VerusCoins you've moved in will be staked.

[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz_77> @jimboscott You've got a future. Not sure what kind it will be, but you've got one. Very cute Kitten!!


[25-Oct-18 03:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> Better keep that kitten away from our blockchain. I hear they tend to multiply and clog up the network. Let Vitalik have them

[25-Oct-18 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <2Faze> @CryptoAlex thx which wallet is recommended to store verus? Any mobile available?


[25-Oct-18 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoAlex> @2Faze You can get the Agama GUI or CLI for desktop on the verus website. There is a mobile version for android that will be released after sapling activation (oct 28). 

miketout (lead dev) wrote about it last monday on software discussion channel:
"there is an Agama mobile wallet available for Android now, which supports Verus, and once we get past the Sapling activation, which includes pool, electrum, and lite mode updates still to happen, we will focus on completing a very nice React Native mobile wallet that is already in the works and will have a number of unique features that we believe will make a difference, can't talk about specifics quite yet or when."


[25-Oct-18 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <2Faze> Thank you man i am married with iphone so have to choose desktop wallet for now and looking forward to a mobile later! What is the differenz between GUI and CLI?


[25-Oct-18 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoAlex> GUI - Graphic User Interface
CLI - Command-LIne tool

[26-Oct-18 06:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> There is no asic for verushash


[26-Oct-18 06:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> And I can‚Äôt imagine someone diverted manufacturing/technical staff to design and spit one out in 4 months for an otherwise unknown coin


[26-Oct-18 06:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Gpu/cpu are the options


[26-Oct-18 06:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> @Hollowman9000 i agree, but how come above guys can mine with such a high hash power


[26-Oct-18 06:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> becaz of this greedy fuckers we are not getting rite


[26-Oct-18 06:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Maybe someone has privately setup an FPGA (I‚Äôll admit my ignorance, I had to go read up on what they were)

[26-Oct-18 06:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> FYI, opened Blockfolio last night and it had an update, updated to 2.0 and DP is in their system now.  Switched my Verus over to show DP prices üòÉ


[26-Oct-18 06:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> This was the version for iPhone

[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> (Not sure about android, someone want to check if the official update is out?)


[26-Oct-18 06:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cryptoprofit.zone> can some one please confirm if i deleted all my verus files in %appdata% and downloaded thenew wallet from website thats all i need to do to update, everything seems fine and ive made a transaction to shield funds from a block i mined (solomining) just a little concern that i may have it wrong as at the last change i was mining blocks on the wrong chain

[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> @John Westbrook downloaded 2.0 about 5-1/2 hours ago (iPhone)


[26-Oct-18 06:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @cryptoprofit.zone check the block number in the wallet and compare with the one in the explorer


[26-Oct-18 06:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Got DP loaded up (finally)


[26-Oct-18 06:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Nice @Hollowman9000 ! Yeah, it's nice having it all organized now üòÉ I was about to develop my own API webapp


[26-Oct-18 06:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @cryptoprofit.zone I believe that if you have successfully shielded coins and your block height is right, you should be fine üëç


[26-Oct-18 06:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @damodar you know little it seems. 400 gh/s is like ... 100 rigs of 6x1070. That means that the top miner is just a 100 rig guy. It's not even a full scale mining facility, it's just a solid mining hub. Nothing suspicious about that


[26-Oct-18 06:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> @John Westbrook it made my blockfolio a little less depressing üòÜ


[26-Oct-18 06:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Wonder what the power tradeoff is there between gpu and cpu


[26-Oct-18 06:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <2Faze> Whats the ticker for verus in blockfolio?


[26-Oct-18 06:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <etrnlgldnbraid> Yes I cant seem to find it either, although yes  @John Westbrook there was quite an overhaul on the UI


[26-Oct-18 06:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Ticker is VRSC


[26-Oct-18 06:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <etrnlgldnbraid> Oh okay I did find it now. Hopefully they add logo soon!


[26-Oct-18 06:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <2Faze> Ok thx but for VRSC the only exchange available is barterDEX... how you found DP?


[26-Oct-18 06:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Yeah, I'm writing them to request the logo refresh


[26-Oct-18 06:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> in the coins settings, in the Details tab, you have two buttuns directly below the price.  The button on the left is how you select the Exchange, you should see DigitalPrice in there.


[26-Oct-18 06:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cryptoprofit.zone> thanks @ok88  thats what i thought


[26-Oct-18 06:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> @ok88 lol for u it might be very lite. but for a small minner it is big thing bro.... vrsc should focus on high hash rate from one guy


[26-Oct-18 06:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> there should be machnism to block such high hash


[26-Oct-18 06:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> then all small miners will leave this coin soon

[26-Oct-18 06:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Update to their 2.0 on the appstore


[26-Oct-18 06:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <2Faze> I just updated it


[26-Oct-18 06:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> i feel there is big inside mining going on


[26-Oct-18 06:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> that's not the right UI


[26-Oct-18 06:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> that's the old one looks like


[26-Oct-18 06:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> somehow verus is compromised with high mining hash power

[26-Oct-18 07:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> people who run their own private pools


[26-Oct-18 07:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> @dukeleto that is veuspool.io


[26-Oct-18 07:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> not private pool


[26-Oct-18 07:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> you don't comprendo


[26-Oct-18 07:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> if u dnt know, please check above


[26-Oct-18 07:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> a private pool of hundreds/thousands of machines, that pool resources together, finally send hashrate to a public pool


[26-Oct-18 07:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> miners -> private pool -> public pool


[26-Oct-18 07:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> I am saying this as one plausible explanation. I don't know anything for sure, except ASICs for verushash most likely don't exist


[26-Oct-18 07:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <etrnlgldnbraid> I didnt see myself, but my friend said he saw 400 Th as the total network hash listed on veruspool


[26-Oct-18 07:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> much much more likely and profitable for some smart sysadmin to be using 1000 servers that sit idle all the time somewhere


[26-Oct-18 07:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> mining pools and explorers are riddled with display bugs, as well, they aren't perfect


[26-Oct-18 07:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> just because you see a graph on a webpage, doesn't make it real üòÉ


[26-Oct-18 07:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> if i was that person, i would have them pointed locally, a private pool


[26-Oct-18 07:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> then those private pools send hashrate to a public pool, as one worker


[26-Oct-18 07:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> they look like one unit, but it's actually hundreds or thousands of machines


[26-Oct-18 07:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> @dukeleto i used to get 30 vrsc after rewards reduction, but since 3 days iam getting 8vrsc


[26-Oct-18 07:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @damodar i used to get 384 blocks very often üòπ


[26-Oct-18 07:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Exactly @dukeleto


[26-Oct-18 07:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <etrnlgldnbraid> For sure, I asked him if he saw it listed elsewhere but he didnt check multiple sources. But coinciding with the spike to 60+ TH on veruspool seems ominous


[26-Oct-18 07:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> hashrate has gone up considerably, almost 10x, in the last few days


[26-Oct-18 07:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> @dukeleto now i came to know, u will be one of the person among these person


[26-Oct-18 07:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> if you keep the same hardware, your hashrate is constant, which means diminishing rewards


[26-Oct-18 07:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Could be also due to the updated ccminer


[26-Oct-18 07:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> it's basic math


[26-Oct-18 07:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> It outperforms Agama


[26-Oct-18 07:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> lololol


[26-Oct-18 07:08 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> ccminer is 70% faster, on my machines, than CLI verus. Agama is slower due to using more CPU for GUI stuff


[26-Oct-18 07:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> yup


[26-Oct-18 07:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> but that doesn't explain these large workers


[26-Oct-18 07:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> these large workers are private pools


[26-Oct-18 07:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> no, that is true


[26-Oct-18 07:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <basti> i think the 17TH is real with no asics. if every cpu gpu makes ~ 500MH its 34k units


[26-Oct-18 07:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> they take the hashrate of 1000 machines and make it look like a single working in a public pool


[26-Oct-18 07:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> it's more efficient that way, better for the miner. just makes sense


[26-Oct-18 07:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> why have 10,000 computers going over the public internet to tell a mining pool server something, when instead, they can all talk on blazing fast local network and only 1 or a few machines send data to the public pool


[26-Oct-18 07:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> makes it much less visible in network stats, too üòπ


[26-Oct-18 07:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> this guy @dukeleto giving his schooling maths n puzzles.... he is big hasher as i mentioned above.


[26-Oct-18 07:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> maybe one day, but I am an old skool miner you could say


[26-Oct-18 07:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> I only haz 1 GH/s currently, those big miners are not me


[26-Oct-18 07:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> but they are easily explained by private pools on university/company networks


[26-Oct-18 07:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> many CPUs can do ~1 GH/s, that is 17000 machines to get 17 TH/s. law schools would be perfect, they always have the very best computers


[26-Oct-18 07:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> each working is smaller tho, 400 GH/s worker could be 800 500 MH/s computers


[26-Oct-18 07:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <etrnlgldnbraid> How do I do that at my work without anyone knowing üòÇ


[26-Oct-18 07:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> machines that are on the same physical LANs make sense to batch together as one worker


[26-Oct-18 07:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> only u guys mine this coin, i dnt want mine at lose bro.... let stop mining is gud, instead of giving my hash for no use


[26-Oct-18 07:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> every coins are taking by fuckers like high hash power gives, n killing small miners


[26-Oct-18 07:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> please, stop mining, the hashrate will go down....


[26-Oct-18 07:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> ya u guys can get more coins... such a greedy fucker u are all


[26-Oct-18 07:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <etrnlgldnbraid> Higher hashrate means a more secure network, ideally. So its bittersweet. Buy some VRSC instead.


[26-Oct-18 07:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> @etrnlgldnbraid lol yes exactly, its centralised with high hash power guys


[26-Oct-18 07:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> u know how coin price increases


[26-Oct-18 07:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @damodar i don't think you understand what centralized means


[26-Oct-18 07:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> only with adaption of investors


[26-Oct-18 07:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> all the coins are resides in few wallets means... no price increase


[26-Oct-18 07:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> it need to scatter, then only price will increase


[26-Oct-18 07:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> just learn that


[26-Oct-18 07:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> if it resides in few wallets , price will get dumped on one day


[26-Oct-18 07:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <etrnlgldnbraid> Are you complaining about centralized supply or centralized hashrate


[26-Oct-18 07:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> centralised hashrate


[26-Oct-18 07:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <etrnlgldnbraid> I think the hashrate could be more of a concern, if the recent spikes to 60 and 400 TH are somehow real.

[dscrdvrsc] <etrnlgldnbraid> https://www.crypto-coinz.net/recommended-crypto-pools-for/?204-Verus-VRSC-VerusHash-mining-pools/


[26-Oct-18 07:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <etrnlgldnbraid> Unless we assume the Unknown workers here are just one address then it seems pretty decentralized to me


[26-Oct-18 07:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> i would not assume that page takes into account solo miners correctly


[26-Oct-18 07:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <etrnlgldnbraid> But yes we went from 3-4 TH to 16-17 pretty quickly. That does make the network less vulnerable

[26-Oct-18 07:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> but bad for small miners

[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> greedy fuckers


[26-Oct-18 07:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <etrnlgldnbraid> @damodar when the network is more secure, your coin is more valuable. I would rather have this large hashrate support the network than be smallest and have a successful adversarial attack.


[26-Oct-18 07:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> looks like a sick pac man


[26-Oct-18 07:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <etrnlgldnbraid> Is that a pool? I thought it was solo miners


[26-Oct-18 07:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> 62% hashrate is most like solo miners + small + private pools


[26-Oct-18 07:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <damodar> i hope this might be private pools


[26-Oct-18 07:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> and i repeat, most websites incorrectly take into account solo miners in mining pool % stats

[dscrdvrsc] <michaeltoutjr> @Gameoverzoin Hi, shielding shouldn't have any effect on how your coins are stored in your wallet, even before shielding, you have the keys to your coins so quitting the wallet shouldn't lose them. It is possible however, that you were on a fork before and you are now on the main chain, so you don't have the funds you had from the fork


[26-Oct-18 11:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @Gameoverzoin b-addresses tend to be tricky for agama, try to use cli for shielding every one of them separately


[26-Oct-18 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Gameoverzoin you can try as ok88 says. i can help in a few hours. I am sure we should be able to solve it without an issue. @Hollowman9000, I have confirmed, pending full testing of the fix, that staking transactions are not added to the wallet until rescan, making it look to the wallet that the amount has left addresses under your control, though it hasn't. I expect an update with the fix and a very good cheat catcher out later today or tomorrow, just in time for the Sapling and cheat catching to take effect.

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Hollowman9000 you are right, and I am going to announce shortly. all the software protocols and transitions are looking good. the new update with your fix is on its way, and the work on pools and the Electrum server is shaping up so that activation should be quite smooth across the network. I made a mistake on the activation block number, and though I was able to confirm all other changes, testing to see that it activates on a specific date wasn't really an option as much as just not making the error to begin with. The good news is that the working protocol was released some time ago, a new point release with solid cheat catching is imminent, and we get a couple more days for everyone to be ready.

[27-Oct-18 06:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Zec doesn‚Äôt even have electrum support for z-transactions yet, do they?


[27-Oct-18 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Maybe I should clarify the announcement. Our Electrum now supports Sapling, and even transparent transactions are different in a number of ways. It doesn't have the full support for z-transactions that I believe is necessary for a good experience. Theoretically, you could send z-transactions through it, but there's more support needed to find them in your wallet, which will extend the API in a non-trivial way. We just didn't find ANY support for Sapling, even transparent txes, in any of the Electrum forks.
BTW, your issue is completely fixed in the coming update, and we're trying to make sure we have everything ready before release, as it includes the much better cheat catcher and a fix for the non-latin user names as well. the foundation is considering running some cheat tests  after activation which when foiled, will allow miners and stakers to make something on the cheats that the foundation tests.
Should I update the announcement?

[27-Oct-18 07:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Total coin supply, including locked and unlocked is available in the spreadsheet above. I wouldn't say it is a solution that Ethereum wasn't capable of. They haven't done it yet in production. No one that we know of has, and Ethereum's plans to solve it take a different philosophical approach, which ends up with a more complex implementation plan. Verus has a working, elegant, released solution for solving the POS nothing-at-stake problem, which will activate at block 227520 along with Zcash Sapling support.
Probably the best place now to learn about Verus coin is on the project Medium https://medium.com/veruscoin. @benohanlon wrote a great introduction, including public blockchains as a service (PBaaS) in the Pocket Guide, and @John Westbrook 's articles on the nothing-at-stake solution and Sapling give a great overview of what makes VerusCoin different today.

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Only in the Verus enhanced Agama on veruscoin.io right now. it also supports lite mode and other Komodo coins. we have an update in the works right now that should be out tomorrow


[27-Oct-18 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Phantaruk7 I'm not sure about that. You might check the mining channel. I would expect 24 skylake cores to do better than that. if it's a multicore bottleneck issue, you could try a few instances of 6 cores each or the nheqminer, just to see if that's the issue.


[27-Oct-18 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Phantaruk7> Multicore bottleneck means that the Miner cant handle ALL the cores power and the performance goes down?


[27-Oct-18 08:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it means that there may be a frequently updated shared memory location that requires bus locking and/or spin locks. on few cores, this may be a very small amount of the total overhead, but as the cores increase, it can't scale, and eventually, synchronization consumes a large part of the overhead. in the wallet and nheqminer, i made sure multiple cores would not have this issue. Chris's ccminer beats my loop by interleaving 4 hashes at once, but if there is a multicore bottleneck, that will takeover at some point and nheqminer would win above a certain number of cores. alternately, you can take advatage of the speed in ccminer and divide your cores among multiple instances that don't share the same synchronization objects


[27-Oct-18 08:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Phantaruk7> Oh i see, is there any tutorial for this nheqminer? @miketout


[27-Oct-18 08:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> There are releases and some instructions here: https://github.com/VerusCoin/nheqminer/releases
I still think you may do better running multiple instances of ccminer to split up the cores

[27-Oct-18 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Phantaruk7> @miketout  ok if i run multiple instances how much cores do you recommend?


[27-Oct-18 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> you can try one instance at 4 or 6 to see what the performance is, and if it scales to the value you're seeing at 24. if not, you can choose 6 instances at 4 cores or the other way around, I would suspect. i would like to know if after running the test of 6 cores, it is much faster per core than at 24.

[27-Oct-18 09:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> that should be accurate and the ccminer when running without core contention should be at least 50% better

[dscrdvrsc] <mavenL> Why everyone calculate market cap wrongly? Isn‚Äôt market cap = circulation supply x price? Circulation supply doesn‚Äôt include timelocked coins.


[28-Oct-18 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mavenL> Circulating supply right now ~10 mil, price ~$0.5, market cap should be around 5 mil.

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @John Westbrook cant wait. Would love to know more on this subject. Thanks!


[29-Oct-18 12:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <LocoMB> Morning! Just to be sure, I should ask:
can I keep using Komodo Agama wallet or rather the seed and wifkey for my VERUSCOIN exported with Agama?
the reason why I ask is that Ihave not quite yet understood whether VERUS is a full Komodo clone that will at some point diverge from Komodo or whether it will remain in the same scope of keyspaces... ‚ùî üåê


[29-Oct-18 12:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <LocoMB> and how does the wallet on VRS website:
Agama-linux-x64-v0.4.0a.tar.gz
relate to Agama 43c?


[29-Oct-18 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Hi, and welcome to the community! Here was my answer on Bitcointalk:
You can still use the same seed and WIF key for both wallets and all Komodo family coins. Verus is not really a clone as much as a friendly fork with its own technology and features. At the same time, we intend to remain compatible with Komodo as an ecosystem coin, meaning we intend to remain compatible with formats and share technologies. Sapling keys, for example are not supported yet in Komodo, but when they are, they will be compatible, as we will work with Komodo to integrate compatible changes. We have our own work on Verus Enhanced Agama, and though we expect a lot of our changes to be picked up by Komodo's Agama, they are also making changes, so there is not 100% overlap. We do pick up changes from them and vice versa. We will either converge changes more regularly or rebrand our version of the GUI wallet at some point with attribution. Until then, you should consider them generally compatible with feature differences, and you will need the Verus enhanced wallet to run Verus.

We are working on a Verus Branded, React Native mobile wallet as well, which will also be compatible with the same seeds and WIF keys. Until that is released, we recommend using the Agama or Pungo wallet on mobile.


[29-Oct-18 11:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SadykovT> Pungo is very user-friendly interface, enjoy, suggest.


[29-Oct-18 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'm just curious and for all I know it might not even be possible but is there any way for something someday to be integrated into the agama wallet that so many coins share and use something like the crypto conditions so that as long as conditions are met by both parties it would be possible to make trades between two totally different coins without an exchange or third party? Probably very complicated but itd be nice if someday it were that simple for two users to trade different coins easily amongst themselves

[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @Godballz you mean an atomic swap? KMD already have it on barterdex

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Daira Thanks for stopping by, and thank you for all your work on Zcash and Sapling! We'd also be happy to discuss and/or share work that we're doing on extending some Sapling functions to include smart transactions, proof of stake solutions, or otherwise. We're activating at block 227520. We've got the pools and Electrum servers updated, and it looks like everything is ready.
BTW, we have an updated Electrum server and wallet that supports Zcash lite mode for transparent Sapling transactions, and we are also looking at lite mode z-transaction solutions. We'd be happy to collaborate if you have interest.

[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Will we have a choice on whether we want to generate a sprout or a sapling z address, post-fork, or will it be sapling-only from here on out? @miketout


[30-Oct-18 06:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Hollowman9000 you can generate addresses the same before and after. You will still need to specify ‚Äúsapling‚Äù after the fork to get a sapling address.

[31-Oct-18 04:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> trolling is something that should be studied more. not for the hate that is spread, let me be clear on that. i hate hate

[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> i dont think theres any argueing with trolls. the only thing i know to stop somebody who is convinced that "X is Y" is to convince him otherweise.


[31-Oct-18 04:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> and i dont see how you would do that - especially in filterbubble-land


[31-Oct-18 04:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <benohanlon> It leaves me a little exasperated when the only thing he has to comment is something pointlessly negative and hostile when he prob has 0% idea of verus whatsoever...


[31-Oct-18 04:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> i would actually assume he _has_ an idea of verus. often times, when you have no meaningful weapons left, you would go unfair.


[31-Oct-18 04:39 AM] Gateway#3763

[31-Oct-18 04:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> my first impression on the komodo discord i remember was not as smooth as the experience new users will get in here. and no troll on earth probably can stop this.

[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> i just now notice, reddit labels you as a crypto god


[31-Oct-18 04:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> whats the metric for that? (nothing inbetween the lines here, i just wonder about this metric)


[31-Oct-18 05:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> let me build up my monologue even further. @benohanlon i'm under the impression that this 'hianone' account is under a lot of other komodo/verus related posts with a similar tone to it


[31-Oct-18 05:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <benohanlon> not sure but i am pretty godly


[31-Oct-18 05:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <benohanlon> to be fair it may be a special label just for me?

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I don't understand people down voting something without any comment. It's like reading a newspaper article on the subway and giving thumbs down to the stranger next to you


[31-Oct-18 05:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> oh well, it wouldn't be the first time something like this happened to me in real life, or at least witnessing something similar.


[31-Oct-18 05:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> a wrong tshirt, a wrong newspaper, frickin' SITTING the wrong god damned way can trigger people to way worse reactions than just a thumbdown gesture


[31-Oct-18 05:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> for example: a a german, being a bald head with a long (nerdy) beard, wearing exclusively black and having a favour for proper boots (over sneakers) will definitely be enough to trigger a nazi comment

[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> One way to quiet trolls is to just demonstrate what we are really about...like strong community, innovative and forward-thinking development, strong leadership and brilliant coding by example from lead dev @miketout, I could go on üòÉ


[31-Oct-18 06:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> i agree

[31-Oct-18 06:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> All those who are interested and excited to hear the news immediately came to check out the project and didn't have time to comment on reddit.  It's like when you read a column in the paper that you totally love but writing a letter to the editor either falls through the cracks or you don't think of doing it, you just sort of enjoy it.


[31-Oct-18 06:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Plus people just upvote, commenting praise is hard and your history follows you.  It's more acceptible to create a history of snark on reddit...if you are positive the guy like that comes out and criticizes you (like he did @benohanlon ) for having a history of being positive!


[31-Oct-18 06:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Sort of funny and a touch immature.  @benohanlon you clever bastard always ready to go to bat and demonstrate strength of position and rooted in intelligence and maturity.  My brotha!


[31-Oct-18 06:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Good points. When your brand new drone breaks, first thing you do is go complain on Amazon but when it works perfectly well who has time for reviews when you can fly


[31-Oct-18 06:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> sounds like personal experience talking haha


[31-Oct-18 06:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> By the way and I don't know how frowned upon this might be but if you have a VPN I found that you can vote for verus as many times as you want..


[31-Oct-18 06:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I actually don't have much interest in drones don't even know why I picked that to be honest haha


[31-Oct-18 06:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> But I agree with that concept


[31-Oct-18 06:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> I'd like to add to Godballz example from above: when your brand new drone breaks, nowadays, you go out to seek the error everywhere, but not in the fact that you missed to correctly tie down the fucking propellers.

[31-Oct-18 06:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> So what you're saying is that the trolls need to look inward?


[31-Oct-18 06:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> It's not my preference in crypto projects that's getting your panties all bunched up, you're just a hurt soul that's crying out for help in the form of negative ignorant Reddit comments


[31-Oct-18 06:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'd like to make a complaint. Those damn sapling transactions are way too fast. So what, now anybody and their mother can send private Z transactions anytime they want?


[31-Oct-18 06:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> The couple of posts I put up about verus have been downvoted almost instantly. I'm wondering if they are even finished reading the title before they start clicking away.


[31-Oct-18 06:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> We will find those same trolls in the trading section soon enough wishing they listened

[31-Oct-18 07:26 AM] Gateway#3763

[31-Oct-18 07:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Haha. Nicely stated. Very much in the spirit of anybody's fault but mine. The reddit trolls would be proud


[31-Oct-18 07:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Curious though. How could that be an issue?


[31-Oct-18 07:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> for example, if you depend on the duration of some operation

[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Or did you at any point?


[31-Oct-18 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> @John Westbrook @miketout 
1. once we have the changes from verus merged to komodod, would be possible to make 50% verusPoS and 50% Equihash PoW assetchain ?


[31-Oct-18 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> That's definitely a @miketout and @jl777c question üòÉ


[31-Oct-18 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> yep, asked James already, and he pointed me to mike üòõ


[31-Oct-18 09:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> I have further question too once that's answered üòÅ


[31-Oct-18 09:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> okay, putting number to questions.


[31-Oct-18 09:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> 2. Assuming once it's merged to komodo code, later it'd be possible to add different mining algorithms to chose an option for assetchains, like scrypt, x11, etc. etc. Not entirely sure how hard or easy it might be, but I'm sure it is possible.
So, assuming other algorithms are also supported to be configured to make an assetchain, will verusPoS be supported with those other PoW algorithems?
If not, then can you please give a bit detail why verusPoS would be specific to verusPoW ?


[31-Oct-18 09:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> uh, good questions


[31-Oct-18 09:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> eager to see the answers really


[31-Oct-18 09:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> @jl777c may be you can partially answer the second question too?


[31-Oct-18 09:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> Okay, continuing on just assumptions... üòÑ


[31-Oct-18 09:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> 3. So, let's assume verusPoS will be possible to use with other PoW algo to create an assetchain, does that mean that the same Nothing-at-Stake problem is solved with those assetchains created with this combination of 50% verusPoS and 50% otherPoW algo? Am I getting it correct?


[31-Oct-18 09:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (veruspool.xyz)> i think you are (disclaimer: thinking is bad)


[31-Oct-18 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> the PoW side of PoS/PoW wont affect the PoS side much


[31-Oct-18 09:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> meaning how can the blockhash function specifics invalidate the N@S solution?


[31-Oct-18 09:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> for the PoW blocks


[31-Oct-18 09:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> cant say its impossible, but it seems highly unlikely

[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Hey - what does a cheat catcher payment look like in the GUI wallet?


[31-Oct-18 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I think I got one, but not certain.


[31-Oct-18 11:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> The end result was a 24 VRSC block to a T address that has never been used in my wallet.


[31-Oct-18 11:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> if you don't have a -pubkey set, all block rewards go to a new taddr


[31-Oct-18 11:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> But I thought all staking rewards went to the address that holds the staking UTXO?


[31-Oct-18 11:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I am not mining.  Just staking and set up for cheat catcher blocks.


[31-Oct-18 11:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> So, this was a cheat catch it would seem...


[31-Oct-18 11:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mavenL> @jimboscott known bug, check #community-support


[31-Oct-18 11:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mavenL> Staking reward right now create new t-address


[31-Oct-18 11:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> But, the staking reward also involved a Z address as well...


[31-Oct-18 11:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Never seen that before


[31-Oct-18 11:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I cannot upgrade right now - OK to leave alone for a few hours?


[31-Oct-18 11:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Why would a normally staked block get a Z address involved?


[31-Oct-18 11:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> A few answers @jimboscott @John Westbrook @grewalsatinder  @dukeleto :
1. We have identified a few small issues while running under Sapling on mainnet. None of them are serious, and we will address all in the next few days. The relevant one here is that currently all stakes are being delegated to a new address that would have been the address when you are mining. Until the next update, POS does not respect -pubkey and will payout to new addresses as if mining without pubkey
2. The code base should allow Equihash + VerusPOS after integration. Someone would have to do some work and understand the new chain power rules to add other POW algorithms, but VerusPOS doesn't really know or care what the specific POW algorithm is.


[31-Oct-18 11:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Thanks for the update @miketout, really enjoying the incredible performance improvements and great that everything has transitioned so smoothly, I know that's not by accident, very deliberately outstanding and devoted dev work by you and the other devs here.  Kudos.

[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Welcome to the community @verz36!

[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @miketout What was really different about the block I saw come in was the fact that it had a Z address as part of the chain of transactions.  I have never seen that before.  There were 4 wallet entries.  From the first to last, it was a known T address IN of 300, a Z address in of 0, a T address OUT of 300, then the block reward to a new T address.  All at the same block height.


[31-Oct-18 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoAlex> @jimboscott Happened to me today. AFAIK, StakeGuard works is by spending the cheater coins when they mature to your cheat catch S-address, so my conclusion is that the immature coins that go to a T-address can't be the result of cheat catch and are just a regular stake. I have no idea why the Z-transaction is there, though


[31-Oct-18 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @jimboscott right. the issue is that the OP_RETURN of the stake transaction is showing up as a 0 amount transaction and because Agama doesn't know the destination (there is none), it assumes unknown Z. for the point release, I am adding information to the transactions that indicate whether they are stake transactions, mined coinbases, or minted coinbases. getting this information took more API calls before than it will after this change. Verus Agama will use this to collapse all the stake ins and outs into one, obvious "stake" transaction that shows the amount. We also expect to differentiate between mined and minted.


[31-Oct-18 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ethacetin> Quick question: is all that weirdness w/digitalprice settled? If I deposit some BTC to DP it should be all good, right?


[31-Oct-18 04:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @ethacetin Digital price had a couple day delay at the change to 0.4.0 where they needed to update the wallet. They did so, came to the Discord and apologized for the delay, then completed all pending transactions. All has been fine since. I know of no issues with or complaints about their exchange at this time


[31-Oct-18 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ethacetin> Thank you.


[31-Oct-18 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoAlex> @miketout Blocktype on TxID Info already has the minted or mined information


[31-Oct-18 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> but not in listtransactions


[31-Oct-18 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> and calling gettransaction on every transaction is expensive


[01-Nov-18 01:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Etherion> thanks for reminder on the  https://txbit.io/Coin


[01-Nov-18 01:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Etherion> just voted 4 times again


[01-Nov-18 01:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Etherion> it is a good idea to remind us all. maybe twitter


[01-Nov-18 01:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Etherion> i would vote more but it seems they log the ip and the pc


[01-Nov-18 01:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Etherion> so swthcing proxy/isp does not help much.


[01-Nov-18 01:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Etherion> anyone found a work arround other than using VPS?


[01-Nov-18 01:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Etherion> i tried vpn and other browsers


[01-Nov-18 01:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Etherion> Atlant (ATL) is at +10K


[01-Nov-18 01:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Etherion> nearly dubble ours


[01-Nov-18 01:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Etherion> bots?


[01-Nov-18 01:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yeah VPN and incognito do work. Guess they haven't prevented it properly so if it's an option and others may be doing it then I'd say VPN away. Voted a few good votes as well


[01-Nov-18 01:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> A few VPN IPs were burnt so someone else was using the same one doing the same thing prob


[01-Nov-18 01:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Etherion> Atlant (ATL) is at +10K


[01-Nov-18 01:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Etherion> could be them


[01-Nov-18 01:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Etherion> small script that burns throught ISP ip's and give you or a team of pl the CAPTCHA  when asked will do the trick


[01-Nov-18 01:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Etherion> cleaver move from txbit  though. just the organic exposure for them would justify this campaign


[01-Nov-18 01:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That damn captcha was the only thing holding me back from doing more. That thing is a pain in the ass and doesn't seem to be working right. I don't even know if they want me to select the street lights including the poles am I supposed to select the squares that have just a tiny bit of the streetlight protruding into them? Why wouldn't they simply put street lights in one picture and nothing in the next


[01-Nov-18 01:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Etherion> sometimes there is just not a right answer


[01-Nov-18 01:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Etherion> kind of the idea i would think. slow pl down to a hassle so that it is hit and miss


[01-Nov-18 01:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Sounds like a metaphor for life Confucius


[01-Nov-18 01:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Hah


[01-Nov-18 01:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yeah maybe there's a reason for it or the captcha just sucks

[01-Nov-18 05:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SadykovT> Nvidia 1080ti


[01-Nov-18 05:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <basti> You can already Signup for txbit at https://beta.txbit.io/Signup The exchange looks good. We are second place of the Votingüí™


[01-Nov-18 06:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Matterbridge honestly I'd say a threadripper 1950x or 2950x for price/performance and power use. For gpu 1080 ti is powerful and efficient while Vega 64 may edge out in MH/s but uses more power. For efficiency I've heard 1070ti. In my case I find it best to limit power to 80% or less while giving a decent overclock

[01-Nov-18 08:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rhaz01> @Godballz you are correct, I own both 1080ti and 1070ti and the 1070ti is more efficient. I would argue that it is the most efficient mining card ( not taking into account the rtx cards )


[01-Nov-18 08:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rhaz01> however having less gpus is better and less of a headache, so I would chose the 1080ti's if I had to add more cards


[01-Nov-18 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Good point. Is there any data yet on rtx cards hashrate and efficiency?

[01-Nov-18 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoAlex> They will appear on your wallet listed with other transactions but at the current network hashrate the probability of a regular computer solo mine a block is very low. Solo mining is a game of chance/probability


[01-Nov-18 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoAlex> @verz36 If you want a more consistent and regular reward for your efforts, try minning #pools


[01-Nov-18 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <verz36> oh, i was thinking i was going to be able to mine 1 coin at least for 24 hours


[01-Nov-18 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I'm just popping in between compiles, and I see the discussion on multisig. Since we have stake delegation, the challenge with stake pooling is one of trusting the stakers to actually submit when they are requested to provide a winning stake. can someone explain how multisig will help us solve a problem like that? thanks


[02-Nov-18 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> I figured he was asking for multiple signers to move a tx


[02-Nov-18 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the stake tx is bound to the block being staked in a number of ways, and in order to prove it is a valid stake, the original UTXO, which is almost always going to be in an individual's wallet will need to be spent to an address that might as well be the individual again. right now, all of an individual's UTXOs are stakeable without being blocked for use. if someone can explain how we might use multisig to improve something about the security of pooling, i would have something to consider. right now, i'm not clear how it will help

[dscrdvrsc] <mykdark> hi all


[02-Nov-18 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mykdark> how high is the supply of vrsc? not find it


[02-Nov-18 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> from the last FAQ in the FAQ-chosen channel, you can see this spreadsheet link, contributed by @Cragorn : https://www.dropbox.com/s/yvclqq98j8nxdmg/Verus_POS.xlsx?dl=0
If you download it and enter the blockheight, you will see max staking coins, which is actually the circulating supply. The total supply on the explorer is both time locked and unlocked, so it is the max staking coins + time locked coins that must unlock before staking. the spreadsheet calculates unlocking as well

[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> VerusCoin is still not listed on CMC, even though it checks all their requirements:
- Must be a cryptocurrency or a crypto token. 
- Must be on a public exchange with an API that reports the last traded price and the last 24 hour trading volume. 
- Must have a non-zero trading volume on at least one supported exchange so a price can be determined. 
- For market cap ranking, an accurate circulating supply figure is required.
If you'd like to have a cryptocurrency listed and it meets all of the criteria, please fill out the request form.
 
Perhaps @miketout or someone else from the team needs to fill in the CMC request form? https://coinmarketcap.com/request/

[dscrdvrsc] <jbates58> @miketout 

The multi sig was more for a public pooled staking thing we are doing.

A few of the members from the Ginasis Pool, had a private thing going, where we all sent our verus yo a single wallet, therefore increasing its balance, and therefore, the likelihood that we would get more blocks from the POS.

However, we are looking to now take it public due to the fantastic results the 10 of us achieved from out private pool.

We did it to help even out some of the randomness, and to create another stream of income from out combined efforts. I personally was the one responsible for keeping track of the eearnings and the fair and even distribution to the participants, based in their contribution amount into the pool.


We at Ginasis, recognize that there needs to be a MASSIVE level of trust in that you need to sent your verus yo someone, whom you have likley never met, and at the end of the day, there is nothing to stop them stealing it from you. This was an issue for us in our private group aswell, where a few members had met eachother face to face, but as we are all from a few different states in australia, we havent all met. However, we all had a go, and a bit of trust, and it just escalated from there, out first pooled week was about 12k verus. And our highest week was nearly 30k.

The multisig was mentioned as a way of preventing having never met people from been an issue, as it would require 2 or more separate people to sign off on the TX out of the combined pool wallet, so, if you can have that, it can then be used to instill a huge layer of trust, as you could have a few of the high standing members in the verus community as authorized signatories to send anything out of the wallet.

I hope that makes sense. And I hope you see the value in multisig. But i understand it's not needed for most things.

Apparantly, it is supported, and we are looking into it. But we are not 100% certain of this, and we are by no means coders of any sort.

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @EvilRabbit As per a conversation I saw in another channel, CoinMarketCap on their application requires TWO exchanges that support CoinMarketCap. Luckily, we now have STEX and Cryptopia should be soon. Once that happens, we meet all requirements, and hopefully it will be quick

[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @miketout That would be great; CMC is the 380th most visited website worldwide according to Alexia https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/coinmarketcap.com , and the most visited crypto website by far, even bitcoin.com ranks far behind at 8,150. I think it would mean a lot for VerusCoin adoption to be seen on CMC.

[dscrdvrsc] <ethacetin> Thanks, just wanted to make sure I was doing it right. I've never staked anything before (only mined). 
I looked through the #staking section here and I see the reason why I haven't earned any rewards yet is because I haven't been staking enough for long enough. 
But thank you both for assuring me that native is the right way.


[04-Nov-18 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ethacetin> If you all are so kind to answer some more n00b questions though, I made an SPV wallet first, and have my seed phrase written down, but never did anything more with that. 
Then I went into native mode, because I wanted to mine (and this is where transferred all the VRSC I bought, because I wanted to stake it). 
Are these the same wallets? 
For example, if I installed Agama on a different computer (or something happened where this computer died), could I restore the balance iny native mode wallet with that seed phrase?
Or do I have to make sure my .dat file I stored somewhere else to recover the balance in Native mode?


[04-Nov-18 09:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ethacetin> I think I answered my own question again, derp. I just signed into SPV with seed phrase, and it shows a different public address and 0 balance. 
So clearly they are different wallets. 
Just to double-check, to safeguardy VRSC balance in Native Mode wallet, I just need a copy of the .dat file backed up elsewhere, right?


[04-Nov-18 09:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Yep


[04-Nov-18 09:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> %appdata%/komodo/VRSC folder you will find your wallet.dat file you need to keep a backup üëçüèº

[04-Nov-18 10:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> You can import your seed phrase to your native wallet and send your balance to the SPV address, which would then be in both

[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Hey everyone, how do I back up my agama/vrsc wallet.dat file on mac? The 1st time I opened it, I got an error msg saying there was no program available to open the file with, so I chose text edit, and now when I double click on the wallet.dat file, a window with a bunch of gibberish pops up. Anyway, is the file still valid? And how do I back it up? Thanks.


[04-Nov-18 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'm not really familiar with Mac but it sounds like you Associated that file type with a text program


[04-Nov-18 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> You probably want to clear that Association the wallet.dat is just something that you want to save and it is used by the agama wallet

[06-Nov-18 10:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @mikeydof3 lite mode is fast to load, but it doesn‚Äôt support z-transactions. You‚Äôll need to run the wallet in native mode to get a sapling address. You can export your lite mode private key and import that or the pass phrase directly into your native mode wallet, so you have it there as well


[06-Nov-18 10:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mikeydof3> @miketout  so i need a coin to activate it  a komodo coin is that correct


[06-Nov-18 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> No. If you have the Verus enhanced Agama, it supports Verus in native mode. It sounds like you might not have Agama from https://veruscoin.io . Komodo Agama only supports Verus in lite mode

[dscrdvrsc] <Brett B> Got my wallet set up in native mode. Can anyone tell me the easiest way to view/save my private key. Having trouble finding it. Should I be looking for a seed phrase?


[08-Nov-18 10:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @Brett B z_exportwallet exports all keys in plain text so I believe it would be easiest that way if you need them loud and clear. You fill find the description of how to use z_exportwallet in #faq-chosen. In Agama, you can just copy the private key to clipboard using the three dots in Receive tab, next to every address too!


[08-Nov-18 10:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @Brett B Other easy way for Agama would be just using the Config menu, Wallet.dat keys

[08-Nov-18 10:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> If you leave the space empty - you will receive a complate list of all R addresses and their keys. That will skip the z-addresses though.


[08-Nov-18 10:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Brett B> Thx ok88! So the WIF code on the right side are the private keys? I found the ones correlated with my public address. Why does it list so many addresses?


[08-Nov-18 10:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> It should list 100 addresses that are in your keypool. When you created your wallet, you got all of those assigned, and they are yours. This is because Verus uses default keypool size of 100 (just like zcash), which means when your wallet gets created, 100 R-addresses are generated just for you and stored in the wallet. If you solo mine, your rewards will eventually land on those addresses. Thats just how the wallet is designed, it starts with 100 semi-hidden addresses despite showing you just one in Agama Receive tab. WIF is not exacly a private key, it's a way to present them in a nice way so that they could be easily copied and moved around. But it translates to you private key indeed, its just another way of representing your original private key. Check up https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Wallet_import_format

[08-Nov-18 10:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> Every Verus wallet now and in the future until our doom's day will be able to use WIF keys instead of the private keys so do not worry about that, you might want to just know that private key is not exacly WIF

[dscrdvrsc] <dude> what is the current/max supply of vrsc ? coingecko has no info about it


[10-Nov-18 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mavenL> @dude Miket posted this few days ago ‚Äî‚Äî right now there are 10,221,800 coins in circulation and another 23,952,699 that were mined and staked time-locked and will release uniformly at about 23-24 coins per block average over the next one year and 23 months or so

[11-Nov-18 09:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Brett B> @ok88  I have my Agama wallet set up and have the WIF addresses on file.  When I try to *import multiple keys from a second computer by pasting ALL the keys on file. I get several *wallet addresses imported notification, however my balance still shows 0 and I haven't gained access to any of my wallets. Am I missing something? Trying to enable mining/staking access from a 2nd computer.


[11-Nov-18 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @Brett B you should never stake on more than 1 machine. The best way to copy keys from machine to machine is z_exportwallet and then z_importwallet. I believe you are not using that, but some GUI feature that I have little experience with. But I believe that feature you would like to use needs other kind of an input than you have provided. Can you show which gui import feature you try to use? I will try to check correct format it needs

[dscrdvrsc] <Brett B> I was just clicking on import key at the top of wallet then *import multiple keys

[11-Nov-18 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> I believe it is better to use cli for z_import/export. For GUI if you import WIF you should need to restart and rescan when importing

[11-Nov-18 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Gmoney Our next technical/project focus for release of new capabilities is mobile, and we have actually already released some pretty amazing technology that is new and neither well understood nor yet accepted as the advance I believe it is by the crypto community.
Not sure if you know who Emin Gun Sirer is or have noticed this:
https://twitter.com/VerusCoin/status/1060740979714486272
I see his offer to render an opinion on a proof sketch of our consensus algorithms a big opportunity for Verus Coin recognition.

As a community project with fair launch and no ICO, we don't pour money into marketing, and I believe that our path to success in the long run is to build, rather than talk about, better solutions and a more secure and scalable system that proves itself in the real world and with real use cases over time.  To make progress, our focus so far has been on creating the platform solutions that lay the foundation for each next step, but we have not devoted resources to academically/formally proving the systems we have invented beyond proving their correctness to ourselves, advisers, and other community members. Before now, we considered formalizing such proofs as time and energy that may not actually benefit the project more than building the next advance or solution. With Emin Gun Sirer, one of the most respected experts in fintech and crypto, willing to look at our proof sketch when it's finished, we've added that as a high priority item to the work list, and it will take some work to complete. I'm actually very excited about that as our first real opportunity to get broad recognition for our real contributions to improving fundamental consensus algorithms. The people who will be paying attention to his opinions are experts who others pay attention to and represent many orders of magnitude more investment capital than the entire Verus market cap, I'm sure.

[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> @miketout thanks for your detailed responce. I'm always excited to see Verus tackling the real issues of crypto (as there are many). It may take some time, however eventually with continuous forward momentum in this regard, the VRSC team will be recognized as some of the leaders in crypto tech. While everyone else is barley keeping pace with upstream, Verus continues to push to the front. Always impressed, keep up the good work.


[11-Nov-18 07:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yeah  @miketout ! I'm sure many of us support the technological advances and many more support your vision of the future. Where so many others like to talk, you and your team consistently lay down solid work, pushing not only this project forward but the field itself. The great cryptographers before you would be proud. Looking forward to the advances in mobile and whatever else!

[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I would say if you want to be involved in a truly legit and innovative project/ coin , verus is a very good choice , there are other coins out there that are also worth going for , but iv got a good feeling about verus , and its not just for its profits , although they are nice too .


[14-Nov-18 03:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> There are lots of crypto‚Äôs out there today that boast they are amazing and everyone should mine them but , sadly alot of them are not that good, from what iv learnt about verus project, it has got some truly new and fascinating qualities to it , which for me say its well worth getting involved in .

[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> I think Verus needs the mempool fix for CC activated chains from KMD ... whne syncing it the debug.log is flooding with joinsplit errors


[14-Nov-18 04:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> its not harmful ... but I fixed this in KMD, i beleive ... or maybe its theother way around, either case I think that zts should not be being added to the mempool on sync.... its only supposed to be for CC vout txs.

[14-Nov-18 07:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> @Matterbridge theres not many results posted for i7 6700k as of late with the newest miners ( ccminerv3) , people posted months ago when they where solo mining that they where getting roughly 200mh/s , i would guess with the new ccminerv3 you could double that hashrate so i7 6700k could possibly get 400mh/s , maybe a bit more , or maybe a bit less,


[14-Nov-18 07:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> When you manage to get yours up and running on verus, you could be the first person to post your i7 6700k hash rate results for ccminerv3 over in the #cpu-hashrate ,


[14-Nov-18 07:46 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> @John Westbrook can you confirm this? This is terrible, man.


[14-Nov-18 09:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz_77> @Emmanuel I DM'd him on Twitter


[14-Nov-18 09:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz_77> @Emmanuel  This is horrible. John is such a good guy.


[14-Nov-18 09:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz_77> One of the above links, is a 2 minute clip from the local news, where John lives... Telling his story


[14-Nov-18 09:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> I see his twitter, yes, it's true


[14-Nov-18 09:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz_77> I mean, I don't know John too well. 
But he really does give off the feeling that he is a guy that likes life & likes crypto


[14-Nov-18 09:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> I know him, he's the best.


[14-Nov-18 09:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz_77> I've stumbled onto some of his old Steemit posts..
And the guy is just chill.. poems & crypto, and all of that

[14-Nov-18 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz_77> @Emmanuel Maybe Mike Tout can give us some direction, on how we should proceed, in the Discord.. So everyone can be aware of this.

[dscrdvrsc] <paydaSandros> Hi. Is it possible to stake VRSC in f.e. ginasismining pool without a need of installing wallets and such stuff. Can i just buy VRSC at exchange and send them from exchange wallet to pool wallet and receive back the revenue to exchange wallet?

[dscrdvrsc] <idrtis> Thank you for the new resistance to 51% attack document. Wouldnt it be a good idea to also include the notarization aspect?


[15-Nov-18 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Skillachie> These guys are doing voting but doing an ICO with resale https://www.agora.vote  . Verus should ensure they get covered in all the media outlets these guys get covered in


[15-Nov-18 04:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @idrtis in fact, the paper proves that Verus is immune to 51% hash attacks even without dPoW. We do mention that we are also notarized with dPoW, but it would take a very expensive, combined stake and work attack to get to the point where we'd even think about needing help from dPoW. The great thing is that if that ever happens, it's there üòÉ  defense in depth. Though we haven't written a proof for it, we may be the most secure public chain in crypto right now.


[15-Nov-18 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Skillachie we are not yet a voting solution, but it is our vision. Today, we believe we are one of, if not the most secure, privacy-centric cryptocurrency that brings together the best technology for fundamental use over time. Until we are a voting solution, which is definitely part of the vision, we would prefer to be compared to the best advanced cryptocurrencies, where we stack up pretty well. There will be a time for that, and we hope that by that time, there still won't be a reasonable comparison, just for a different reason üòÉ


[15-Nov-18 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mavenL> Do we have a timeline to start serious marketing campaign? Until now all we‚Äôre doing is just organic grow


[15-Nov-18 09:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @mavenL I think we need to create a successful, community driven, organic marketing campaign. the Foundation can support community efforts, but it is not setup as a company to drive a marketing campaign separate from the community


[15-Nov-18 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Just so you know. There is a lot going on, but we still have a lot of work to do to get to the mobile adoption and additional applications, which I believe will drive more adoption than people think right now. Until then, a community member offered and started working on a rebranding effort. In the not too distant future, we hope to have the community help decide on some makeover options. We're also getting help on marketing from community members going forward.
Right now. we just posted our latest news on r/Cryptocurrency, and again, we have downvoting trolls. This time downvoting a mathematical proof that solves the 51% hash attack problem. If you have ideas to improve the project with foundation resources beyond working to find great contributors and rewarding them for contributions, we would love to hear them.


[16-Nov-18 02:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <IP> @miketout hey Mike, something shady going on with mining. Nethash is very high while mining profitability is much lower than eth or rvn mining or whatever coin from whattomine. most of hash is on some private pools. my guess is it is either private mining software or botnets. either way worth taking a look

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @IP we are also looking at those numbers. If there is something, we will adjust accordingly.

[16-Nov-18 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Coingecko goes by STEX. We have lower liquidity there, as there was not a lot of awareness of trading at STEX. We need Cryptopia to come online, which I suspect would solve that as well as enable CMC. I hope it's soon.


[17-Nov-18 12:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> Hi guys, just landed on Discord but following Verus since the beginning üòâ  I would like to discuss a few questions: why I need a privacy coin if my cash-to-crypto (and the other way too) can and is easily tracked?  In the future Verus will allow a secure and privacy centric voting system but....how many average Joe will trust "a strange and nerd thing processed abroad, like China"? 51% isn't something you can explain to uneducated large public. 

Disclaimer: I'm not in the US, said China mainly due to their hashing power but my question is country-less  üòÅ


[17-Nov-18 12:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> And the last one: PBaaS is, imho, the best approach and can really bring blockchain in IT industry but...is there an use case? I'm the company X and use Verus autochain to deliver my project; which guarantee I have that the service will keep running? I mean: who gurantee my SLA and/or OLA? And what about KPIs?


[17-Nov-18 12:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> Also: will Verus be compliant with EU gdpr? If yes, what approach will be used to: keep Customers data within EU and to erase their data if/when requested/needed?


[17-Nov-18 05:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> A few of your questions can be answered with how blockchain technology itself works. Your information is never held by any one corporation and your private data need not ever be erased as it is truly and provably untraceable.


[17-Nov-18 05:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> The guarantee your service will continue to run is the same or better than any other corporation. You can see the hashrate providing power to the network


[17-Nov-18 05:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Not any one thing is being processed abroad, as every single thing is being processed everywhere, across the entire network, fragmented and encrypted, and so impossible to hack or steal any useful data from.


[17-Nov-18 06:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> @Godballz I have an enterprise point of view and like, really like, Verus because it's made by an industry expert (imho there isn't a c-level who will adopt a thing made by underground developers). "processed anywhere" means that an enterprise, in EU or abroad if handling EU datas, can not put any Customer data on it (kyc, ie); same goes with the data deletion, also against EU GDPR.  Mike's aaS approach, again imho, is the future of business blockchain and I would like to understand if and how Verus position in the market.


[17-Nov-18 09:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Sounds like you'd want to talk to the man himself, Mike. You bring up interesting questions though and now I'm curious myself. I mean yes technically the data leaves the country but only in an illegible, indecipherable form. I'm sure all this has to be addressed but just me to you- how is that in any way not better than storing something in one semi-secure location with no or minimal encryption in your on home country?


[17-Nov-18 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I hope blockchain technology and particularly veruscoin is given the opportunity to prove itself if precedents have not yet been set


[17-Nov-18 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> I'm still looking for a place where a business approach to blockchain can be discussed...and I'm sure here is the right place üòÉ  GDPR is just an example of the many, many business issues that all (imho, of course) blockchain solutions/approaches do not address. 

Take all the uber super coins born to solve counterfeit issue...since Verus is a latin word, let me explain my point of view in latin: Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?¬†
They are facing a 2000 years problem: you have an immutable and ethernal proof of....something manually entered by a human. At the end, you still need to trust a third party.


[17-Nov-18 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @Diabolik one of the very exciting things about Verus is the ability for a project or company to stand up a custom blockchain that serves their purposes very specifically.  With the inclusion of Crypto Conditions, a company can have a very targeted config at the blockchain level, specifically serving their own niche purposes.  The Stake Guard CC, for example, is the first to be activated on Verus, but any org or company could, through PBaaS, stand up their own blockchain and code their own CC that is, essentially, ‚Äúapplication specific‚Äù and the community is rewarded as providers of the blockchain services.  I‚Äôm speaking in very general terms btw. 

I‚Äôd also like to hear @miketout‚Äôs thoughts on the concerns a corp may have surrounding data security, control, trust, etc.


[17-Nov-18 10:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> @John Westbrook this is exactly the reason why I really like Verus and I think it can be a game changer...but: a Company X spin a custom chain to deliver a service to their Customers; how it can guarantee the service availability? who is accountable in case of issues/data breaches/downtimes? which is the cost model? roi? tco? 

I'm sorry, a lot of questionsüôÑ


[17-Nov-18 10:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Explain ‚Äúdata breach‚Äù? The way in which decentralized networks operate removes the dependency of uptime on a single point or even cluster of servers controlled by a single party.  Of course if the company is operating a private chain within a closed network that‚Äôs a different story.


[17-Nov-18 10:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> The other point to consider is that this model is not always the right model for every businesses needs.


[17-Nov-18 10:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <idrtis> This is an open protocol, I think it is always company's responsibility. They should decide whether using vrsc is better than alternatives or not and act according to the risk and rewards. Protocol and developers should not be responsible similar to  how tcpip devs are not responsible when someone gets hacked


[17-Nov-18 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <idrtis> "the data deletion, also against EU GDPR" . This is a massive issue for all blockchains as well. I dont think its anywhere near solved  in any blockchain.


[17-Nov-18 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> "data  breach" ? stolen coins are a data breach; a  bug in the code can result in a data breach etc etc. 

 @idrtis that's an interesting PoV but tcpip has no financial values, why blockchain as a protocol should have? If you provide a service you are accountable for it and you are also paid for it. Take as example the sim swap attack in the US: if you provide me a service, it's your responsibility protect my data or...you'll be sued.


[17-Nov-18 10:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <idrtis> I would agree with you if this was zcash or any other coin with dev fee in it, then they would be responsible. Mike and the team dont get paid if they improve the code, patch bugs, add new features. It doesnt matter whether they have any investment in it, maybe they have maybe they dont. It might be better if we can answer these questions in a bigger environment, BTC. What would you say if it were BTC?


[17-Nov-18 10:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> BTC? From a business point of view, completely useless. It was and still is a wonderful revolution/idea but can not be used in any business environment. Verus's aaS, same approach as Google cloud/Azure/etcc... is, imho, the only way to generate revenues and to create a "product".


[17-Nov-18 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Diabolik @John Westbrook @idrtis these are good questions, and i think there are good answers. i may not understand all the discussion yet, but here is my distilled take as a starting point:
1. John explained the use of PBaaS correctly, as well as custom CCs.
2. If someone creates a chain, the consensus models will provide some options, for example, privately (corporate keys) validated, PoS validated (likely 100% with Verus chain used as clock oracle, as per the Proof of Power reference in description of PoS), publicly validated by some other algorithm.
3. At least most chains would support z-transactions, certainly the first we expect to support in PBaaS
4. Every PBaaS chain is actually an independent block chain that can be deleted as part of an application use lifecycle. Of course, once public, no one can prevent the data from being retained somewhere, but if all critical data that should be deleted is encrypted, either explicitly, or as memos in a z-transaction, that should provide necessary foundation for best practice data security and privacy as well


[17-Nov-18 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <idrtis> It could be less useful in your point of view, but what I am asking is if an open source blockchain protocol such as BTC is used for business and there is a problem with either GDPR or data deletion right to be forgetton, how would you solve these questions?


[17-Nov-18 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <idrtis> @miketout,  I think @Diabolik is probably a lawyer and mostly asking for potential problems when PBaaS is used by corporations


[17-Nov-18 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <idrtis> If I understood correctly


[17-Nov-18 10:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> @idrtis nope! I work in IT Operation in a large multinational enterprise.

[17-Nov-18 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Quick side note, when data is created...to act responsibly...you‚Äôve got to assume it will live forever.


[17-Nov-18 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> I realize we are also discussing legalities of deleting data, but just saying üòÉ


[17-Nov-18 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> as far as who is responsible. there are plenty of disclaimers to help people understand, this is an open source project with a community of ostensibly, the world. we are people of many different disciplines building software and protocols that people can evaluate and use, either in the public, experimental system that is Verus Coin and running as a public service, whether we are here or not, or a corporation could even make their own implementation and use the open source, though it won't be the same system at that point and will no longer have the world as its community


[17-Nov-18 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> in this sense, it is exactly like BTC


[17-Nov-18 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we are not responsible for a company's use of the software or network


[17-Nov-18 11:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> just want to be clear on that, in case it was a little vague üòÉ


[17-Nov-18 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i'm kind of joking because it shouldn't be vague in the legal licensing, disclaimers, etc.


[17-Nov-18 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> if you use the BTC network for something and have a problem, who is responsible?


[17-Nov-18 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> @miketout I see a succesful blockchain as  a Redhat, opensource core and enterprise support plus useful (and paid) features. Am I wrong? Isn't it a way to generate revenues?


[17-Nov-18 11:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the difference is that someone needs to run infrastructure with the Redhat model. decentralization is the real advance. we write software, and it lives in the people


[17-Nov-18 11:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Public blockchains as a service don't require a company to keep them running properly if the protocol works


[17-Nov-18 11:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> they don't require a company to provision them


[17-Nov-18 11:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> run them


[17-Nov-18 11:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> do anything at all


[17-Nov-18 11:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> if the protocol is correct, the system lives as long as it is useful, independent of developers


[17-Nov-18 11:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <idrtis> There could an open source VRSC protocol, and a separate for-profit company that could help companies create software on top of vrsc


[17-Nov-18 11:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> or many


[17-Nov-18 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> this is the open source protocol, and people are making it live


[17-Nov-18 11:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> as we enable PBaaS, that creates a whole new capability that will be part of a public, auditable, open source protocol that lives in Verus Coin. companies can build on that with custom PBaaS chains and applications to their hearts' content. They don't have to worry about the same security issues as BTC, because we have advanced consensus protocols and will secure independent chains as appropriate for the application with notarization back into Verus->Komodo->BTC


[17-Nov-18 11:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> of course, some companies or governments may want their own implementations, so that is their option, but the public availability of the system to everyone is important to the vision


[17-Nov-18 11:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> you wrote "if you use the BTC network for something and have a problem, who is responsible?" a potential answer can be: which corporate uses btc? Keep in mind that I really love your approach and the fact that Verus is light years above some coins. I'm just looking for a constructive discussion on enterprise adoption


[17-Nov-18 11:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i agree that for enterprise adoption, the corporate model, whether it really works or not, is to have someone to sue, so they can feel there is "stake" behind all their bets. the way I see it, we should work to make it so that they can be responsible for their PBaaS code bases for example, and when they create a PBaaS chain of a certain class, mining, staking, and node providers for that service, which could also be limited to specific entities, would still use the Verus Network for that provisioning marketplace and protocols


[17-Nov-18 11:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> also enabling cross-PBaaS chain integration over time


[17-Nov-18 11:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it is actually not the primary scenario, but i can see that ability being valuable for general use of Verus


[17-Nov-18 11:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> Thank you, constructive discussion. Would be nice to see Verus mainstreamüòâ  I think, but may be completly wrong , that a business approach (use cases, services on top of open source core, maintenance plans, sla agreements, etc) is the only viable way to a mainstream adoption


[17-Nov-18 11:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I certainly think those things can eventually be provided by companies using the protocol and the public network


[17-Nov-18 11:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i also appreciate these kinds of deeper discussions üòÉ


[17-Nov-18 11:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> I'm  not sure I can help Verus right now, but let me know (who needs the good old ppt deck? üòÇ üòÇ )


[17-Nov-18 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> For others interested in business blockchain, have a look @ Gartner analysis (some are public available). They are often the "shill masters" üò¨  but concepts are valid and interesting


[17-Nov-18 10:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Diabolik appreciate it. i've worked a lot with Gartner and some of their analysts in my past roles. I do try to keep up on what people are thinking/measuring. welcome to the community, and I look forward to more discussion

[dscrdvrsc] <Bo> Hi, how much are the staking rewards for VRSC? I searched, but didn't find the answer


[18-Nov-18 09:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> @Bo just as mining reward 24 VRSC


[18-Nov-18 09:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Bo> per..


[18-Nov-18 09:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> Per won block


[18-Nov-18 09:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Bo> Okay, so you win blocks by staking? Or should I mine too?


[18-Nov-18 09:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> Mining is best done in a pool, depends on what hw you have available, you can try and check it out. For staking you need to buy VRSC, maybe 8500 to 12000 to win one block a day. Check out the Verus POS calculator XLS

[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @jbates58 I think it just takes so super long that it's not something we'd want to see done daily, we'd never get to use the explorer üòÉ ... well not that bad I guess, but I think the reindex was started around 2 AM EST and it's getting close to finished...so roughly 7 or 8 hours looks like at this point?


[19-Nov-18 05:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Maybe it could be done every couple weeks and a red bar across the top to indicate it's reindexing, with a little explainer faq


[19-Nov-18 05:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @John Westbrook that every 2 odd weeks would be sick. especially with a status bar üòÉ


[19-Nov-18 05:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> I'm going to look at the source code, pretty sure I can get the status bar coded in and maybe in a way that doesn't need to be "ticked" on or off by englal, if it can auto detect the status of the page

[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @DÕûÕ•UÕûÕ¶DÕûÕ≠EÕûÕ£ Why would you not use pbaas? It has so much better value than permissioned blockchains while - if we have wide recognition of the latest paper - providing more security at lower cost. The question is why would you use other solution than VRSC for developing?

[19-Nov-18 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Hi @dude, The reason I think someone who cares about building an application might choose to use PBaaS is the same reason we chose to make a new blockchain to solve key challenges in crypto. We wanted an independent chain with its own rules and capabilities that simply didn't exist. We wanted to leverage what we felt was the most secure option at the time, Komodo with dPoW and to enhance security and capability over the base starting point. We wanted a way to provision PBaaS chains for the applications described in the vision paper, and no decentralized solutions existed.
We have already developed some of the most secure new blockchain protocols and foundation in use today for public, truly decentralized P2P systems. In the process, we have leveraged and appropriately enhanced Komodo's crypto-condition technology that is behind Stake Guard, paving the way for what we need to develop PBaaS crypto conditions. There's still work to do to get to PBaaS chains, but when we do, we expect Verus applications to have their own blockchain "classes" with their own rules and crypto-conditions that serve and scale the application. There's not a great limit to what kinds of applications can be built that way, but it's a very different model to one chain, one set of rules, all applications share a VM.

[19-Nov-18 10:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> @DÕûÕ•UÕûÕ¶DÕûÕ≠EÕûÕ£ Blockchain as a service is, always imho!, a viable way to use a blockchain tech in a business environment....and Verus is trying to pave this way. Today, companies are investing billions in moving their physical servers to a cloud env and for a good reason: computing as a service means a shift from capex to opex, or, simpler, a pay-as-you-go model. If I make cars, my core business are cars and IT is only a supporting infrastrcture or "a cost".

Most, if not all, of IT companies are studying blockchain (as a protocol); ie we have our r&d producing internal reports in the last two years; today there isn't a public crypto that can be used for any business (discussion welcome here) and that's why I am trying to figure out if and how Verus fits.


[19-Nov-18 10:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> There are thousands of aspects that almost nobody consider in cryptospace, and the price is the most trivial one: would you accept to pay 10$/m the service X and the next month 50$? Or, which is the price to create a Verus subchain?

[dscrdvrsc] <dude> you dont need iota to use the iota protocol because transactions are free. you can send 1i to an address and will receive 1i. there is no mining so no fees. You can also send 0i and attach a message


[19-Nov-18 11:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> one way to use the iota protocol is by using MAM (Masked Authentificated Messages) where you can build up a Tree (Data Structure) so there you have your own kind of blockchain with sidetrees. every message can be encrypted with a key. if you like to read the message you need the address and the key to decode it

[dscrdvrsc] <dude> so you only need the tokens to transfer "value" like data from one machine to another. (e.g. one car is selling its data like geo position to a service that will give you best direction from A to B, or a weather station is selling its data to a weather forecast service) that can be just piece of data or a stream.

[dscrdvrsc] <dude> there is also a implementation of what bitcoin dudes would call "lightning network" but its called "flash channels" in iota (btw its still working and open sourced for over ~ 12 month. so you make instant transactions between peers from one "master address" to another, which is working by using WebRTC

[dscrdvrsc] <evilwar> @John Westbrook An idea regarding syncing the explorer. Why not have the explorer sync once a day, and while its syncing use the last synced cache version of the block chain for the explorer. That way it is synced daily, and users still have access to it. Just display a warning at the top informing the last sync cycle. That should increase usability.

[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> The Verus dApp developers will have to stake to publish their mainnet smart contracts, right? Once you guys have the smart contracts functionality out.


[20-Nov-18 10:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> And each smart contract creates a new blockchain with its own currency by default?


[20-Nov-18 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> Good afternoon, Is Verus an Independent asset chain on komodo (runtime fork) or a full fork of komodo?


[20-Nov-18 01:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Good idea @evilwar I'm not sure yet if that's possible with the current code as I'm not super familiar with the base code and how it works with the db...but i'm sure it's possible at some level üòÉ

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> If sapling can eventually enable private z-transactions over mobile does that mean that truly private messaging and communication may be a thing? Like a mobile text messenger service that can't be snooped in on.


[21-Nov-18 05:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> @Godballz I think so. The message/text part of z-z should be just as safe from being decrypted as the rest of the transaction info.


[21-Nov-18 05:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> I sent some wallet key info to the team once, and I was told to use the message field in a z to z transaction to do so since that was the safest way to share sensitive info.


[21-Nov-18 05:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> A z-to-z private messaging system would be huge if it could eventually be made as simple as texting

[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> for those interested in the EU market (and Verus shouldüòÅ ) this is an interesting, official article: https://www.eublockchainforum.eu/reports "blockchain and gdpr". Verus already has zero knowledge and enforcing all personal data on z-addr should allow polls inside the EU or outside with EU customers. Do not understimate gdpr as it is being enforced much like US SEC is doing with securities

[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> According to this recent article, it costs $6,000-$30,000 for VerusCoin to be listed on a small exchange, perhaps the community could donate that relatively small amount? A second exchange would get VerusCoin listed on CMC. https://www.bitcoinmarketjournal.com/crypto-exchange/

[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @tothemoon sorry to hear of your loss.  It's true, as @zpajk said, in crypto you are "your own bank."  There's really nothing anyone can do in situations like this, cryptocurrency is decentralized, so there is no "excluding" or blacklisting of wallets, etc, there is no central party in charge.  The best you can do is learn from the experience, identify how you were hacked, and take measures to be more secure in the future.

[25-Nov-18 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> A few quick tips:

1 - Never save your passwords.  Come up with a formula for passwords and create a different password for EVERY site you use.
2 - For all crypto logins (exchanges for example) use an encrypted email address you never use in any public forum with association to your name.  So there's no way to associate you with the email address (except by exchanges themselves)
3 - Use a complex and long password for your computer

Personally I would not use Agama from a computer that has any potential security leaks (i.e. is used on public wifi's without vpn, is left unattended without locking/securing, work computer, etc)...and avoiding Windows can up your security experience.  If you want to up the security even further, buy a cheap laptop for dedicated use with Agama and similar wallets and never use it for anything else.  

Anyway, again, sorry to hear of your situation and hope you can move on without feeling too down about it.

[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> Any password, even a 256 characters, is useless if your computer has been infected; once someone has access to your keyboard, your're fried. Often same apply to 2fa, there are malwares ables to change the addresses you are copying with ctrl-c ctrl-v. Imho, as John said, a dedicated pc/vps is the greatest/simplest security layer an user can add.

[dscrdvrsc] <AndrewK> wow KMD is pushing a lot of the Verus innovations. At this point, with Verus Hash, 50/50 POS/POW, etc. bieng pushed to KMD, what is going to be a major differentiator of Verus from KMD?

[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> VRSC mining isnt changed


[27-Nov-18 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> neither is KMD mining


[27-Nov-18 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> new options available for assetchains, being the creator of the verushash, this only helps VRSC


[27-Nov-18 09:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Will there be a mandatory upgrade prior to 12/15?


[27-Nov-18 09:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> This means new Komodo Asset Chains can choose VerusHash, instead of the past, where the only option was Equihash


[27-Nov-18 09:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> it doesnt affect VRSC


[27-Nov-18 09:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> and existing asset chains may switch to VerusHash, like BTCH is planning to do.


[27-Nov-18 09:21 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I think it does affect VRSC - in the sense that they can now truly be seen as innovators, contributors and collaborators.    

VRSC still has lots of utility over a KMD chain in many ways.    They have detailed proof of power and stake guard still as unique.  

Saying these advancements and sharing them in the ecosystem make less of a case for Verus Over KMD is like saying Eth advancements are not effective for erc20 projects which we all know is far from the truth.   

Verus continues to innovate and their advancements now have a wider adoption platform and foundation.    

If the loss of value of a coin was directly correlated on its open source nature, then BTC should be worth zero right?


[27-Nov-18 09:22 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Pirate is so very grateful for the hard work put into this by Mike and the Verus team.   We‚Äôre working on ways to show that appreciation.   

Thanks again everyone here at Verus!


[27-Nov-18 09:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> yes, of course you are right. what I mean was that the KMD release doesnt affect VRSC

I understand you meant that and also not in a negative way @jl777c 

I just wanted to point out to those who just skim and scan , that the intangible effect of all this, is far greater than people seem to think.    This type of ecosystem growth and sharing catapults future projects and their development efforts.    New projects can come in to innovate and integrate their ideas with ease as opposed to setting up months of basis and groundwork.  

This is a fantastic compliment to Moore‚Äôs Law, but for developers and brings the possibility of the two growing exponentially in a more concurrent fashion.   (Anecdotal of course).

[dscrdvrsc] <firesofmay> Started digging the white paper today. @John Westbrook (Hi John!) told me about Verus yesterday. Been looking at it since then.

About me: I am a software developer by profession. Did lot of QA/Coding at a startup called Helpshift. I am currently living in India.

Since last year, I've bee involved with various crypto startups, helping them with their community building/management. I've worked with Cofound.it, Musiconomi, Kleros in the past. Currently working with Maecenas and Etherisc as their Community Lead.

Cheers!

[30-Nov-18 10:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> part of coin launch maybe?


[30-Nov-18 10:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> their launch promotion includes something like 5% VRSC for trading volume up to a limit. I wonder of some trades are external bots using the API and trading the cost of a trade fee, which is fairly low, for the trading bounty


[30-Nov-18 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it's hard to know what to make of the trading, but i'm also not an expert. what it seems is that there is automated trading between bid and ask that would likely qualify for the trade bounty, and then I see what look like normal buys and sells that don't move much. It seems the trade bounty could explain what look like bots earning the bounty. if so, then I would guess once the trade bounty is exhausted, it should settle down to something that looks more normal

[dscrdvrsc] <dude> so what should I think about this now?


[03-Dec-18 11:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I am regularly looking on AACoin exchange, and though they definitely do have fake volume, we keep being told this is normal in China and have seen nothing else negative. They have been good to work with on the tech side as well. To make sure I have a little at risk there, since it was announced, I keep a small amount of VRSC and a small amount of BTC there. Every once in a while, I have seen a low ask and bought a little, or a very high bid and sold a little. I am not getting filled in the off-book, in-between trades that seem to be by bots. That has been my experience, but I can't say more either positive or negative.

[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Umm...so, just read Mike Sr.'s announcement. In pretty much every description on Verus by the team/supporters, inevitably listed as a top feature after triple secure and sapling is asic/industrial miner resitant...it's not even eoy yet, and someone's already developed one. I'm  a huge supporter of the project, so this concerns me and I'm raising questions accordingly. Tbh, the team's approach of the hardware manufacturer to broker some kind of deal struck me as...a little naive? What did they expect in response? That wd be like approaching Bitmain and asking them to slow down their miners cos Satoshi wd have disapproved. I don't mean to come off snarky, but pls take my tone as a reflection of how jarring this news was to me. I took the team at their word that this sort of development wd be near impossible, but more realistically - an exceedingly onerous undertaking that wd likely not be seen for a significant amount of time. If we're hard forking already, then it seems this is just the beginning of the same old story in crypto- the cat and mouse game that bigger projects like Monero have been playing for years now. If it's more accurate to just remove the "equality of cpu/gpu" and asic resistant selling and strong points, what does that mean for the future of Verus as such a strong community underpinned project supposedly built into its DNA? Thanks for responses to these concerns. I imagine I'm not the only one harboring these reservations .


[03-Dec-18 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> The thing is, as there are more and more developers and manifacturers coming out for FPGA's, you will be most likely forced to fork them off every month or so unless you build the algo around the machines like progpow.


[03-Dec-18 07:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ted> take it easy,these are all small things.


[03-Dec-18 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> I really like the progpow path, every unit is on equal ground etc


[03-Dec-18 07:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> @jintaa you're not alone.  good comments in my opinion.   What I see is a philosophical battle going on about how egalitarian mining will be achieved.  Basically the ProgPoW argument is that we can use an "extension" to other algorithms to assure mutual cost sharing.  Therefore, "ASICs" could still be made but they wouldn't be anymore profitable than mining with a CPU or GPU.  The other argument (and I'm sure there are others) is that the only way to truly achieve egalitarian mining is to default to the fact that we are human and rely on human influences even if that means tribal warfare (BCH ABC vs BCH SV).  Therefore,  the true measure of egalitarian mining relies on the AGILITY of algorithm developers to stay ahead of ASIC producers or some other source of centralized mining (network warfare).  

ProgPoW is definitely interesting but I'm not so sure how widespread adoption will go.  So far, I'm still stuck at a point believing that developer agility will remain the dominant influence on PoW mining.

Admittedly.. I still have a bazillion videos to watch to learn more about ProgPoW and how it's not an "algorithm" it's an "extension"... okay, but even that lends more to favoring developer agility lol


[03-Dec-18 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> @miketout the problem with the mining fpga is they have a rental plans for mining not only sales, my opinion it's not talk with them, you should do something to block them, it's no possible to mining with this rewards at this time. Thanks, good day.


[03-Dec-18 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> @grendel25 developer agility is a form of centralization too.


[03-Dec-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> how bout limit hashrate per ip address ? üòÑ


[03-Dec-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> people can buy entire ip ranges


[03-Dec-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> Your philosophy it's changing?? Because the team only want to mining with cpu, now gpu, and you want to talk?


[03-Dec-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> This things don't talk only acting like many others projects.


[03-Dec-18 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> even wth FPGA , if there is a hashrate limit/ ip address , it can only do so much hashrate per ip address ?


[03-Dec-18 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> That's no a solution, fork a change . That's all


[03-Dec-18 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> so if the hashrate limit is set to match CPU / GPU then


[03-Dec-18 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> Fork is a solution


[03-Dec-18 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> @Gordon Komodo , if you use a pool, nobody knows who is solving the charade, what is its ip,etc. , except for the pool operator.


[03-Dec-18 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> then pool will be abolished if the limiter is applied?


[03-Dec-18 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> All other things that you say are band aids. üòÇ


[03-Dec-18 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> fork sounds like a cat and mouse game , i think


[03-Dec-18 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> I'm disappointed


[03-Dec-18 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> why disappointed? math is math, reality is reality, it's not easy


[03-Dec-18 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> Because im from the begining in the project an the philosophy it's changing


[03-Dec-18 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @admon there is no way to make any algorithm that won't eventually get hardware. we say that in our vision paper. we have not had hardware until now, and we have two options, spend a lot of our best development energy on an unending arms race until ASICs eventually win if we have enough development resources left to do the most valuable thing we can, which is the vision, or figure out a way to smoothly transition to hardware with an open source option that is equally accessible to all and do our best to make CPUs and GPUs continue to be a viable option. We are most concerned about the long term success of the project, and the real purpose of the hash algorithm, 50/50 model is maximum decentralization. If we can achieve that AND have FPGA support, we are basically protected from an arms race until ASICs, which would require significant market cap to justify the investment.


[03-Dec-18 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> @Emmanuel  because if they use a more power before the project accomplish who will made validate, I know there are 50-50 but you will lose power in the net to fast in the next year's.


[03-Dec-18 08:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> I only remember that the project will be asic resistant, so what happend?


[03-Dec-18 08:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Well it is asic resistant as of now üòÖ


[03-Dec-18 08:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> I know that you have a hard work to do, maybe you are tired, let's time to think and evaluate it.


[03-Dec-18 08:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> Yes but not for fgpa


[03-Dec-18 08:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> our original goal was to use maximum CPU advantage to have a chance of resisting GPUs when they come. we did, and with @Chris - LOUD Mining Dev-Ops joining the community as an incredibly helpful GPU dev who also helped on the CPU side, I'd say we achieved it. at the same time, we did not have a hardware design, and now that we do, we see there are some things we may be able to modify to help equalize FPGA, CPU, and GPU as well. If we can get cooperation from FPGA providers, the most serious miners can invest and make professional returns while still making it reasonable to continue mining on CPUs and GPUs. Most importantly for the long term success is decentralization and continued progress towards the vision, which is what we are working on and would like to stay focused on vs. a hardware arms race. Please look at our vision paper and white paper, we always talked about a holistic approach to ASICs, that includes the hash algo being CPU optimized and 50% POS to prevent the security issues. People kept saying that meant ASIC resistant, but we never claimed it was truly resistant, and we always said in interviews there is no such thing as a truly resistant algo. There really isn't. Our goal now is more equalization.


[03-Dec-18 08:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we do not expect to make FPGA purely equal to CPU and GPU, but we know we can close the gap to some degree. We could also knock them out right now, but if we do, the next hardware will come along, and we will be in the same position with someone else. The hardware that would then be required will also cost a lot more.


[03-Dec-18 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> The goal is descentralization,


[03-Dec-18 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> There will be always better versions, so much resources wasted just to fork them off, ar best, make a algo change so they wont be that much better, so cpu/gpu/fpga, everyone can have something from the pie


[03-Dec-18 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> right, so if we fight hardware until only the most expensive hardware finally beats us, we will be most centralized by the very few who could afford it


[03-Dec-18 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> How do you propose closing the gap between the performance of one 2500 FPGA and that of a GPU/CPU?


[03-Dec-18 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Yii we will not waste a great deal of resources if we can fork to bring them closer. this is like Aikido or Chin Na, but if we try to stop them, we will fight until someone beats us


[03-Dec-18 08:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> 60GH+ crushes everything


[03-Dec-18 08:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Yeah cool, do the first thing


[03-Dec-18 08:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> Yo have a Titanic work.to do


[03-Dec-18 08:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> Sorry for my response but I'm üò°


[03-Dec-18 08:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @bishop i'm not going to disclose that yet, but it would be pretty trivial to knock them out, which i'd prefer not to do rather than close the gap. if we can enable them to serve the community with less expensive devices, especially if we can keep CPU and GPU relevant, that will be maximum decentralization, IMO


[03-Dec-18 08:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> Sure, it's trivial with a fork


[03-Dec-18 08:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @admon I don't think it's titanic, but we think a lasting solution is better than a war with many battles


[03-Dec-18 08:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> Just trying to figure how in the world you can close a 60GH gap when the best CPUs and GPUS are doing 1.6-1.8GH


[03-Dec-18 08:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @bishop i mean brick those machines for VerusHash without the option of bitstream upgrade


[03-Dec-18 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> you would basically need to see these FPGAs go to 10GH or less than what they are currently doing. Not sure how that is work out with them selling for 2500/unit


[03-Dec-18 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> not going to disclose my technical plan on that now, but if we do agree to work with FPGAs at this time, we will want to have a plan that makes sense to call for peace now. there is some work to still do, and we are working on that.


[03-Dec-18 08:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> Thise companies don't care talk and reduce hashrate


[03-Dec-18 08:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> no one is going to reduce their hashrate, it's naive to think that


[03-Dec-18 08:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> That's right


[03-Dec-18 08:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> they have a multipurpose unit selling for X dollars


[03-Dec-18 08:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> Is the sale engage


[03-Dec-18 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it's not a question of choice. there will be a fork. it's a question of if the fork will support FPGAs but with them being slower, or if it will block them and postpone for a bigger battle later


[03-Dec-18 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> Bitmain is a clear example.


[03-Dec-18 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> Well my opinion is that they don't care


[03-Dec-18 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> They sell many miners


[03-Dec-18 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> They accomplish his sales


[03-Dec-18 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> Next


[03-Dec-18 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> The math doesn't really work for them to run slower. I see that as a non-starter


[03-Dec-18 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> I'm not salty over this either, it's the nature of the beast for this to happen. As a miner from early June, it sucked having to turn things off last month


[03-Dec-18 08:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> You are assuming things @admon üòÖ. Not every chines company is like bitmain

[dscrdvrsc] <admon> Really????


[03-Dec-18 08:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it's not a question of math. it's not a question of their choice in slowing things down. if they choose not to follow the fork, we won't have FPGAs, so that won't be the end of the world either. it's question of whether we decide to fork to slow them and cooperate with them to help the community of serious miners or if we block them and commit to doing more work multiple times in the future


[03-Dec-18 08:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> Plus plus plus plus


[03-Dec-18 08:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Well yeah


[03-Dec-18 08:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Unfortunately, fpga on the Network allows them to scoop up coins for next to nothing while we have to deal with electricity cost and wear and tear on expensive parts. This allows them to dump at extremely low prices, manipulating the price and lowering the value of verus for us all


[03-Dec-18 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> And not only this they have rent plan of cloud mining


[03-Dec-18 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> no one should be CPU/GPU mining anymore with the hashrate where it is, unless they have free electric and even so, you are better off mining other things


[03-Dec-18 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> So in the meantime while we figure this out they are essentially lowering the value of all of our wallets..


[03-Dec-18 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763

[03-Dec-18 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> @miketout it is a question of math... no manufacturer is going to sell their multipurpose units for substantially less than the prevailing rate when one of the algos decides to slow down


[03-Dec-18 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i am, and I don't have free electricity, both on CPU and GPU. if someone wants to help the network, believes in what we're doing, or just keeps their computer on, they can make their choice.


[03-Dec-18 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> not sure of your point @bishop maybe i really don't understand what you're trying to say


[03-Dec-18 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> I'm supporting the network by staking but I refuse to be a loss leader

[03-Dec-18 08:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> @miketout they are selling at 2500 a unit and do 60-65GH (from what I have read), how do you see them (without getting too technical) working with Verus


[03-Dec-18 08:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> @Yii they have a rental plans


[03-Dec-18 08:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Its not a rental plan


[03-Dec-18 08:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I will continue to mine don't get me wrong, I believe that this project is still undervalued but fpga introduce a lopsided  element to a large part of the way this coin rewards


[03-Dec-18 08:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> I see in website


[03-Dec-18 08:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> @Yii A rationale person doesn't mine at a loss. They mine something better and then exchange


[03-Dec-18 08:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> Maybe they have only for some special users


[03-Dec-18 08:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> You purchase and can host it over there in the datacenter or get i shipped


[03-Dec-18 08:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> hosting isnt renting


[03-Dec-18 08:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> because if they don't, everyone who bought one will need to mine something else. if they do, we have a plan to get them to offer a less expensive version, and with an attenuating algo change, FPGAs will still be a more professional choice. They would also know that they don't get forked away from because they cooperate, and the community knows they can buy a machine and we will work with the manufacturer if we fork.


[03-Dec-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> and i would support a project with that mentality @miketout


[03-Dec-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> how do you offer a less expensive version of a multialgo product? They would be cannibalizing their own product line


[03-Dec-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> ASIC, fine, but something that can change due to a revised bitstream, I'm not seeing it


[03-Dec-18 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Actually for an fpga 2500 bucks is quite cheap üòÇ


[03-Dec-18 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> @bishop let's do more time to fix this


[03-Dec-18 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Try to buy a bcu or cvp


[03-Dec-18 08:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> @bishop you and me know the only way is blocking the miners.

[dscrdvrsc] <admon> üòÇ


[03-Dec-18 08:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> You do realize one of the selling points of Verus, was the CPU and GPU even playing field argument, right? Highly efficient CPUs in the beginning, then GPUs and CPUs within reach of each other. I see no scenario where a gap can be closed with FPGAs


[03-Dec-18 08:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> The things is, you may knock this company of with their bitstream, as more developer come online every day with their cards and bitstreams, you will have to fight on 10 fronts at some point


[03-Dec-18 08:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> fpgas are coming ranging from 500$- 10000$ in 2019 you will be able to able to buy a 500$ usb fpga that has the same BEP of an F1. Coin devs will have to make a decision fork to memory intensive algos that FPGAS cant currently mine or embrace the new tech and move on. Many Bitstream devs would work with coins to make sure all parties are happy.


[03-Dec-18 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> MBC is a perfect example of a coin embracing the tech

[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> Zen Protocol


[03-Dec-18 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> so if we rule out closing the gap, then a multialgo approach is the next option


[03-Dec-18 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Build the algo around the machine, not a machine around an algo üò¨


[03-Dec-18 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Yii is correct. they have a low priced FPGA option, and what we do by blocking them is just raise the price bar to the next company offering something less people can buy. if we can get them to offer lower priced, equivalent ROI options to the community, and especially get the CPU and GPU's to still be relevant, I think that is ideal. We would also have no more concern of hardware until we are really a reasonable target for full blown ASICs.


[03-Dec-18 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> I see no reasonable timeline to be able to convince a manufacturer to lower their prices, especially when their F1 is but a few months old last I checked


[03-Dec-18 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> @miketout sorry for this comments, you can will do that you can do, but for the moment it's no profitable mining verus, sorry.

[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> F1s are not the only manufacturer


[03-Dec-18 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Well, they wont lower the price tag, that would be something new üòÖ


[03-Dec-18 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> @Honey I get that, but that's the one that is publicly available


[03-Dec-18 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Well the other current fpgas suck balls right now


[03-Dec-18 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> ....lots are publicly availiable


[03-Dec-18 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> bitstreams publicly available for Verus?


[03-Dec-18 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @admon understood. i will continue to mine, as i have confidence over time, but i fully understand. As far as pricing, think of simply serving different market segments with different product SKUs, usually a good move for a company.


[03-Dec-18 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> You need the machine first, the bitstream wont get you far alone


[03-Dec-18 09:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> In the meantime wouldn't this to a degree effectively gimp the pow side in a decentralized sense at the very least?


[03-Dec-18 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> it's going to be months for things to be resolved on convincing a manufacturer


[03-Dec-18 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> A vast majority of p o w earned coin would be sent to China at a huge discount


[03-Dec-18 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> so continue to expect 20TH and up hashrate


[03-Dec-18 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @bishop i wish everyone would think that so if it's sooner more people will be happy


[03-Dec-18 09:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> The manufacturer isnt mining, there are people all over the world enjoying some verus. There, decentralization üëè


[03-Dec-18 09:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> yeah im not sure why your focused on china lol


[03-Dec-18 09:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Yii this is our understanding as well. i will go back to working on options. i just thought it would make sense to talk about this. i'll check back to see if i can answer more questions a bit later.


[03-Dec-18 09:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> My concern is the effect on price and growth of the project moving forward. Hopefully this is something insignificant and not catastrophic


[03-Dec-18 09:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> @miketout I would love to be surprised but I know the lead-time involved with hardware. They're not magically going to have something ready in a couple weeks


[03-Dec-18 09:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> It's fine that you are having the discussion with them but multiple months at best is a very reasonable timeframe, absent a fork


[03-Dec-18 09:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> The price declined fromm 9k to 4k before they went online, and is stable now, what do you think


[03-Dec-18 09:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Godballz I strongly believe this too will pass. we need to keep our eye on the goal of decentralization and realizing the vision. these algorithms are a way to get there, and there are many factors to consider as a project evolves. I guess that's what keeps life interesting üòÉ


[03-Dec-18 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I really like the algo too and the balance it provides between GPU and CPU. Hope that stays true at least. It is a cool and unique feature


[03-Dec-18 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @bishop honestly, i wish everyone would believe that üòÉ we will have nowhere to go but up in that case


[03-Dec-18 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> @Godballz GPUs and CPUs can continue to play in the same ball league... except it's little league and the majors are 30x larger


[03-Dec-18 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> üòâ


[03-Dec-18 09:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I know my fear is it having an effect on how the project was designed to work. I will continue to mine and stake I just fear that little guy miners like myself might find it makes more sense to mind something else, sell it to buy verus, and stake rather than mine- leaving the mining for the fpga and the staking for everybody else


[03-Dec-18 09:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I also want to be clear. we do not have an agreement yet that allows us to say this is solved. i think it would be better to strike some cooperation that can make the best mining accessible to as many as possible and keep CPUs and GPUs an option. if we can't find a way that we believe is good for the community, we will have to fork with an algo that bricks them. everyone should know, as we do, that that will also postpone and likely complicate any ultimate solution


[03-Dec-18 09:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Makes sense. Thank you for having the conversation openly I imagine there are many difficult decisions that need to be made. I feel bad even raising my concerns now but it is probably best we have this discussion sooner rather than later like you said Mike the next round could be worse


[03-Dec-18 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> if you or anyone else has concerns, you are almost certainly not the only one, so it's good to be able to talk about them


[03-Dec-18 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <plazma> so verus now have fpga


[03-Dec-18 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> what's the timeframe on community vote?


[03-Dec-18 09:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we will have a plan, and we will discuss with the community. we are a community coin with community resources. i will be willing to code what i believe is the correct, or a good solution for the community. hopefully the community will work to get consensus and we won't have a reason to need an official contentious vote. how about we wait until there are options with more info?


[03-Dec-18 09:20 PM] actionslacks#4072
There was a guy who I think was fpga mining litecoin back in 2014 or so and was selling shares, kind of like one of the original cloud miners in a sense. I would think that the technical aptitude necessary to fpga mine would be a barrier to entry for most but I have no idea. Just wanted to mention it.


[03-Dec-18 09:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> I'm having difficulty understanding why FPGA-folk would honor a "slow down" agreement.


[03-Dec-18 09:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> if we change the algo, they will need to run the modified algo. i am working on how to slow down what an FPGA can do with a VerusHash V2


[03-Dec-18 09:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> relative to CPUs and GPUs


[03-Dec-18 09:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> So then it's a fork.


[03-Dec-18 09:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Is memory the primary weakness to an fpga?


[03-Dec-18 09:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> Yes @Godballz


[03-Dec-18 09:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it is a major weakness and raises the cost of any similar type of equipment, but just until the device with memory takes over.


[03-Dec-18 09:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Oh okay so that might not be the best route Because the next round of fpga would create a higher entry barrier


[03-Dec-18 09:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> But take and gpu/cpu combo with an fpga accelerator and you‚Äôre back to square one anyway


[03-Dec-18 09:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> I'd like to see continued forks until 24 rewards are over, at least. Hoping more people have time to get involved and spread out staking shares. But it's a double edge sword, because FPGAs lower exchange prices, which mean people should be able to buy more. Worst case, we get some people with large volume that plays with the market prices later on.


[03-Dec-18 09:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> At some point fpga's will be sold like gpus - the floodgates are open - 2019 will be a harder time for gpus than 2018 i think


[03-Dec-18 09:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> Yup, there‚Äôs enough of a demand this time around to make them stay


[03-Dec-18 09:26 PM] actionslacks#4072
Ltcgear, that was the name. There‚Äôs some bct threads. A little history on fpga mining.


[03-Dec-18 09:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Rather much more shitcoins on the market than 2013


[03-Dec-18 09:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @zpajk i have to be careful talking about the future plans too much to get people too excited about the future vs. what we have, but if you could fully understand the alternative things those resources would be moving forward if not regularly forking, you would likely have a different opinion.


[03-Dec-18 09:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Might. I held Electroneum while they made a few mistakes and made themselves ASIC-dependent. It really screwed a lot of holders over. But I see FPGAs as being very useful for blockchain as a whole moving forward, if they become more common. But small projects that don't actually need the hashrate should try to avoid them if decentralization is intended. At this point in time. I don't doubt things will happen in 2019-2020 that could sway my opinion.


[03-Dec-18 10:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> Hard fork FPGAs asap and start thinking about algo change that could wipe them off the grid forever afterwards. No negotiation is possible, FPGAs with such a hashrate can't be part of the network that is community driven, as they destroy economical incentive to be a part of the community for all but their owners, so basically limits the possible growth of our community.


[03-Dec-18 10:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> I personally disagree, I myself am a GPU miner and have 3 - 6 card rigs which are currently mining nothing but dust as the power cost outweighs the income. I have purchased an F1 FPGA mainly because it is very similar to GPU's as it can mine many different algo's but much more efficiently. I dont think this is something that can be fought and more time will be spent on "forking" and less time will be spent on the actual project. If it aint broke dont fix it. It's like trying to fork away from newer GPU's or CPU's because the hashrate is much higher. Embrace change or you will be left behind and become another project that has no volume.


[03-Dec-18 10:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> FPGA isn't for the common person yet. You're talking about limiting great network hash to few. Point of limiting to CPU/GPU is that "everyone" has one or can get it, unlike FPGAs.


[03-Dec-18 10:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> It seems like you guys have covered, almost every angle. If you want to eliminate FPGAs, make them riskier to buy, in the first place. Miners think in terms of ROI, and if this can't be accounted for, for sure--then it might have a significant impact on the sales & ultimately their usage w/Verus...


[03-Dec-18 11:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @eNOz  But Verus was created with VerusHash, which put CPU & GPU hash levels on an even playing field


[03-Dec-18 11:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> That is a core idea of the project


[03-Dec-18 11:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> @Cruz  is that the "use case" though or only reason for mining it?


[03-Dec-18 11:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> Not being a dick just asking


[03-Dec-18 11:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> cause I only heard about this project VIA the F1 discord


[03-Dec-18 11:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @eNOz No, you're good


[03-Dec-18 11:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> without them I wouldnt be here


[03-Dec-18 11:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Can you explain what you mean, by use case?


[03-Dec-18 11:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Sorry, I'm not trying to be a dick, either


[03-Dec-18 11:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> what is the core use of the coin?


[03-Dec-18 11:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> other than another digital currency that can be mined


[03-Dec-18 11:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> because there are 1000's of those


[03-Dec-18 11:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> VerusCoin ultimately will be used, as an example, to secure voting through its secure block chain


[03-Dec-18 11:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Getting to that point, there are many other aspects of the project


[03-Dec-18 11:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> This isn't a run of the mill project


[03-Dec-18 11:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Look at the lead dev's experience and you'll understand that


[03-Dec-18 11:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> @ok88 good luck with that, the devs will have to dedicate s lot of time accomplishing that and the actual project wont move forward. As someone said: you can run, but you cant hide


[03-Dec-18 11:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I understand that miners play a role, in crypto, too..
I'm not anti-miner


[03-Dec-18 11:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Yii I'm sure that can be done. It'd be better to focus on a project with a weak dev team....just my advice


[03-Dec-18 11:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Dont get your sentence, who should focus on what?


[03-Dec-18 11:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> People with FPGA/People that make FPGA should focus on a weaker project .... I know designing these is for the reason to make more money


[03-Dec-18 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Everything is about money. Gpu miners want to make money, cpu miners, asic/fpga miners, software dev for mining applications. Everyone


[03-Dec-18 11:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> FPGA want more money though


[03-Dec-18 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> That doesnt make much sense


[03-Dec-18 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Which means more influence


[03-Dec-18 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I vote that the community is more important for the development of this coin than fgpa adoption


[03-Dec-18 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> A fpga miner is most likely a gpu/cpu miner as well


[03-Dec-18 11:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Let's fork the shit out of it


[03-Dec-18 11:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Yii But with more capability.. so it's not


[03-Dec-18 11:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> More capability?


[03-Dec-18 11:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @ok88 totally agree


[03-Dec-18 11:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Why not mine something like Digitex? lol


[03-Dec-18 11:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> I dont get you, nevermind


[03-Dec-18 11:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> FPGA ‚â† VerusCoin


[03-Dec-18 11:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Fpgas might not be able to do a 51% attack but they can drive the coin down and then do a pump and dump, if they control enough of it.


[03-Dec-18 11:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> It has a algorithm which can be cpu/gpu mined, there will always be someone which invents a miner which is better


[03-Dec-18 11:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <plazma> luckily its not asic


[03-Dec-18 11:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <plazma> how about randomJS research by monero


[03-Dec-18 11:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @miketout let's just folk it now before all the coin is in the hands of a few rich miners


[03-Dec-18 11:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <plazma> to remove fpga and asic


[03-Dec-18 11:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I can't see the benefit of working with these massive fgpa miners


[03-Dec-18 11:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> It's like trying to help get the coin locked up by asic  miners


[03-Dec-18 11:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Yeah, please fork it. Cant buy a gpu right now, please only cpu mineable or ill get angry on the huge gpu farms in china


[03-Dec-18 11:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I'm actually thinking about selling all my vrsc.


[03-Dec-18 11:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @Yii FPGAs owners have no voice on this as they are basically cheaters that we as the community are trying to get rid of the community in the first place. If the gates developer would at last have half a gut to admit its creation my opinion would differ. Secretely mining is an instakill for those bastards as this have no single point in common with the vision the devs or community have on this project. Do not dare to compare this to the GPU miner developements that we had here, that were openly tested, announced and perfected to its current state. You just dont dare. We should have a hard fork as soon as its ready and plan no dates, no schedules and give no hope to the likes of scum that act in the full opposition to what we have achieved here as the community. Just fork it whenever we are ready and start back from solo mining on wallets, no problem with that - active community members will adopt the change in no time.


[03-Dec-18 11:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Because as a few people get all the coin, it will be worthless and controlled by them and impossible for anyone else to mine.


[03-Dec-18 11:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @ok88 Amen


[03-Dec-18 11:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I'm going to try and learn those exchanges later on today


[03-Dec-18 11:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @ok88 either this happens soon or I'm finding myself a new project


[03-Dec-18 11:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Gloryman Stay for Emery!!


[03-Dec-18 11:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> lol


[03-Dec-18 11:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> It would be good if they made this coin cpu from wallet only.


[03-Dec-18 11:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> What is emery?


[03-Dec-18 11:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Unai Emery... your skipper.. Arsenal


[03-Dec-18 11:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Yeah as i said, good luck with that. As More developers will get into the game, they will work on algos simultaniously. It took 2 guys 2-3 weeks to develop it, what do you think can secret mining ops with huge amount of money do? luckily the people who mined verus have at least just one machine and got some verus. Than it will be just one operation and you dont know what hit you, but ok


[03-Dec-18 11:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Lol


[03-Dec-18 11:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Hahhaah


[03-Dec-18 11:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Yii They are better off finding a better project, for their money, with a weaker dev team


[03-Dec-18 11:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Sorry, I'm so used to wenger.


[03-Dec-18 11:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Why weaker dev team, they dont pick the coin because of the dev team


[03-Dec-18 11:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Gloryman I'm a Sevilla supporter... He was our man for 3 UEFA Cup titles


[03-Dec-18 11:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Yii They should. Because they will be wasting money with man hours creating new tech, then they'll get forked...and it'll happen again and again


[03-Dec-18 11:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> So does the dev team, it depends who has more money to spend


[03-Dec-18 11:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I have 4ghs rate and I made 1 coin since yesterday


[03-Dec-18 11:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> You mean waste


[03-Dec-18 11:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> You are being silly now ..


[03-Dec-18 11:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Yeah its a waste on both sides


[03-Dec-18 11:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> It's about evening out the playing field. ASIC and FPGA developers want money, it's a business. CPU/GPU developers main interest isn't mining. I think FPGAs can co-exist in a crippled state. As for now they're too efficient, and sees only to the need of the few instead of the many.

[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @zpajk Who says CPU/GPU developers aren't about mining?


[03-Dec-18 11:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> That's crazy


[03-Dec-18 11:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Yeah, just look at RTX, what a great mining card.


[03-Dec-18 11:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> ..


[03-Dec-18 11:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> The point was; CPU/GPU are for the many


[03-Dec-18 11:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> FPGA main interest is not crypto


[03-Dec-18 11:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Everyone can buy a fpga. Its just online available as of now, but havent been actually to a store to buy computer parts in ages


[03-Dec-18 11:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> It's expensive


[03-Dec-18 11:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Good points. Jumping in late, and more specifically- using a codename to represent Verus is straight scummy. It does seem to blatantly go against everything that has been worked so hard   for and ultimately the core values- Verus= veritas=truth- why mine in secret? Why not try to be a part of the community rather than dump coins on an unsuspecting market


[03-Dec-18 11:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @zpajk I'm not against them trying to make money, but why should we let them do it at the expense of ourselves. They made their money by secretly mining our shit. Now we make our money by folking  the suit out of it.


[03-Dec-18 11:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> So is the 2080 ti


[03-Dec-18 11:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <plazma> i got 1 GH/s help+100 MH/s my own and its still at 0.7 verus on pool


[03-Dec-18 11:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @zpajk It's expensive and hopefully Verus makes is obsolete, for mining this coin


[03-Dec-18 11:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> As @ok88  said, it was done in secret... F*ck that


[03-Dec-18 11:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Yeah, i bet the scream wouldnt be as much if they said. Hey, we have a fpga now and are mining your coin. Thats whitefires fault with his bullshit: "lets mine secret cause they will fork". Im standing alone int the fpga community with my thought that it would be easier to approach the dev team before starting to develop a bitstream


[03-Dec-18 11:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> That alone shows that it was ill intended


[03-Dec-18 11:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> I tell you, you have to fight on more fronts now. You fork, someone else will pick up the development. It will be an endless fork bullshit


[03-Dec-18 11:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Yii If you approached the devs, they would've said no


[03-Dec-18 11:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> And you wonder why they are doing it secretly than üòÇ


[03-Dec-18 11:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> CPU & GPU mining with VerusHash.... that's it ...
It's in the paper


[03-Dec-18 11:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> And you guys are going against what is laid out, in that paper... That's where it stands right now


[03-Dec-18 11:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Godballz Sup bro


[03-Dec-18 11:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Cruz hey man


[03-Dec-18 11:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Actually where does it say that specific sentence in the whitepaper?


[03-Dec-18 11:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Mike did say asics may be inevitable unfortunately but I don't think anyone expected them so soon. Perhaps I don't understand the reasoning fully in it just yet but I don't see the value of having fpga on the network right now


[03-Dec-18 11:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Its skews the hashrate in a very lopsided fashion presently


[03-Dec-18 11:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Did he say FPGA? lol


[03-Dec-18 11:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> True and for the record I personally feel it sort of sucks


[03-Dec-18 11:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> He did say that we might have to deal with this


[03-Dec-18 11:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'm trying to play The Devil's Advocate here and look at both sides because Mike was considering negotiating and for the reasoning that the next wave of fpga miners might be less easy to get under control


[03-Dec-18 11:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Right exactly. I had always assumed it would be a more gradual ramp up


[03-Dec-18 11:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> These FPGA's are damn expensive


[03-Dec-18 11:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Which would further hurt a decentralization by placing large hash power in the hands of the wealthy


[03-Dec-18 11:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Bigger scale mining is a money game.. it moves fast


[03-Dec-18 11:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> And unfortunately now it's not just bigger scale


[03-Dec-18 11:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Really? People buy a mining rig for that money. 1


[03-Dec-18 11:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> How much?


[03-Dec-18 11:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Thats a 4 card 1080 ti rig, maybe get a 1070 on top


[03-Dec-18 11:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> A mining rig has more potential resale value and other uses. Arguably fpga evens out that Gap where asic could be left behind and rendered useless


[03-Dec-18 11:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> We've got to fork then lol


[03-Dec-18 11:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Fpga has resell value, its not an asic, you can actually do something with it üòÖ


[03-Dec-18 11:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That's why I said they close the gap between


[03-Dec-18 11:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> But besides


[03-Dec-18 11:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I think fpgas are worse than asics


[03-Dec-18 11:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> @Yii  You get the fact that FPGAs aren't available for everyone? Both supply and price-wise. Even if FPGAs are good and well, as for now they're way more in favor of few people, taking advantage of others.


[03-Dec-18 11:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Hell I wish Mike and the team, could make my phone mine as much as gpu and cpu


[03-Dec-18 11:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> No FPGA


[03-Dec-18 11:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Asics means that the coin is huge and its easier to keep folking away form asics. Also, asics are a huge investment. Fpgas are like close to impossible to stop without regular folking and they damage smaller projects


[03-Dec-18 11:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Why not? Most miners have one rig, hobby miners with 1-2 cards mine on nicehash as it is convenient. Its not even a good rig and everyone can buy it, no country restriction


[03-Dec-18 11:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Can't there be a way to create a hardware signature for the fpga each individually and add them to a blacklist updated regularly on the wallet so it doesn't affect anything else? Something along those lines Maybe? Like Hardware signatures only found in regular PCS but I imagine Asic would circumvent this anyway as they are part of standard PCS correct?


[03-Dec-18 11:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> @Emmanuel  developer agility is better than doing nothing at all to work against centralization.  But centralization is a point of view so who ever is the loser in being decentralized will argue that everyone else is centralized.  In other words, if bitcoin forked tomorrow and was only CPU mineable all the ASIC miners would argue that bitcoin is now centralized to large CPU data centers.

At least with developer agility you would think their interests would represent the community and if that representation were untrue then there wouldn't be much of a community left.  For example, I've witnessed mixed feelings here about how the developer responded.  Of course, it all remains to be seen what will happen next.  My opinion is that it's the coin, use case, adoption, and such factors that actually matter.  Bitcoin is ASIC and successful as hell and there are sorts of examples of popular coins that are either CPU/GPU/ASIC/FPGA POS etc etc... even coins that are 100% premine and doing just fine.  It's bold success that matters.  Everything else is just squabbles of inferiority.


[03-Dec-18 11:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Bold success meaning, staying true to your values...


[04-Dec-18 12:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> The problem I see right now with such a large gap in hashrate is that it has become very unprofitable to mine so people will stop and it will be for the most part mined by fpga. They have lower electricity costs and receive large amounts of coins so they will be able to dump the price. Ideally there will be a balance Maybe we are the miners who left buy the cheap coins and create value to bring the price back up but I feel like that might be a long shot


[04-Dec-18 12:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> I posted the chart in trading. Please show where it damaged the coin value


[04-Dec-18 12:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> It has the potential to does it not?


[04-Dec-18 12:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> An egg could be ate by a fox.  Or, it could grow into a chicken.


[04-Dec-18 12:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I didn't say it had affected price negatively yet just friendly discourse


[04-Dec-18 12:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Would you rather we forget about it and stop discussing it?


[04-Dec-18 12:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> More than likely the fox will eat the egg


[04-Dec-18 12:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> sure but to say 'potential'  idk... I could get hit by a bus tomorrow.  I'm all for friendly discourse  üòÉ


[04-Dec-18 12:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I find no harm in at least raising the subject


[04-Dec-18 12:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Haha


[04-Dec-18 12:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> There are so many bad projects out there with good price action


[04-Dec-18 12:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I believe potential was the correct word for the usage


[04-Dec-18 12:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Why not FPGA one of them?


[04-Dec-18 12:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> It's less about correct word usage and more about logic


[04-Dec-18 12:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> I'm more into arguments of substance


[04-Dec-18 12:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> adding an FPGA doesn't make any coin more or less likely to fail


[04-Dec-18 12:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> It's more about people using a FPGA do not have any real ties to the project...do they?


[04-Dec-18 12:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Whatever we are supposed to be a community. I can see how something like this can be polarizing but I think it's important we at least discuss this and try to remember that we are all on the same side here


[04-Dec-18 12:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> You know what Raven won't fail?


[04-Dec-18 12:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> And you know why Raven will moon again?


[04-Dec-18 12:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @grendel25  BC it's on Binance


[04-Dec-18 12:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> Billionaire CEO of O-stock... that's why.  CEO rich guy is going to make fireworks.  His ego is on the line


[04-Dec-18 12:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> a few people controling the price of the coin is one of the biggest factors of failing, look at etherum classic. They had to fork it because the coins were in the hands of only a few people.


[04-Dec-18 12:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Yeah Patrick Byrne or whatever his name is..
That is Raven, this is Verus


[04-Dec-18 12:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I see the fact that someone with a massively disproportionate hashrate can then stake those coins and further consolidate the market. On the other hand, it makes me want one of these bad boys. I don't even know what a fgpa is but it sounds cool!


[04-Dec-18 12:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> Raven has FPGA, valid logic point.  see?


[04-Dec-18 12:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Raven has 6B supply


[04-Dec-18 12:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> and look at Raven's hashrate... moon üòÉ


[04-Dec-18 12:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Verus has 80m


[04-Dec-18 12:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> You're logic is completely off here


[04-Dec-18 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> My point was to FPGA, don't steer the logic bro üòÉ


[04-Dec-18 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> It does seem a bit ironic that people are so upset about someone mining a privacy coin in secret


[04-Dec-18 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> One coin is on Binance with billions of supply


[04-Dec-18 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Post> what does the hashrate have to do with the supply? rvn has a 5000 blockreward, verus has 24...so what?


[04-Dec-18 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Each project is unique...


[04-Dec-18 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Post> yeah, so we can¬¥t compare it


[04-Dec-18 12:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> FPGAs have no impact on price. It has impact on supply only. Prices could actually benefit in Short Run, as fixed costs increase. No worries about that ...


[04-Dec-18 12:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> Believe me, I do like that the developer is interested in taking control.  It's strength and really good


[04-Dec-18 12:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Not to mention it's fully pow and the proportion of fpga to the network I would imagine is smaller. Right now we have ~500mhs vs 64ghs


[04-Dec-18 12:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> The underlying fact here is that this project was laid out, with VerusHash particularly, in mind .. for CPU & GPU


[04-Dec-18 12:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Post> you also can¬¥t compare hashrates of two different algos with another


[04-Dec-18 12:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> People can do what they want but I'm taking off all my miners and selling my VRSC. I might get back involved in the project if mike forks the shit out of the FPGAs. Nice seeing you all and thanks for the journey, hopefully see you again sometime on another project.


[04-Dec-18 12:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> I also like that Monero forked.  I think Verus is being more proactive than Monero was as far as timeline goes.  Monero slept on it too long.  Let's see how fast Verus devs move


[04-Dec-18 12:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Gloryman Ahhh not necessary man


[04-Dec-18 12:16 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> @Post  You can compare proportionally


[04-Dec-18 12:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Did Raven have laid out in it's White Paper that it would run a specific algo, unique to Raven, for CPU & GPU mining?


[04-Dec-18 12:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> and by scenarios


[04-Dec-18 12:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Let me ask.. 
What benefit do FPGA's bring to a project?


[04-Dec-18 12:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Post> i think so yeah, but they also are more fpga friendly rather than asic friendly as more competition is involved

[04-Dec-18 12:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> what benefit did ASIC bring to BTC?  The argument has always been more hash = more network security.   You know what zero or minimal hash means?  Failure or glitchy crap no one wants.  Which would you rather have?


[04-Dec-18 12:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Shouldn't a project be able to do what it wishes?

[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> You guys are upset because your GPU's / CPU's arent getting the mining rewards they were. Dont fight change embrace it. This would happen regardless of FPGA's if the project takes off. Dont be short sighted. Also the price argument is ridiculous. Price has increased since I got involved, most the guys buying FPGA's are experienced GPU miners, GPU / CPU mining is dying, change with the times. Nothing can be done to stop it, maybe delay it but not stop it.

[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @eNOz Change with the times, seems to mean do what is more profitable, or better for few


[04-Dec-18 12:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> @eNOz  Yep, and you also know how awesome those rigs will be in 2021 for the next bull run.  But at some point Bitcoin won't cycle down as much and leaving the rigs on 24/7 will be no problem to cover bills


[04-Dec-18 12:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Maybe I'm wrong


[04-Dec-18 12:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> Nope just adapt to your surroundings @Cruz

[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> There's no single tech that's going to win.  BTC will cycle prices upwards and other techs will be more valuable


[04-Dec-18 12:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Like VerusCoin did, in the Verus Vision Paper lol

[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> Lol @Cruz why did you get into Crypto?


[04-Dec-18 12:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> and how long you been in it?


[04-Dec-18 12:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @eNOz Because I love Satoshi's BTC White Paper


[04-Dec-18 12:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> most are here for profit


[04-Dec-18 12:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> @Yii I disagree.  There will be some other GPU exclusive hot coin and people will hoard GPUs again.  But my point is that eventually bitcoin will hold prices over say... $10K consistently and then that exchange rate will mean more consistent mining profits for anyone rather they mine FPGA/GPU/CPU/ASIC coins or whatever.  this is the blockchain revolution

[04-Dec-18 12:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I respect the financial side of crypto


[04-Dec-18 12:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> Sure, the sad thing is the "popular" ones are only there because they are profitable


[04-Dec-18 12:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> Look at ETH


[04-Dec-18 12:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> was major with all the ICO's


[04-Dec-18 12:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> then they start cashing out cause ETH cant pay rent


[04-Dec-18 12:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Nah, as more bitstreams will get developed, gpus will become more obsolet. What new algo? No problem ill make a bitstream üòÖ

[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Can you FPGA with ETP?


[04-Dec-18 12:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> But ICOs are good... get a bad name just like mt gox made a lot of people absolutely hate BTC in 2014

[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Later, @grendel25  . You started out on my side, but over the course of the night, I watched you drift to the dark side üòÑ


[04-Dec-18 12:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Anyways, my initial point when I started the discussion was Verus was built and introduced to the world as being resistant to these types of industrial mining hardware. It's what drew a lot of ppl to the project and at least what a lot of ppl, myself included, found to be extremely attractive about it. At the very least, the fact that we're moving away from that ethos is worth taking serious note of. Whether you take the capitalistic "no investment is bad investment" or more idealistic "this project is by the community,  for the community" approach. And I don't see how some in here can be so glib about the possibility that industrial miners such as fpga's cld actually threaten Verus' very meaning as a project. If you think the widespread use, recognizing and adoption of Verus is an inevitability written into the laws of the universe, you need to think again. This sort of development cld pose a mortal threat to a nascent, inchoate project such as this one. Choked into oblivion before it ever had a real shot by the avarice and nonchalance of the powerful few. Keep in mind- an inordinate advantage on the mining side ALSO leads to an inordinate advantage on the staking side. It's a vicious cycle that this project wd do well be remain vigilant for.


[04-Dec-18 12:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Wow. I don't want to be glib, but let's look at it another way.


[04-Dec-18 12:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Ok.


[04-Dec-18 12:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Verus Coin's vision and white papers say that it provides a holistic solution to ASICs, not that it is an ASIC resistant coin. That isn't the key point. We have FPGAs, but is anyone worried about a 51% attack right now?


[04-Dec-18 12:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> That just happened to Vertcoin with the market drop. We have talked about hardware being inevitable. I have said it every time I'm asked, but the question is how do we transition.


[04-Dec-18 12:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> üëÜ


[04-Dec-18 01:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> My only concern is that not all coins are dealing with this just yet so is right now the time for transitioning? No idea and this seems like a very difficult subject but does this leave us exposed so early on to pump and dumps or centralization?


[04-Dec-18 01:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> We won't get pummeled into oblivion, and we intend to slow FPGAs to reduce their advantage, but if we full on stop them now, we just ratchet the inevitable stakes higher. If instead, we can get an agreement from the FPGA provider that they make the FPGA code open, that the FPGA company will commit to their customers to follow the algorithm change without delaying us, and that the community can get into units with the same economics at a lower price point, this may be a good transition to focusing on what the vision paper is really about, which is PBaaS and the applications that use it. That will be much more of a positive for the future of Verus Coin than repeated forking, IMO. We are asking for a lot, and the foundation is also offering them a large, time locked bounty for their cooperation if they go along with these terms, which are only in the interest of the community. If we can't get an agreement, then I might think it better to take the nuclear option, but if they cooperate with us, it will be a major step in crypto and better for people in the community now than many are expressing or believe IMO.


[04-Dec-18 01:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> but they used the nuclear option on us by mining in secret


[04-Dec-18 01:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> It is reassuring that you are level-headedly weighing the options and appear to have a plan to say the very least. Let us hope they are at least reasonable and that this all works out for the best


[04-Dec-18 01:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Gloryman that is kind of a grimy tactic but on the other hand if I were them I wouldn't expect to be welcomed with open arms


[04-Dec-18 01:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> It's not personal. They want to make a huge profit at our expense. That's the name of the game. So, we either let them do it, cooperate to let them do it or stop them.


[04-Dec-18 01:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Gloryman they are supporting a lot of coins. Someone implemented our algorithm, and they started selling it. I suspect that however they got introduced to Verus Coin, they were told we'd fork to stop them if we found out. It was certainly our first thought, but because we can, we considered the fact that if they would prefer to cooperate and do better in the process, it could be an opportunity for us to transition. What if we ratchet it up, end up not being able to fork the next ones away, and they prefer to stay uncooperative?


[04-Dec-18 01:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Then the next uncooperative ones would take over and there is nothing that can be done about it


[04-Dec-18 01:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> unless we have open FPGAs


[04-Dec-18 01:10 AM] actionslacks#4072
Does anyone have any links about this clandestine fpga mining ? This is an interesting development that seems like it could have some real ramifications


[04-Dec-18 01:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> maybe we could just go back to cpu mining from wallets and cut out all the pools and gpus


[04-Dec-18 01:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> @miketout I understand you, and see where you're coming from, honestly I do. It just seems that there may be some underestimation of the human capacity for greed here. I dont see the manufacturer giving you any option other than the nuclear one. The parable of the scorpion and the fox/toad comes to mind. And EVEN if we were able to strike a deal with THIS manufacturer....it's just ONE!!! manufacturer....what stops the next one and the next one, esp as Verus grows from strength to strength as intended? I understand my arguments actually raise even MORE problems, as the seeming only option it leaves is go nuclear and prepare for an endless arms race that will ultimately cripple the project anyway, but I feel it's worthwhile to raise these questions now, if they address the exploratio of avenurs that lead nowhere anyway...


[04-Dec-18 01:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @jintaa I agree, you cant negotiate with terrorists.


[04-Dec-18 01:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Post> lol, terrorists üòÑ


[04-Dec-18 01:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> We are not a toad :)
by addressing the issue now, we have a chance to put it to rest at a low and accessible price point, especially if by not ratcheting up, we make mining accessible to many more people going forward. more casual mining with CPUs and GPUs for those with cheap/free electricity, and professional mining, still decentralized with FPGAs, that will have versions with similar economics for less than the current ones if we get agreement. not just from one company, as the algorithm will be open, which is an important part of agreeing, but they developed it or paid to develop it, so being first to market is just where they are. if they cooperate and have a good product that they make more accessible to the community, they will have done something to redeem themselves. they did promise to us that only their customers were mining, not them, so there is still some argument that they didn't centralize Verus.


[04-Dec-18 01:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> What would stop all of them is the fact that it is our algorithm, and it would be open


[04-Dec-18 01:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Its a trick @miketout . That's what they want you to believe. So, you wont do anything.


[04-Dec-18 01:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I can assume it is optimized in hardware with their design. they do seem to be competent. they didn't come to us. i went to them after hearing about it.


[04-Dec-18 01:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @miketout Why not go back to cpu mining only. It would encourage more users, as everyone could mine.


[04-Dec-18 01:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> what is the trick? i'm not closed minded, but I don't see one.


[04-Dec-18 01:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> They said they aren't mining it


[04-Dec-18 01:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we had the only algorithm I know of that I believe has credible CPU mining

[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> is their website


[04-Dec-18 01:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> $2500 for a miner


[04-Dec-18 01:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> not cheap, but its the cheapest FPGA I have found


[04-Dec-18 01:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <eNOz> that is avaialble


[04-Dec-18 01:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> some things we need to do are attenuate FPGAs, boost relative perf of CPUs, and there is a GPU dev that has beat Chris's numbers, so that will help GPUs as well when it gets in. The algo change can improve the first and second, though we don't have a guarantee, and the new GPU dev has also agreed to follow the new algo once we agree on a bounty. if we choose to stop them, it makes us a more expensive algorithm for any hardware, which just puts it out of reach of more people when someone eventually cracks it. then if we can fork again, the same thing happens to another level.


[04-Dec-18 01:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> if we get agreement, there would be an even less expensive option as well.


[04-Dec-18 01:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Nothing can match FPGA. Mining GPU and CPU is not wroth electricity. It will get worse as it goes along, even with a slight boost in performance or small limits. Its like mining bit coin with a gpu. Its finished. Its all FPGA now


[04-Dec-18 01:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we have not agreed, so please understand that all options are still on the table for us. if we fork away from these, an investment now might need to be directed at another coin, and if we agree, you might have some additional purchase options.


[04-Dec-18 01:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> what do you mean additional purchase options?


[04-Dec-18 01:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> lower price of entry for same economics is the goal


[04-Dec-18 01:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> and what do you mean by anther coin verus 2.0?

[04-Dec-18 01:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Basically if it's going to happen anyway we might as well find a way to make the transition as seamless as possible

[04-Dec-18 01:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I still dont understand the point of cooperating. Its like asking a robber to only take half so he can rob us next week

[dscrdvrsc] <Ted> the point of cooperating


[04-Dec-18 01:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> too right @Ted I agree. So, what is the point of cooperating?


[04-Dec-18 01:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> how is it a robber? they are like an nVidia of a sort, specialized on mining, have sold to people in a way none of us like, but are obviously capable and targeting many coins. if they open source their VerusHash design, so the community can implement it on other hardware if they don't serve the community well, they have done us a favor to offer us a path onto hardware that isn't prohibitively expensive. the question is whether they will really cooperate or not. i don't see how they take more by cooperating. we could fork away, but i think it has a higher cost to the project than if we find a solution that protects us from having this happen in the future. at least until the first ASICs, which are MUCH more expensive to make than FPGA bitstreams.


[04-Dec-18 01:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> 1. They are making money at our expense. 2. Why do we want to be on centralised hardware at this stage of the project? It seems harmful to me. They will manipulate the price or do pump and dump. 3. I dont see how even agreeing with a cooperation deal is good for us because the future FPGAs bitstreams wont have to agree with it. 4. If they are making a killing and the are worried about a fork. Why would they want a deal? They would just want to make as much coin as possible before its forked. @miketout

It wd be bawss on another level if verus was the original AND the blackmarket controller in a way that ultimately did nothing but advance the vision. Do you see a possibility in the future of Verus foundation bankrolling the highest quality fpgas that transformed the duopoly of cpu/gpu into a sustainable triumvirate of cpu/gpu/fpga that evened thi gs out across the spectrum, heralding the dawn of a glorious epoch in which paeon and rich man, serf and baron, mine side by side in harmony for the betterment of all???!

If these guys are selling verus on exchanges at least they‚Äôre creating volume right? I mean it might sound dumbs but usage is usage at any price


[04-Dec-18 01:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I am not personally against FPGA miners, just like I'm not against companies, businesses and government. But you shouldn't let them take more of what you put in. Its a financial game. So, we either let them tax us more or out compete us or we do something about it.


[04-Dec-18 01:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> If we cant outcompete them, then so be it. I will just pull out while I'm still ahead.


[04-Dec-18 01:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Standard gpu miner: If you dont fork those fpga/asics of the net, i will dump my coins. I swear, ill do it üòÖ


[04-Dec-18 01:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Ignoring AAcoin, the volume on Digital price has actually been trending down it seems. Price average is up from a few months ago(I was buying at 2500 sats, now it's hovering between 35-4k) Stex volume is pretty low


[04-Dec-18 01:48 AM] actionslacks#4072
Just think of it as a turbocharged transaction/mining test. You can pull the rug out and see what happens, but maybe in some weird subversive way they are actually increasing adoption.


[04-Dec-18 01:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Gloryman why is FPGA hardware inherently centralized? i think it is the way mining is likely to go. there are FPGAs with RAM and more, they are just too expensive right now. i think what is happening is part of a market evolution towards the investment being focused on mining vs. more general purpose use diluting the ROI. as FPGAs get more sophisticated and people push the envelope of the opportunity to do better on coins without hardware, it is a niche that is emerging as a profitable approach. i think this trend may continue, and i think it will become more and more decentralized. the more we can depend on the FPGA perf than RAM and all of the other components, the smaller and more decentralized we will be able to get if that's true. I still want to work towards CPU and GPU being worth enough for me to keep mining with them, and with PBaaS, there will be new rewards over and above the block reward.


[04-Dec-18 01:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Why can't you just sell your GPUs(or move them to another coin) and buy an fgpa? Why am I even asking


[04-Dec-18 01:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Yeah i dont get that part either. A good rig costs more than a fpga ü§î


[04-Dec-18 01:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> You buy 2 2080 and have one fpga üòÖ


[04-Dec-18 01:52 AM] actionslacks#4072
Getting worked up over 1k sats up or down seems a little reactionary. Especially in this market.


[04-Dec-18 01:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> But at least the fpga makes some money and dont loses money every day....


[04-Dec-18 01:53 AM] actionslacks#4072
Is there a profitable coin left to mine with gpu‚Äôs right now?


[04-Dec-18 01:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> The order books for verus are so thin a few thousand moves the price significantly. It spiked up to 9-10k a little while back, but that was very brief.


[04-Dec-18 01:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @miketout I have nothing against FPGA miners. I want to buy them in future. It is not inherently centralised. But the jump in the hash rate means that this coin is very much in control by a few miner. That means that they decide the price. And the more they mine the more control they will have through staking. When you have this much coin controlled by so few people, this is where the problem occurs. I dont mind FPGA miners being part of the long term vision. But at this stage us cut out all new miners and casual people interested. The only people coming to this coin will be FPGA miners that want to make as much money  as quickly as possible and traders who want to make as much money as fast as possible.


[04-Dec-18 01:54 AM] actionslacks#4072
Ahh yes, the American way


[04-Dec-18 01:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> And casual just hodl the coin, trading dies, way better


[04-Dec-18 01:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> they may have had a month starting small and growing to take some percentage of the 50% that is PoW so far. they didn't centralize the supply, and if both they and we make good decisions now, they will sell miners, but won't centralize Verus Coin and neither will the next one who comes along, as we will be pre-FPGA'ed


[04-Dec-18 01:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> You cant possible know how many people mined with their gpu/cpu as you dont know how many people are mining with fpgas now


[04-Dec-18 01:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> I was attempting to inject some levity into the discussion. My question, @miketout is this- since youre being rational and clear eyed about the inevitability of these high capacity miners, all towards the ultimate safeguarding of the Verus vision, cld you take it one step further and actually have Verus ITSELF put out the best, leading fpgas that wd keep the ecosystem stable between not only the original vision of cpus and gpus, but now making room for fpgas? I ask bcos it cld be a means of staying ahead of what I see as having to continually pay sort of a "protection" fee to companies that come up with this hardware. If verus made or bankrolled  the best ones on the market, that wd automatically default the ecosystem back to the original vision of fairness amongst everyday, non commercial community members/regular miners. Sure, some "market share" so to speak wd be siphoned away from gpus and esp cpus, but this new balance wd def leave them better off, since verus wd be the main distributor of these machines, and thus wd have the community's best interest at heart, while still achieving the required decentralization.


[04-Dec-18 01:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i also tend to believe them from what I've seen on their Discord that their customers, not them have been mining Verus, meaning maybe we even have a few new members of the community who might even contribute at some point that got in for the opportunity


[04-Dec-18 01:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @miketout it will be 100% soon, no one else can compete. That's what I mean. Casual miners out and casual users out. Only players left will be FPGA miners and day traders.


[04-Dec-18 01:58 AM] actionslacks#4072
I think sia coin and decred both sold their own mining rigs.


[04-Dec-18 01:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> "No one else can compete" 

Anyone can buy the miner though


[04-Dec-18 01:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @jintaa ah


[04-Dec-18 01:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Siacoin did. They changed asic algo to only their own asics. THAT is cenralized.


[04-Dec-18 01:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> The people over there are mostly small gpu miner. Some are mining verus, but some are also mining other coins, way less profitable coins as they believe in their project and dont care about profit right away


[04-Dec-18 02:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Personally, I care more about whether something works than whether it's centralized or not


[04-Dec-18 02:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Main reason I use centralized exchanges far more than I use dexes


[04-Dec-18 02:02 AM] actionslacks#4072
They cant take over the chain and do double spends thanks to dpow. If they drive the price down into the dirt they‚Äôll likely have to move on to something more profitable sooner or later. Maybe the problem will fix itself.


[04-Dec-18 02:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Why would they tank the price? Need to pay for the hardware somehow


[04-Dec-18 02:04 AM] actionslacks#4072
Thats what i mean, if they get too greedy they‚Äôll shoot themselves in the foot. Maybe the market do it‚Äôs job.


[04-Dec-18 02:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we actually have had someone who hasn't been full time working on an FPGA design. we also have now three more people who said they could do one. the thing is, HashAltCoins have done it on this algorithm, proving they are capable, and have a business interest to do it well for the community and more sales if we can cooperate. one of the conditions is that they make a reference version open. The foundation would also offer them a time locked bounty for following the algorithm and making it open, so they will have an ongoing future stake in Verus Coin through this transition.


[04-Dec-18 02:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Yii Yes everyone is mining for fun, not profit


[04-Dec-18 02:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> What is the incentive for FPGAs to have the interest of the coin or community. They want to make a killing on the coin and move on to the next one. Its that simple.


[04-Dec-18 02:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Haven‚Äôt they already been mining their bounty? üòâ Seriously though, I‚Äôd like to be introduced to fpga, so I‚Äôm not totally against the idea. But I don‚Äôt see why versus has to comply with fpga if that agreement is months away.


[04-Dec-18 02:08 AM] actionslacks#4072
Well if they have the best tech, they will be rewarded. And yes perhaps they will move on. In the meantime. I may be a customer in the near future.


[04-Dec-18 02:09 AM] actionslacks#4072
Maybe they‚Äôll take verus as payment!


[04-Dec-18 02:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> @Matterbridge , you Judas! ü§£


[04-Dec-18 02:13 AM] actionslacks#4072
This is the first mention I have seen of this company. This may also be a trading opportunity if their tech is really that superior. I highly doubt verus is the only coin they are capable of dominating right now.


[04-Dec-18 02:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> The tech is not superior, the other bitstream devs just suck balls right now


[04-Dec-18 02:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> @Gloryman, I get your point, but pls at some point, I hope you're actually reading what Mike is saying. He's saying this is coming, and in his opinion, the best option is to work with them. It's sort of a trust and verify set up. I think one thing he's saying that you're not appreciating is it's not going to be that easy to just declare all out war on the fpga company and fork the algo. It's gonna take up too much time and resources, and just get worse as most of the development will start being directed to being an endless forking project. If the project can cooperate now, it not only solves this immediate stuation, but ameliorates the inevitable issues that will rear their heads down the line because of the new economics created by coolerating with this company..does that make sense...?


[04-Dec-18 02:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @miketout I am not blaming mike. He needs to do what is best for his company and development team. But as a casual miner and someone interested in the project, I believe that this will damage the project for casual miners and casual people interested in the project. So, I'm getting out before the coins will be all mined by FPGAs and control the prices/run down the price.


[04-Dec-18 02:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @miketout I think we are missing something. This community is currently built around CPU and GPU miners that cooperate to mine the coin. If we decide that FPGAs are ok, and don't fork, we are basically cutting 80% of the community from the PoW supply as currently a single 2500$ specialized mining hardware is mining more hash than ~160x GTX 1060 GPU farm, forget the small CPU miners or single GPU miners that will not even get a dust as reward for their mining. Actually, that single unit of FPGA represents and average of ~100 people mining casually with their high end CPUs or ~5000 people mining with their typical notebook CPU. I have no problem with the existence of FPGAs, I have a problem with cutting any economic incentive for regular people to get involved when we basically are extremely early and have no big community. If we say ok to the FPGAs, we are fine with ASICs too by default - so we just want more hashrate for the network and are not interested in casual miners or non-miners that are willing to start their journey. The question in here is - are we really mature enough to cut the PoW mining as a way to get involved? Are we really already there? Bitcoin is not mineable at home, ETH is not mineable at home, but those networks are mature, have worldwide community and so on. Are we not afraid that we will kill the growth of our community with the exclusion of any PoW mining incentive? No one will run their CPU for months to get a single coin worth pennies. I am really afraid we are not ready for any other move than hard forking the FPGAs out of the network at the current state of the community.


[04-Dec-18 02:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I'm actually in the process of saving up for an FPGA. So, maybe I will be the next group of miners making money on your ran down price VRSC, lol


[04-Dec-18 02:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Ran down price? Not born out by evidence


[04-Dec-18 02:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> producing something more efficiently is increasing supply. you can do the maths


[04-Dec-18 02:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> Supply is fixed and the difficulty will not impact it.


[04-Dec-18 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Post> jup, doesnt matter if 1 MHs or 1 THs is on the net


[04-Dec-18 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> The supply structure is at stake, not the supply volume.


[04-Dec-18 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> If they run down the price, I will buy more and stake more and make more


[04-Dec-18 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> Price is no issue at all imo


[04-Dec-18 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <basti> staking is the free fpga


[04-Dec-18 02:26 AM] actionslacks#4072
Think of it as buying real estate, and the price just went down temporarily


[04-Dec-18 02:28 AM] actionslacks#4072
If you believe in the project and want to support it, invest in it. Buying crypto right now is universally cheaper than mining it


[04-Dec-18 02:28 AM] actionslacks#4072
At this moment in time


[04-Dec-18 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @ok88 Oh, I see. Supply stays the same but the supply is limited to just FPGA miners, as they are the only ones who can afford it.


[04-Dec-18 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> You are talking against your own arguments here man.


[04-Dec-18 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> On one hand you are claiming they will tank the price, but then on the other hand you are saying they will be the only ones who can afford it


[04-Dec-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> yeah, I was wrong about supply point but the FPGA miners gettin coins for so cheap will run down price as they can sell for much cheaper than everyone else


[04-Dec-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> So can people who were getting bigger block rewards


[04-Dec-18 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Either way your arguments contradict each other


[04-Dec-18 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> afford to mine it not afford to buy it


[04-Dec-18 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Gloryman there is no company. this is a community project, and i am not working for a for-profit company. i get bounties from the Foundation that I helped create, and the foundation pays much more in total to other community members. It also helps cover things like listing fees for the community, nodes, and more. Finally, it uses its funds for critical things like this for the benefit of the project and community, not for a profit.


[04-Dec-18 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> If they run down the price, you buy it and stake it.


[04-Dec-18 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> You don't need to mine it


[04-Dec-18 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> My cost basis is pretty close to 0 at this point and I haven't mined a single coin


[04-Dec-18 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> when someone mines and sells, they are distributing the coins to people who can stake.


[04-Dec-18 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Yeah, that's fine @Patrick ManBearPig . So you agree with me. FPGAs will mine and other wont. Then traders will come and try to buy and sell coin for profit instead of casual miners and interested people. We agreed?


[04-Dec-18 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I think people will do what makes sense for them. Mining does not make sense for me so I don't mine.


[04-Dec-18 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @miketout Thats what I'm saying. It will be for FPGA's and savy traders


[04-Dec-18 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I definitely don't consider myself a savy trader


[04-Dec-18 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> and unsavy traders then üòâ


[04-Dec-18 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I was smarter 20 years ago. Dumber too though


[04-Dec-18 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> for casual mining, we haven't given up. i see everyone else has, but i am hoping we can close the gap enough to have casual miners and more professional miners, as well as stakers of course. when PBaaS comes, we will be happy to have many people who consider themselves serious miners decentralized on the network, as more resources will mean more network capacity


[04-Dec-18 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> By the way @miketout . I dont believe that everyone is into the VRSC community because of altruism, or part of the foundation for that reason.


[04-Dec-18 02:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Gloryman I don't either, and I hope and expect many businesses will be able to be built on Verus Coin over time. just the protocol itself is not the business.

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i'm going to have to üò¥ , but there is one thing that we are definitely not focused on, and that means something that is easy to ignore.

[04-Dec-18 02:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <evilwar> Input from a small miner here: I only have around $700 worth of mining hardware so I can't make much from mining. I joined Verus in the beginning because it was enticing from a small miner to actually be able to make some decent coin. I stuck around because of the community and have no regrets, and will continue to mine. I think a lot of smaller/ new users of crypto might have the same mindset as me. "Oh look something I can make beer money with, neat." I feel if Verus allows fpgas to continue then that would be the end of any new users being enticed into trying out the coin and thus wouldn't stick around to find out how awesome the community we have built is. I don't feel that would mean Verus would fail, but I think it would slow our growth. Just my 2 cents.

[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @Patrick ManBearPig for some people, this is actually a lot of VRSC sir. Mining that 500 VRSC with current difficulty means running your typical gaming CPU and top shelf GPU on home PC for over a year ... So just understand his side üòâ And 5 years, for typical notebook ^^


[04-Dec-18 02:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I'm not saying that to belittle the amount of coins, but that with 500 coins and the current market situation why rush to action?

[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> what do you mean @Patrick ManBearPig ?


[04-Dec-18 02:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> No, because its a good time to seel


[04-Dec-18 02:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Or set a sell order at 10k sats


[04-Dec-18 02:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> sell


[04-Dec-18 02:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Patrick ManBearPig I am as soon as i figure out how to use the exchange, lol


[04-Dec-18 02:52 AM] actionslacks#4072
You could buy 500 for around $80


[04-Dec-18 02:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I had to sell some and cash out recently because I need the fiat, and it suckssss


[04-Dec-18 02:53 AM] actionslacks#4072
Its not rocket science


[04-Dec-18 02:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Is this fpga datacenter or whatever in China? They should let me go visit


[04-Dec-18 02:56 AM] actionslacks#4072
The bull market is over for now, there is no more low hanging fruit anywhere in crypto town


[04-Dec-18 02:56 AM] actionslacks#4072
You either believe in it and buy with both fists, or you go home.

When and if the next bull market comes around, you cash out or keep hodling. Rinse and repeat ad infinitum

I‚Äôm about 5yrs into this fantastic disaster/paradigm shift, and I‚Äôve missed out on enough profit to have set me up for life. But I‚Äôve taken some as well. I‚Äôm in it because I know this technology will change the world for the better. Guys like miketout are doing what they believe in. If you dont, then by all means do  something you believe in instead.

[04-Dec-18 05:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> I may be wrong but focusing on the algo-miner race is a distraction if anything. Decentralization will never be perfect. It's just enough if it is good enough. Decentralization was ment for double spend protection and abusers - and this is already fine as dPOW works for Verus? Or not? So in my opinion does not matter what algo you use, but if you believe it's most important you will never finish the key features, just be participating in algo-miner race like all the other small coins, that believe they are sth because of the algo. No they are not. The thing is to bring a new tool or new solution, like voting, and focusing on anything else for too much time is just delaying the true features to infinity. First time when I saw Verus project I though - really cool, let's watch it. Then I saw first few months they do not discuss how to make a better democracy - they discuss wallets and mining... same  waste as other projects... Nothing new = miners, wallets problems, hashing algos... nothing about voting.

[04-Dec-18 05:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> my 2 cents: nobody runs a datacenter in his house and sell cloud services; why a blockchain service should behave differently? Today, almost every company has shifted to an infrastructure as a service (even Verus wants to be aaS); why Verus "product" should be affected by miners? From a "product" view, imho, mining is exactly the same as powering on a server, it serves to a purpose (the service) not the other way üòÉ @miketout I would focus on delivering the "product", shifting the paradigm from mining for profit to mining because it is needed to run a service. I may be wrong, but no real product/service can rely on storage room miners üòõ


[04-Dec-18 06:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yes but let's say hypothetically all the miners leave and all the people who are originally interested in this project and all that is left is one man sitting in a room with his fpga- would you call that decentralization?


[04-Dec-18 06:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'm absolutely not saying that's the case to be clear but as a hypothetical it is still a possible problem


[04-Dec-18 06:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> At this early stage I think it's important for the hash to be as spread out as possible but I believe verus wil turn out okay either way as I agree with what you said in that verus will be a valuable asset regardless


[04-Dec-18 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Diabolik If you want a service (currency) run by one organisation, why not use dollar.


[04-Dec-18 06:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> @Godballz In your hypothetical scenario, do all the stakers leave too?


[04-Dec-18 06:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> And why would there only be 1 guy with 1 fpga?


[04-Dec-18 06:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> These rhetorical scenarios don't make much sense


[04-Dec-18 06:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> @Gloryman  Currency? Last time I read Verus's vision, currency wasn't part of it üòÉ I'm interested in a secure poll platforms where an end user can retain all personal informations and still be "authenticated". When I turn on a server on AWS, I don't care if it is made by Dell or HP or custom made with paper and scissors, I only care it suits my needs and it is able to provide the underlying layer. To provide a blockchain corporate service (either US national election or rents hamsters to kids)  mining is absolutely useless (you don't mine ripple or vechain). Please, let me underline "corporate service";

everybody likes decentralization but would you accept, from your employer, a "sorry XXX, we have paid your monthly salary but all miners left to a more profitable coin and we are unable to process your transaction; maybe we will be luckier next month"


[04-Dec-18 06:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> @Diabolik all hardware is backdoored. It will not take long until Amazon starts censoring (open source) competitors.


[04-Dec-18 06:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> They only know about one thing - $$$$


[04-Dec-18 06:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Diabolik I agree with you about the service being the most important thing. I'm not saying that the service will be worse with that vision in mind. What I am saying is the currency will be largely adopted by FPGA miners and traders and not casual miners or service users. So, in effect the service wont grow as quickly. Just my opinion, call me stupid if you want.


[04-Dec-18 06:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> what percentage of BTC users are BTC miners??


[04-Dec-18 06:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> it is actually ok if the miners are a separate group than the ones using a coin


[04-Dec-18 06:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @jl777c I agree in mature coins. But not when you are trying encourage new adopters in my opinion


[04-Dec-18 06:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> mining is not a required part of adoption, that is where you seem to be going totally offbase


[04-Dec-18 06:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> I may be biased, but I really can't understand how (and why) a blockchain benefits from an unrealiable tech infrastructure. What if tomorrow I deliver the Diabolik super coin and all miners switch from bitcoin to mine? You may think it is impossible/idiot but a company needs to rely on something more "stable"


[04-Dec-18 06:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> VTC is suffering a 51% attack, even though they are "ASIC resistant"


[04-Dec-18 06:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> ASIC resistant just means there is no publicly sold ASIC (FPGA)


[04-Dec-18 06:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> ultimately the coin security is best if there are FPGA and ASIC actively mining the coin


[04-Dec-18 06:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @jl777c I agree


[04-Dec-18 06:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> so short term, there will be a shift in  miner demographics. long term VRSC becomes even more secure, faster than expected


[04-Dec-18 06:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> How do you "guarantee" that the miners you need to secure your coin will stay here for the next 48 months?


[04-Dec-18 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @jl777c I agree, very long term its fine, imo


[04-Dec-18 07:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> having a market price guarantees there will be some miners


[04-Dec-18 07:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> @jl777c would you use (and pay monthly) a phone provider under the following assumption: you may or may not be able to call; it really depends on how much appeal we have on the people running our gsm network

[04-Dec-18 07:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Some projects seem to think people will do something similar-- Skycoin for example. Internet based on blockchain


[04-Dec-18 07:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> so many people following  "BSV vision" = crypto is about miners - is the same as computers are about developers


[04-Dec-18 07:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> after thinking a bit actualyl I find mining is always "selfish"  (exceptions are neive people who believe otherwise). Miner mines because there exist profit, and as long as it exist profit and this profit is public knowledge it's natural assumptions there will be many miners.


[04-Dec-18 07:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Searching the fpga discord for algo1 brings up some interesting reads. Example:

where is the nethash now?

[dscrdvrsc] <halpi> Does everyone have problems with vrsc transactions?


[04-Dec-18 07:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> I'm over the naive thinking miners are  about "supporting community". They are for profit, many of them for short term profit.


[04-Dec-18 07:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> Dont get me wrong - nothing bad in profit, just let's not make miners the center of it.


[04-Dec-18 07:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I think the fpga freakout is much ado about nothing maybe

"$11.55 revenue for Algo1 minus some for electricity makes it $10.49 at the moment."

3 blocks a day.


[04-Dec-18 07:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I wonder if their outage is why I had such some killer staking days recently


[04-Dec-18 07:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I think a big part of the issue is that there are several different arguments going on not just a black and white thing. I find it an interesting ride being a part of this community even still and I have my opinions just like everyone else but I also like to keep an open mind and where some people are anti fpga and some people are pro fpga I am not completely sure where I stand just yet but I will say my concern with the fpga thing is how it might affect not only coin distribution but price if people are able to mine them very cheaply then they are competing against each other to sell them very cheaply keeping the price down which isn't necessarily bad for buyers. It is just a lot of variables and the stakes are somewhat high for some


[04-Dec-18 07:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Or if their existence is why I have been


[04-Dec-18 07:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I think that is where a lot of this friction is coming from


[04-Dec-18 07:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> And I will say personally reading the quote from the fpga Discord sort of rubs me the wrong way how about how they have been going about what they are doing


[04-Dec-18 07:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Understandable. On the other hand it is a privacy coin, right? So can we really begrudge people for being private about it?


[04-Dec-18 07:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> My gut reaction was the same on reading that, and reading the announcement today. "Fuck them!"


[04-Dec-18 07:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I feel like that's a little like saying he's a magician he makes things disappear he won't mind that I took his wallet


[04-Dec-18 07:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> But I get your point and it doesn't bother me so much as what the repercussions might be


[04-Dec-18 07:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Now a question becomes- is it worth it to sell off your vrsc in order to buy an fpga considering if things stay the same it would be possible to make them back within the first 6 months?


[04-Dec-18 07:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> The economics shift a little


[04-Dec-18 07:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I have days when I stake that much and I did not spend $2500


[04-Dec-18 07:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I mean yes... sell all your VRSC please


[04-Dec-18 07:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Everyone buy fpgas and stop staking


[04-Dec-18 07:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I didn't say I was going to. I said it becomes a question as a matter of economics

[04-Dec-18 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> 5000 bcus were sold


[04-Dec-18 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> well 4000 with a remianing 1000 left


[04-Dec-18 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> countless others coming


[04-Dec-18 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> no where near the same as an antminer

[04-Dec-18 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> what is the capital recapture for CPU or GPU?


[04-Dec-18 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> 1 bitstream atm for bcu on shell @TJay


[04-Dec-18 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> dont get me wrong id love for you to cause fud


[04-Dec-18 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> more $$ for me


[04-Dec-18 08:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TJay> @Honey dude,i know pretty well this situation. will compare our predictions after 1-2 months.
FUD? this is arguments, not a fud


[04-Dec-18 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> im not disagreeing with you


[04-Dec-18 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TJay> and btw, bcus was advertised with 30 bucks a day profit. now it's about 4 bucks


[04-Dec-18 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> i know youre everywhere just like me


[04-Dec-18 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> in terms of risk 100% agree as risky as asic, slightly less due to changing algos but still


[04-Dec-18 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TJay> lyra2z was destroyed just within month. and this was a very huge algo in terms of $/day pow emission


[04-Dec-18 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> but its not going to become a paper weight as fast


[04-Dec-18 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> for sure it was


[04-Dec-18 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> lyra2z got nuked


[04-Dec-18 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> and that is the danger of "ASIC resistance", it just delays the arrival of ASIC (FPGA) and it seems a bit more controlled if mainstream ASIC are available vs. fpga


[04-Dec-18 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TJay> hardware manufacturers earn money, 90% of miners lose money. this is how mining works ))


[04-Dec-18 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @jl777c at current-ish conditions, best case for capital recapture is about 1-1.5yrs for most efficient CPU vrsc mining. I think that is now out the window that FPGAs are on the network. FPGA cost recapture time isn't great, but it seems they will ruin it for all the CPU/GPUs on the network


[04-Dec-18 09:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Pallas> Please add to blockfolio


[04-Dec-18 09:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> then what we need are even more efficient ASIC


[04-Dec-18 09:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Pallas> FPGA (and thus ASIC) resistance is possible. Just look at monero. We are doing the same on suqa.


[04-Dec-18 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @Pallas the core protection SUQA has, is that it uses more algos than can currently fit into 1 fpga memory, am I understanding that?


[04-Dec-18 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> what is the real protection, that somebody who wants to mine SUQA with fpga's, will be stopped?


[04-Dec-18 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Pallas> Yes, and changing the algorithm periodically


[04-Dec-18 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> I see people combining CPUs/GPUs + FPGAs to mine some coins


[04-Dec-18 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @Pallas changing your algo means every pool + exchange needs to update. It can't be done very often


[04-Dec-18 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Pallas> Monero does it


[04-Dec-18 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> what if fpga devs can make new bitstreams faster than you can update?


[04-Dec-18 09:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> and who knows for sure, that there are no private FPGAs for XMR? updated every 6 months, hours after the hard fork


[04-Dec-18 09:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Pallas> They won't, because it's a lot of work to mine for a few weeks


[04-Dec-18 09:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Pallas> It takes weeks to develop a bitstream


[04-Dec-18 09:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> sure, about the same to upgrade a p2p network securely


[04-Dec-18 09:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> I don't see the big advantage, of any coin, or SUQA, to stop FPGA's


[04-Dec-18 09:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Pallas> But you can develop all the software without revealing the algorithm details


[04-Dec-18 09:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Pallas> So the FPGA devs can never catch up


[04-Dec-18 09:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> FPGAs can mine in secret, and you will never know if your current algo can be FPGA mined, if miners stay discreet


[04-Dec-18 09:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Pallas> It is like 51% attacks: the best protection is making them unprofitable


[04-Dec-18 09:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> you know when a 51% attack is happening


[04-Dec-18 09:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Pallas> You can't know if there is a small FPGA miner just like you can't know if there is a small optimised GPU miner


[04-Dec-18 09:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> it basically seems like cat-and-mouse, I don't see coin devs as having any advantage, like with ASICs that can be bricked


[04-Dec-18 09:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Pallas> Let's take the suqa case: a FPGA developer would need to develop 3/4 new algorithms, make it work on multiple boards, with 4 times the memory requirements of the usual X algorithm, and all this knowing that in a few months it's all to be done again.


[04-Dec-18 09:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> maybe. I have heard of FPGA miners for XMR


[04-Dec-18 09:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> it just wont be publicly advertised


[04-Dec-18 09:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> and not really any way to detect


[04-Dec-18 09:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Honey> theres lots of scammy crap out there one company claims 2.1ghs on eth. no working hardware tho


[04-Dec-18 09:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @Pallas i am no expert, but FPGAs with ddr4 sdram slots are coming, so your algos will need to balloon in memory size very soon. Extra memory use doesn't seem like the stronger factor, it seems that you are mostly relying on the fact that you can change your algorithm faster than FPGA devs can update their bitstreams


[04-Dec-18 09:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> how much faster? Is that edge defendable? Against a team of fpga devs at a company/fund who's only purpose is to secretly mine with custom fpga's?

[04-Dec-18 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> interesting. the thing is that people don't seem to understand the issue of relative performance, and we have people opposed to solutions here as well. if all FPGAs can only get 100 hashes/second, they would still each have the same return if they are alone in the world and competing with each other. the people there, who i assume are only some of them and based on our discussions, not the company, seem upset that they may have to accept casual miners having a chance to make anything over time. any performance change on FPGAs won't affect them relative to other FPGAs, so there actually isn't any argument except not wanting any other devices to have a chance. the goal for what we're working to achieve if we do come to agreement is casual miners can still help decentralize and professional miners would get best ROI with FPGAs. if those specific people don't want to mine Verus because of that, then the more for everyone else.


[04-Dec-18 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> What I don't get is why would they rather burn it all down than compromise? Suggesting a fork is like cutting the baby in half


[04-Dec-18 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I don't think they are accepting the long-term benefit to a compromise. Rather than sacrifice some now they may end up left in the dust if/when big players get in


[04-Dec-18 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BigCat45> Because of bitstreams. There are huge resources involved in making those work. Going opensource can lead to a lot of people making their own FPGAs -> lost (potential) revenue to the company.


[04-Dec-18 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I like the idea of a compromise if only for the idea of spreading the hash. Mining was great while it lasted but that happens with all successful coins eventually and at least staking generates consistent Rewards


[04-Dec-18 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Do you mean for other algorithms? Or for vrsc? If they were to release the bit stream for vrsc with that compromise anything else?


[04-Dec-18 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BigCat45> VRSC


[04-Dec-18 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Right so then there is no harm


[04-Dec-18 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> A fork would mean it is off the table entirely


[04-Dec-18 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BigCat45> not really. majority of bitstreams can be adjusted to the new algo. If they show VH to the world, a lot of people would have a huge advantage, therefore they offer huge time-locked bounty from the foundation


[04-Dec-18 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> #mining on the HAC discord seems to say VRSC is free to fork if they don't like FPGAs, and they will update their bitstreams. Cat-and-mouse game, engage.


[04-Dec-18 01:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BigCat45> Fork would just cut F1 users off with higher memory requirement. (Possible) F2 with more memory can handle new algo


[04-Dec-18 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BigCat45> What Mike is proposing is the only usable solution for Verus


[04-Dec-18 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> people have verushash bitstreams for more expensive fpga's, that have lots of RAM


[04-Dec-18 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BigCat45> But they cost way more then 2.5k


[04-Dec-18 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BigCat45> and only one CPU, F1 has 6


[04-Dec-18 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> the ones you know about


[04-Dec-18 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BigCat45> Each FPGA would require custom bitstream = more work


[04-Dec-18 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> people have automated software to convert bitstreams to various FPGAs


[04-Dec-18 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Worst-case short-term what is wrong with forking to something more difficult on fpga and then in the event of a large company getting involved and creating an Asic wouldn't it always be possible to Fork back to the easier algorithm when the time is right and the entire ecosystem is more saturated with fpga thus maintaining decentralization and a healthy spread of the hash


[04-Dec-18 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BigCat45> Can there be true decentralization with encrypted bitstreams?


[04-Dec-18 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> Verus could change VerusHash slightly every few months, it's an annoying solution to mining pools, expensive for exchanges (they charge for updates) but might prevent most people from having bitstreams that worked. But each change to verushash would need to be different and unique, not some tiny change. Or the changed bitstream will be trivial and be available hours after the latest version of verushash is released


[04-Dec-18 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I imagine that is a possible short-term solution and at least levels the playing field


[04-Dec-18 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> Verus would have to try to keep the new version of verushash secret until the latest possible moment, or fpga devs can start coding early


[04-Dec-18 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> is it all worth it?


[04-Dec-18 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> If fpga becomes more available I can understand opening the gates but does anyone know how many of these things are actually out there?


[04-Dec-18 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> Why doesn't verus foundation make their own FPGA and compete? Be better than the competition


[04-Dec-18 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'm going to take a rough guess and say around 22 terahashes


[04-Dec-18 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> and many people would rather give money to VRSC foundation + Mike versus some rando company that only cares about profit, not the coin


[04-Dec-18 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @dukeleto where did you see that info?


[04-Dec-18 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> So the actual core miners make up something like 10 to 15% pow work? That is extremely lopsided


[04-Dec-18 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> 145 MH/s per watt. If you do the math, you will not sleep well


[04-Dec-18 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Until fpga is a common household thing I feel like it is early to be exposed to this


[04-Dec-18 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @John Westbrook what in particular?


[04-Dec-18 01:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> most GPUs get maybe 2-5 MH/s per watt


[04-Dec-18 01:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> CPUs do a bit better. But these FPGAs will completely control the network soon

[04-Dec-18 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> This is a good chance to see the actual pow hashrate and like you mentioned that doesn't even include the ones that people ship to their house


[04-Dec-18 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> By the way guys it's a great time to get us mining back on


[04-Dec-18 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Some fpgas are not currently on the network


[04-Dec-18 01:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> We are probably closer to 5 terahashes than 30


[04-Dec-18 01:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I got a coin in 2 hours so it's like 13-14 Coins a day


[04-Dec-18 01:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Close to ¬£1.50


[04-Dec-18 01:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> So more than 10 x


[04-Dec-18 01:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <DigitalCruncher> Guys, if you choose AES based POW, there is completely no point to stick to GPU. FPGA is much faster and efficient.


[04-Dec-18 01:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That could mean fpga control more than 90% pow coins


[04-Dec-18 01:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @DigitalCruncher agreed, unless they are offline, lok


[04-Dec-18 01:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> from what I understand, these F1's are "starter kits", big FPGA miners use PCIe fpga's, that are $5-10K each. They can mine VerusHash on those too, it's just not setup to be as easy as possible. So just trying to make the F1 not able to mine VRSC, it's not quite a good solution. It prevents small hobbyist fpga miners, and allows the biggest fpga miners with most expensive equipment to continue


[04-Dec-18 01:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> "hobbyist fpga miners" are the new GPU miners


[04-Dec-18 01:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Godballz it will be close to 100% when people look at their lecky price


[04-Dec-18 01:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yeah so I think it's hard to say it's not really a problem it's extremely skewed


[04-Dec-18 01:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @dukeleto I agree, the whole thing needs forking


[04-Dec-18 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> ?


[04-Dec-18 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That means nearly half of all coinbase rewards will soon go into the hands of fpga


[04-Dec-18 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> many Blackminer F1 current owners, on discord, are complaining that their rewards on VRSC drastically went down in the last few days


[04-Dec-18 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> they are angry that more people are getting FPGA's, ruining their daily profits


[04-Dec-18 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Haha,


[04-Dec-18 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I saw that


[04-Dec-18 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> the company quoted $14/day profit mining VRSC, as of 11/28/2018


[04-Dec-18 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> they call it "algo1" everywhere


[04-Dec-18 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> it's down to around $5 or less, i heard


[04-Dec-18 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> those numbers use a 0.10/kwh elec cost, as per their hosting


[04-Dec-18 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Yeah, so they can just mine something else I guedd


[04-Dec-18 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Perhaps they will ruin a good thing and find some other coin to suck off of


[04-Dec-18 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Godballz hahahaha


[04-Dec-18 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Probably


[04-Dec-18 01:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> VerusHash seems to be one of the most power efficient algorithms to run on the F1


[04-Dec-18 01:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @dukeleto you mentioned there are more powerful fpgas with more ram which are also currently mining vrsc. what is your source for that comment?


[04-Dec-18 01:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @John Westbrook the internet


[04-Dec-18 01:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> F1's are very tiny/inexpensive FPGAs, is one point. There exist "pro" FPGAs, that cost more than your car


[04-Dec-18 01:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> Those FPGAs, people can program to mine any coin. Like Verus


[04-Dec-18 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> those people don't share their bitstreams, they write them for themselves, and paid customers, and maybe hedge funds or VC people


[04-Dec-18 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> Blackminer F1 is like the iphone, but some people use ham radio

[04-Dec-18 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> that is probably a $50K fpga rig


[04-Dec-18 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> you can reprogram it while it's running


[04-Dec-18 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> i don't even have to power down my machine to follow your fork, when I have the right bitstream


[04-Dec-18 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> if I owned such a thing üòÉ I don't.


[04-Dec-18 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Yeah, I have watched many videos of people with super expensive fpga rigs and talking about private bitstreams and secret bitstreams


[04-Dec-18 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Think logically, if someone had a killer algo, why share it early?


[04-Dec-18 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> the above evidence shows, if you just knock off F1s from the network, you are just disabling the tiniest FPGA's


[04-Dec-18 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> you are not disabling professional FPGAs


[04-Dec-18 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> concentrating the power into smaller group of richer miners is worse, right?


[04-Dec-18 01:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> I thought you said "people have verushash bitstreams for more expensive fpgas..."


[04-Dec-18 01:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @dukeleto depends on the affect on the community.


[04-Dec-18 01:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> who has verushash bitstreams for more expensive fpgas?


[04-Dec-18 01:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> I did say that. It's a very reasonable estimation. I have no proof written in blood for you


[04-Dec-18 01:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> lol, not after your blood


[04-Dec-18 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> Whoever writes them will make lots of money, therefore somebody has written it or is writing it.


[04-Dec-18 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @dukeleto I believe the same thing after looking at the videos of fpga rigs.


[04-Dec-18 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Until fpga becomes mainstream they are just decentralization vampires. It seems foolish to leave nearly half of verus hash coinbase Rewards to the hands of the few who own fpga that is centralization by definition and seems counterintuitive to what the project began as


[04-Dec-18 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> what is happening now, is FPGAs are becoming trivially easy to use


[04-Dec-18 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> The thing is, fpgas need very skilled developers to creat new algos all the time. So, I doubt the top ones will ever be mainstream. Just half way like f1 miner.


[04-Dec-18 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Do you know how to program an fpga?


[04-Dec-18 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> FPGAs have existed since much before Bitcoin was invented. It's now becoming mainstream. Less optimized than ASICs, but they are so flexible, as to be more useful


[04-Dec-18 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> not trivially to program, trivial to mine with, i should say


[04-Dec-18 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I can't program anything, lol


[04-Dec-18 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Ah, how do you use it?


[04-Dec-18 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> ssh?


[04-Dec-18 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> it acts just like a Z9 mini or similar. Web interface

[04-Dec-18 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> you upload various coins you want to mine, select the coin, and set pool details + mine


[04-Dec-18 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> I've never used any ASIC so I don't have a reference point


[04-Dec-18 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Do you mine to a pool?


[04-Dec-18 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> you can only support a few coins at a time, so you can add and subtract them, even while it's running


[04-Dec-18 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> you create your own pool or mine to a public pool


[04-Dec-18 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Hmm, interesting.


[04-Dec-18 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763

[04-Dec-18 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Is this an "on site" thing you need to handle?


[04-Dec-18 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> that $20/day was verushash, i believe


[04-Dec-18 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @John Westbrook you seem kind of confused, maybe because you haven't mined a bunch. Go look at some YT videos, it should explain how simple they are to use


[04-Dec-18 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> "if the algo changes" is what we have been talking about for the last 16hrs or so üòÉ


[04-Dec-18 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @dukeleto FPGAs are around for a few years, it's just the accessibility that changes now indeed. We did have fpgas in 2013/2014 already. I believe there are good ones that have a solid bitstreams and are mining popular algos. My concern in here is just the fact, that we are such a newb community and quite a fresh coin and that FPGAs right now could really screw us badly in terms of organic growth of community. BTW. they are in the network for over a month now so we should not panic this much, it's done. The question is: do we want to deal with it somehow


[04-Dec-18 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> I only have mined using GPUs and CPUs


[04-Dec-18 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> My question to that end is how easy is it from the interface to update to the next algo


[04-Dec-18 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @ok88 FPGAs existed when I started mining BTC in 2011, only custom built ones by "BTC gods" of the time, like ArtForz


[04-Dec-18 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Is it automated? Do you download it?  I wasn't in this conversation all 16 hours üòÉ


[04-Dec-18 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @John Westbrook clicking 3 buttons, maybe 2


[04-Dec-18 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> it's like installing a new driver on your computer. they call it "flashing a new bitstream"


[04-Dec-18 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> And is bitstream the service they update the algo through to you?


[04-Dec-18 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> a bitstream is just an .exe for an FPGA


[04-Dec-18 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Ah, okay


[04-Dec-18 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> it's a binary executed on the hardware


[04-Dec-18 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Do you have to stop mining to do this?  And for how long?


[04-Dec-18 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @ok88 well the way I felt with it is to sell it all and keep an eye not this project and how it develops


[04-Dec-18 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> you must load the bitstream into the FPGA, for it to execute. Like a bios update


[04-Dec-18 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @John Westbrook like I said, no. You can live update coins, no downtimes


[04-Dec-18 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> live updates is built into the hardware


[04-Dec-18 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Ah, interesting


[04-Dec-18 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> of all FPGAs, it seems


[04-Dec-18 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> Maybe we need to learn from the experience of projects which claim to FPGA resistance? Surely there are ready-made solutions from other projects


[04-Dec-18 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> it's not specific to the blackminer. The FPGA knows how to update it's own BIOS while it's running, essentially


[04-Dec-18 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> a few parts of the FPGA are dedicated to nothing but updating while running


[04-Dec-18 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> We don't need to be FPGA resistant, it's more about maintaining decentralization, accessiblity to new hardware, and reasonable support for casual miners


[04-Dec-18 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @Takoy_Nahal


[04-Dec-18 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @John Westbrook agreed, but can't see how all can be maintained with fpgas


[04-Dec-18 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Cool, thanks for the answers @dukeleto, I have zero experience with an fpga as I said, but sounds like a fun process to learn


[04-Dec-18 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> @John Westbrook Then you want to sit on two chairs


[04-Dec-18 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> constant source code updates to invalidate existing bitstreams. But from the developer perspective, it's a nightmare. Also a nightmare for pools and exchanges


[04-Dec-18 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> exchanges will charge verus money for every update, pools will go down, some pools will not be able to keep up


[04-Dec-18 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> The only viable option I see is Verus Foundation itself making an FPGA miner, that is better in some way. Even if it's about the same, most people would rather give money to Verus community than an fpga company


[04-Dec-18 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> Verus could strategically make a few small changes, on the way there, to give some temporary breathing room. That alone though, is not a full strategy, in my opinion


[04-Dec-18 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> It is impossible to please everyone, I've never seen such a hashing algorithm where fairly distributed coins among CPU, GPU and FGPA miners, it's impossible. Someone will be slighted. So if to choose between two bad options I would have opposed FPGA fully


[04-Dec-18 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Also, by the way, on the topic of hashes and hardware, hope everyone saw @Chris - LOUD Mining Dev-Ops impressive update to ccminer! ~27%  improvement I think?


[04-Dec-18 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> What do you mine with @Takoy_Nahal ?


[04-Dec-18 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> GPU/POS. Now only POS


[04-Dec-18 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @Chris - LOUD Mining Dev-Ops is that just for GPUs, or did CPUs see some improvement too?


[04-Dec-18 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @John Westbrook very impressive. Mine jumped from 1.4 ghz to 1.7 ghs


[04-Dec-18 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Shame it was the same time as fpgas coming out


[04-Dec-18 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Glad you're still staking @Takoy_Nahal üëç


[04-Dec-18 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> It turned out this situation that it was easier to mine another coin , sell it and buy Verus than just to get the Verus. Now hashrate is normal, but for how long


[04-Dec-18 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> I've been mining CPU only, want to do some GPU with the new miner


[04-Dec-18 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> GPU is dead for every coin or will be in 2019


[04-Dec-18 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> I personally do not mind FGPA, I am against the concentration of coins in the hands of a narrow circle of persons


[04-Dec-18 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I need to start selling my vega 64s


[04-Dec-18 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Takoy_Nahal me too, but with fgpas you can't stop that


[04-Dec-18 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763

[04-Dec-18 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Takoy_Nahal only for bitcoin


[04-Dec-18 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Agreed @Takoy_Nahal. If it makes you feel any better, my guess is those who were heavy into FPGA were selling the VRSC for profit right away...to stakers no doubt

[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> Vega is not effective for GPU mining, the best option 570/580 RX


[04-Dec-18 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Most miners who are doing this at fpga scale are only interested in $, not accumulation.


[04-Dec-18 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Skillachie> Is there going to be a vote whether  to hard fork or not @John Westbrook  ? Would prefer hard fork to be resistant to FPGAs


[04-Dec-18 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Vega 64 is the most efficient GPU available, lol


[04-Dec-18 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> So now the problem to be solved is simply to continue to support and enable decentralization of hash power


[04-Dec-18 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> @John Westbrook absolutely right! For them the main goal of quick sale and getting the ambulance arrived

[dscrdvrsc] <Skillachie> Yup


[04-Dec-18 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Skillachie> Better to fork


[04-Dec-18 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @Skillachie, @miketout 's ANN in the #announcements channel is the only update


[04-Dec-18 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Skillachie> Ok. Hope the hard fork option is selected


[04-Dec-18 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> @Gloryman for 1 Vega you  can buy 4 RX 570. 1 Vega on Ethash 40 mh/s, 4 rx 570 111 mh/s. You're using very inefficient GPU


[04-Dec-18 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Takoy_Nahal what is the power efficiency?


[04-Dec-18 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Personally IMHO I'd like to see cooperation.  They are really skilled at what they do and cooperating with Verus in some sort of mutually beneficial agreement would only be a major plus to the community and the project. In many ways it would also be a boost in just technical/dev resources as well.


[04-Dec-18 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Vega 64 can hold price better as it is a high end gaming card.


[04-Dec-18 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Skillachie I agree with it option


[04-Dec-18 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> this is the current rate on one black miner f1, what gpu can compete with that?

[04-Dec-18 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> from the HashAltCoin discord (makers of F1) #mining: ```
dukeletoToday at 1:34 PM
if VRSC changed their algo, slightly, but kept HarakaV2 core, how long would it take for new private bitstreams to be created, roughly?
just looking for a rough estimate
GEBuckyToday at 1:38 PM
Less than a week if someone put their mind to it.
There are other coins to mine and new algos coming so not the end of the world. .Just very disappointing if it happens.```


[04-Dec-18 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> less than a week to update a trivial bitstream update


[04-Dec-18 02:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> that is not a problem. if we come to an agreement, they would hopefully be able to have a bitstream by activation time for the new algo, and it should then help maintain the interest of casual and even CPU mining with the current thinking by making lowering their relative advantage. if we don't make an agreement, those machines will need to be pointed at other coins, but we will likely have another similar event in the future with unknown options to solve right now. if we make an agreement, FPGA owners would really have nothing to complain about, and miners with CPUs and GPUs would be in a better position to choose Verus as a coin to mine with their hashrate. that is the goal


[04-Dec-18 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> there is no bitstream that those machines would be able get that would enable them to mine the new algorithm if we fully fork away. the problem will be a question of who's next and how much resources will we have to spend next time.


[04-Dec-18 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> with no agreement, somebody makes a private bitstream a few weeks later and then an even smaller set of miners have an advantage over the rest of the network


[04-Dec-18 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> the cost on the verus community is very high to constantly fork. I see it as a large issue, as a verus CPU miner, who has been here from almost the genblock


[04-Dec-18 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> not sure what you're saying. can you explain what you mean? the scenario makes no sense to me as I understand it


[04-Dec-18 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> Their discord seems to think an agreement is not viable, let's say that fails


[04-Dec-18 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> Verus has the only option to fork, let's call it verushash v2


[04-Dec-18 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> the new private bitstream for that will take a very short time to make, and those people will not release it in a cheap consumer-friendly fpga, most likely


[04-Dec-18 03:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the reason their discord doesn't like it now is FUD, IMO a big factor here as well, not necessarily intentional, but amplified sometimes


[04-Dec-18 03:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> how will someone make a private bitstream for an algo that can't run on those FPGAs?


[04-Dec-18 03:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> so for verus to fork, fixes the problem for a short time, and makes the problem worse, it seems. But obviously, a lot is being talked about behind closed doors


[04-Dec-18 03:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> or do you mean a new company with more expensive FPGAs?


[04-Dec-18 03:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @miketout are you planning on completely changing and not using harakav2? that will take them longer


[04-Dec-18 03:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> i am talking about people that can make new bitstreams very fast. They say 1 week if you keep haraka v2. Obviously more time if you drastically change it


[04-Dec-18 03:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> how viable is it to drastically change the PoW every X months?


[04-Dec-18 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i am not going to say how we will change it until we have an agreement, but i expect to use a Haraka core. suffice it to say, i believe we can up the bar over what they can do now or attenuate them to some degree to enable casual mining with CPUs and likely GPUs


[04-Dec-18 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it can be done, but i believe there are much better things to spend resources on if we can get an agreement that works for everyone


[04-Dec-18 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> an agreement doesn't stop other companies from doing this, or wealthy individuals


[04-Dec-18 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> seems like a rough stopgap, but maybe better than nothing


[04-Dec-18 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> an agreement would put an end to fighting hardware, and anyone who does the same will have to deal with the same technical challenge that will not be a stopgap in any case. seems like FUD to me


[04-Dec-18 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @miketout what exactly is "FUD"?


[04-Dec-18 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> fear, uncertainty and doubt


[04-Dec-18 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> i know the definition, what are you saying is FUD?


[04-Dec-18 03:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> to think that there is only a rough stop gap solution


[04-Dec-18 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> or maybe i misunderstood?


[04-Dec-18 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> It likely won't be popular opinion but is there a third option of" if you can't beat them join them" by reaching out to all fpga developers and rely on that form  of decentralization to balance them out


[04-Dec-18 03:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> As a CPU miner who was very excited to build a VRSC very power efficient CPU mining farm, all this news made me feel deep dread and stopped all my plans. As a hodler of lots of timelocked VRSC, and a miner, I hope you solve all the problems of FPGAs. But I won't believe it until I see it. The burden of proof is on Verus to show it can protect itself against FPGAs


[04-Dec-18 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> It wouldn't make the core miners happy though but it would at least provide a very strong hashrate security and re-establish some form of decentralization that Embraces what we cannot change about the future


[04-Dec-18 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BigCat45> @miketout did they give you any eta on the decision? As I understand it their farm will be back in 2 days


[04-Dec-18 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @dukeleto did you make such a farm and have a real reason to make such inflammatory statements, or just wanting to sow discord on discord? we know what we can do, and we will do what we believe is best for the whole of the Verus community, whether we prove beforehand or not


[04-Dec-18 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> @miketout Duke is not trying to make inflammatory comments. He (like me) is just of italian descent. üôÇ Very passionate, just that. And talented dev.


[04-Dec-18 03:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @miketout i have been indeed working on the farm, with guidance from jl777 who can verify that statement. It's the plain truth. Now, FPGAs seem like a much better decision to mine Verus


[04-Dec-18 03:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> and I plan to study FPGA coding, if Verus forks their PoW, I will be very incentivized to make my own bitstream

[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> In a ideal situation, this might play out different. But I'm very pleased that you already started to talk with the company & then we can move forward.


[04-Dec-18 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> no decision is yet made. we are working with the company to make sure any plan is good for the community long term


[04-Dec-18 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> decision or no decision, we trust you, @miketout 100%, this project rocks


[04-Dec-18 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> I trust Mike is doing what is best for Verus, bc if we forked, he would be doing the work on that, too.


[04-Dec-18 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> I have gone into various other discords to study what is going on. I figured a friendly voice to say what is going on, without a filter, might be helpful. I know that I don't agree with Mike 100%, but I think that is also valuable for the community, to get diverse reporting


[04-Dec-18 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> @dukeleto I'm going to have to read what you have written lol

[04-Dec-18 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dukeleto> @miketout i guess any talking we can do is best here. I don't feel like I am spreading FUD, as somebody who has contributed source code, and been a miner and has timelocked VRSC. I have to go anyway, so you don't need to worry about more "FUD"


[04-Dec-18 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs about stress or drama. It is a discussion...but to test for fud you gotta ask ‚Äúwhat is this accomplishing really?‚Äù when statements, especially ones laced in literal doubt, uncertainty and fear, continue to be the focus and pressed back into a conversation that has room for expanding into something productive


[04-Dec-18 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> I think everything was said, that needed to be. It's healthy. Unfortunately, stressful. Yeah, Duke knows that Management comment was bullshit.


[04-Dec-18 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Tommygun007> i think from a community point of view perhaps a vote is needed from what descision is to be made if any..just my two cents.


[04-Dec-18 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it's BS that isn't part of the equation because of a little thing called reality. I could just as easily say a lot about the burden of proof on many issues


[04-Dec-18 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> @miketout  You know where we a stand Mike..

[04-Dec-18 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> If he knows it‚Äôs bs he shouldn‚Äôt say it as a statement...being responsible with your statements isn‚Äôt too difficult to practice

[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> im not paying any attention to fud, i beleive in this project and i fully intend to keep being a part of it , i tend to agree with what mike has been saying and i find it interesting what others are saying but i made my mind up long ago to support verus as a crypto and nothing that i read is going to change my mind ,


[04-Dec-18 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Well it‚Äôs okay to question, no one is suggesting blind belief or support üòÉ


[04-Dec-18 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the discussion is great. i feel there are ulterior motives when it becomes a long term pattern


[04-Dec-18 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> But there‚Äôs a diff between discussing, questioning, even challenging...and stirring things up, fud, etc without a clear purpose of helping or contributing to the discussion besides perhaps alt motives

Mike you do a lot of great work from helping beginers such as myself to begin the mining process as well as working out whatever bugs may occur with the coin..so if anything just move on and keep doing what your doing don't let one persons opinion get to you.  You know you do a great job so no worries it will all be good again soon.

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I have been trying to think of what benefit someone would have spreading fud. It seems like there is none. The only thing I could come up with is fear. It only means they are heavily invested and are afraid of what might happen so they spread fud in order to get people behind them to rally on what they believe is the right course of action which of course isn't necessarily the best for a community

[04-Dec-18 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> i feel worse about them now than i did before , secretly mining and pourpesly hiding it from us , sketchy bunch, obviusly , not the fpga's fault , üòÑ  just the operators


[04-Dec-18 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i think if we get the right agreement, and especially if we can achieve the changes I'm hoping for, we will have made the transition without facing another in the near future. i believe the right agreement cannot cut out the community of miners we have now, and it cannot make the entire project dependent on any one company


[04-Dec-18 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> if we can't get the right agreement, then i feel we need to fork away and work towards our own FPGA solution


[04-Dec-18 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> maybe a pic from 30,000 feet will lighten the conversation...anyone ever seen a raincircle? (rainbow circular)

[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> @miketout Do you think you will be able to please them both?


[04-Dec-18 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> both?


[04-Dec-18 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> FPGA company and our miners


[04-Dec-18 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it's not about pleasing them both to me, so i am not thinking about pleasing as much as making it the best option forward for the community of miners in light of some upcoming transition to new hardware, and giving the company an option that makes it in their interest to support the Verus community.


[04-Dec-18 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i know that some people will not be happy either way


[04-Dec-18 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> Sorry, poor word selection


[04-Dec-18 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> not a problem and not trying to be pedantic üòÉ


[04-Dec-18 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> It does make a difference. I understand


[04-Dec-18 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> It sounds like you have every situation sort of mapped out


[04-Dec-18 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> Thanks Mike.


[04-Dec-18 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> I know this isn't something we planned for.


[04-Dec-18 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i believe a low price of entry for mining Verus with specialized hardware will be good for the community, and if we can achieve continued viability of casual mining on CPUs and GPUs, which could then be profitable with coming changes or a bull market, that would be ideal


[04-Dec-18 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i also believe if we can't find a way to resolve it by turning it into an opportunity, then it will cost us more in resources and time to the real vision. that doesn't mean we should accept something that isn't good long term for the community


[04-Dec-18 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> The community did get what, 6-7 months, of CPU & GPU, no Asics or FPGA?


[04-Dec-18 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> That means those that have been here, probably have taken advantage of this.


[04-Dec-18 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i don't think it's a burden of proof issue at all. we have made no claims to justify such a statement. i think it's a matter of looking at the reality we find ourselves in and making the best decision we can make for the future. I actually believe as @jl777c said that if we can make this transition in a positive way, it can be a major positive for Verus Coin and the Verus Project, but I don't want that opportunity to cloud my judgement into wanting to accept something unless it is good long term


[04-Dec-18 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto80> @miketout I agree with JL777, in that we (all of us) should move forward, on a positive note. So speak up, if you have an opinion on this matter. Everyones opinion in this community matters


[04-Dec-18 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> Maybe we should consult hardware specialists.


[04-Dec-18 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> I personally think that today's processors are crap. Much more than what we believe.


[04-Dec-18 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> And probably people should quit trying to mine with them. But I can't know that for sure, because I'm no hardware expert.


[04-Dec-18 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> It definitely puts stress on them, yeah


[04-Dec-18 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> This could be an opportunity for some miners

[04-Dec-18 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> In a way we are...at least in talks with hardware specialists (i.e. the hashalt guys) üòÉ


[04-Dec-18 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> that‚Äôs one of the points of reaching out to them


[04-Dec-18 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I am working with multiple people who can design FPGA code, and I feel like we have a good handle on things with people that I know won‚Äôt have conflicts or if they do I know what they are. I‚Äôm interested in talking to other real hardware experts, of course, but i do know some, and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs wise to show our full hand before an agreement.


[04-Dec-18 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> I mean, CPU is probably already dead in the water, and it's a lost cause. That would be a terrible scenario if Verus decides to keep fighting back FPGA supremacy.


[04-Dec-18 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> CPU may yet have more life than people think. No guarantee now, but with some changes I‚Äôm looking at, CPU is likely to have the biggest benefit, and possibly a big one at that. FPGA‚Äôs, if not blocked will still be fastest by some amount.


[04-Dec-18 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @miketout Really, CPU?


[04-Dec-18 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> There was no harassment, only explanation of my issues with your behavior relative to the community and truthful communication intended not to embarrass you, but inform in case you had a different perspective to explain. I welcome anyone to follow the link to see your advertised dirty laundry if they have any concerns. Personally, I prefer to take up beefs with people in private than to air in public, as I believe being honest, which doesn't always need to happen in public, is the first step towards a chance for something to improve. I have no shame for what I said trying to hash it out with you and give you a chance to respond without involving everyone in the discussion. That you choose to seek attention and share this way up to you. I consider your taking an argument to the community a negative, and I suspect I am not the only one. I will leave this post here unless people in the community would like both deleted.


[04-Dec-18 06:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> I think its childish posting the PM conversation


[04-Dec-18 06:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> Until the decision is ultimately decided, in all fairness, it's probably wise to remove references to CPU and GPU mining as it isn't viable at all (well, right now it is due to the F1s shutdown). You don't see Bitcoin listing CPU and GPU mining because it isn't practical. A 30x multiplier on top of the line CPUs/GPUs  with the F1s. By all means, altruistic miners continue mining at a loss but you are better of mining nearly anything else and exchanging to Verus than mining directly (again, shutdown aside).

Latest word on the street is the @VerusCoin mining network has been taken over by FPGA miners. 20-40X power efficiency and ~50X the hashrate of high end CPUs + GPUs, it's not looking good for CPU/GPU miners. What happens next?

[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @bishop   Hey, you're right. Now what?


[04-Dec-18 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> maybe people should go spread panic about every issue that every project has under control. it's strange to understand where you might be coming from @bishop


[04-Dec-18 06:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Let's lay it all out... What gives @bishop


[04-Dec-18 06:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> it's strange you seem so against hearing community members voicing their issue with with FPGAs on the network


[04-Dec-18 06:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> is it not a community coin?


[04-Dec-18 06:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> do none of the users have any input?


[04-Dec-18 06:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we have two options, which is more than most coins would have for good reason. i'm going to take a break for a few


[04-Dec-18 06:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @bishop Of course the users has input ...


[04-Dec-18 06:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Why go about it like this?


[04-Dec-18 06:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> This came off more as an attack


[04-Dec-18 06:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> I think you're reading way too much into it


[04-Dec-18 06:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> again, this is in reference to the tweet I saw


[04-Dec-18 06:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @bishopAnd that's it?


[04-Dec-18 06:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @bishop your argument seems intentionally naive and possibly dishonest. i'm taking a break


[04-Dec-18 06:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> oh god, so now I'm fuding, christ mike


[04-Dec-18 06:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> He just said he's taking a break


[04-Dec-18 06:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Take a breather guys


[04-Dec-18 06:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> do you not see how that tweet has no positive and is only harmful to every single person who actually has an interest in the right thing happening?


[04-Dec-18 06:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> perhaps many aren't in discord and are aware of what is going on


[04-Dec-18 06:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> come to think of it, no updates have been provided on BCT


[04-Dec-18 06:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> you seem to argue that it is defensible as something good


[04-Dec-18 06:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> letting users or potential users aware of the current situation?


[04-Dec-18 06:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @bishop Here in the announcements?


[04-Dec-18 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> not everyone is in discord


[04-Dec-18 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> He wrote a lengthy description


[04-Dec-18 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> people should be aware to know


[04-Dec-18 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> It's the only outlet for Verus


[04-Dec-18 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> BCT, the official twitter, etc?


[04-Dec-18 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> We aren't on Telegram


[04-Dec-18 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i have been working on the agreement. there is no secret about the value of mining on any device, and there is no emergency or security issue. spreading unknowns when we will know quite soon is basically spreading exactly fear, uncertainty, and doubt. how does it help?


[04-Dec-18 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> Neither have been updated to show what is going on in the community around this issue


[04-Dec-18 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> they are not even on the network right now, and may not be until we actually have a reason to be quite excited about the future. i'd get much further without people who are supposed to be devs on other coins trolling Verus and me


[04-Dec-18 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> They will be back when their hosting is back online on the 6th


[04-Dec-18 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> then you will see the nethash 25-30TH again


[04-Dec-18 06:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> Honestly, you should update both bitcointalk and your official twitter about what is going on so people or prospective users are aware


[04-Dec-18 06:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> that's all


[04-Dec-18 06:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> and we are talking to them and should be working on that, which is how we might get something good out of this for the community, not dealing with trolls trying to harm communication and decisionmaking


[04-Dec-18 06:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> discord is only one outlet


[04-Dec-18 06:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @bishop Does every project do this?


[04-Dec-18 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Write an official update about every situation they encounter? You are mad


[04-Dec-18 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> I would say this is a large enough situation to warrant in update on all forms of media


[04-Dec-18 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> What are you getting, by doing this?


[04-Dec-18 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> A potential fork and weighing options should be put out there on all forums


[04-Dec-18 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> I'm not saying every little issue needs to be uniform across media


[04-Dec-18 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> but a fork is


[04-Dec-18 06:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> What does any troll gain?


[04-Dec-18 06:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> I really hope I'm not being lumped into the troll category for voicing an opinion about keeping the community informed


[04-Dec-18 06:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> BS. it's communications 101, if you spread uncertainty, you spread FUD. we have things to say soon. nothing we say now helps anyone because they can do nothing until there are the options in front of us


[04-Dec-18 06:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> All I know that there is more behind this, than can be seen at this moment


[04-Dec-18 06:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> A small update about the situation would have been welcomed to see on both twitter and BCT


[04-Dec-18 06:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Why haven't you mentioned this before Duke did all of this?


[04-Dec-18 06:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> unfortunately, Duke already did that for you


[04-Dec-18 06:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> I didnt really see any update to be had


[04-Dec-18 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> There is no imminent fork


[04-Dec-18 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> It will have to in some shape


[04-Dec-18 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> unless it is decided that CPU and GPU miners don't matter


[04-Dec-18 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> which is fine if that is what the ultimate community decision is


[04-Dec-18 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Why haven't you mentioned this before Duke did all of this? @bishop


[04-Dec-18 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> he attempted to harm the project, nothing more, and that should be recognize, IMO, just as we recognize when people contribute.


[04-Dec-18 06:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> try 10 hours ago @Cruz


[04-Dec-18 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> Let me ask this Bishop...Is the point to profit? or a quality, usefull project?


[04-Dec-18 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> I think a major selling point to verus is CPU and GPUs being on near level playing fields


[04-Dec-18 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @bishop Really? Okay


[04-Dec-18 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> I cannot think of another coin that can say that


[04-Dec-18 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> yes. we should make an update now, but that is just more make work, courtesy of Duke that only helps calm people he may have scared into realizing he spread incomplete, sensationalized FUD, not useful information


[04-Dec-18 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> If its quality and supporting a project...cpu and gpu miners still ahve their part


[04-Dec-18 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> supporting a project by advertising or buy demand sure, but not securing pow


[04-Dec-18 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> And absolutely no coin or token is immune to rapidly advancing technology


[04-Dec-18 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> unless you have free or damn near free power


[04-Dec-18 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> I reccomend reading SIA coins blog about asics


[04-Dec-18 06:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> I'm not foolish enough to mine at a loss when  it would be better to mine XMR and trade to VRSC


[04-Dec-18 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @bishop it was true when we said it, and we're not saying that until it's true again. that does not define the project


[04-Dec-18 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> check the mining calculator and decide. right now, it's not so bad.


[04-Dec-18 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> lol, because the FPGAs are offline


[04-Dec-18 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> short-term noise


[04-Dec-18 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the FUD is short term noise


[04-Dec-18 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> FPGAs being on the network isn't FUD


[04-Dec-18 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> yes it is


[04-Dec-18 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> how


[04-Dec-18 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> it's a factual statement


[04-Dec-18 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> this moment in time, no, because they are offline


[04-Dec-18 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> but in two days, same old action


[04-Dec-18 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> enough feeding the hype train, Im out


[04-Dec-18 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> because if people understand that it will be a reality for all coins, we could instead consider it a great opportunity if we do get to move to hardware in a way everyone in the community can participate in, as well as keep CPUs and GPUs possible for casual mining. that's what we're working towards. screaming "FPGA fire!" when the community is working on serious technical decisions and cooperation that can be quite good is an attempt to harm


[04-Dec-18 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> perfect timing...rewarded with a stake


[04-Dec-18 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> @miketout I have a ton of respect for you, I genuinely wish this gets resolved sooner rather than latter, but at this time, I cannot see how the gap can possibly be closed


[04-Dec-18 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> the performance gap is just too out of reach


[04-Dec-18 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> I welcome surprises though!


[04-Dec-18 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> just because I no longer POW mine Verus doesn't mean I'm not staking. I just liked the balance of CPU/GPU miners


[04-Dec-18 06:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> if you are serious about something, shouldn't you put money and/or effort into it?


[04-Dec-18 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> @bishop 
*miketout I have a ton of respect for you, I genuinely wish this gets resolved sooner rather than latter, but at this time, I cannot see how the gap can possibly be closed
the performance gap is just too out of reach*

Wasn't the same the case just recently.
When you make a cake, you break a few eggs.  
These eggs will get cooked into the recipie somehow and the coin will survive.
Hardware advancements are inevitable.   Lookup Moore's Law.  
The best that can be done long term is to look at fundamentals (and if you think a great coin like VERUS was just started because of an algorithm or to support miners incomes, then I have news for you). 
Features and methods change.


[04-Dec-18 07:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> 100 years ago doctors gave you Cocaine and Morphine for a cold or flu.  Cars only functioned on gas.  Computers were not even a thought in anyones mind.


[04-Dec-18 07:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> Being adaptable is key.   While I do see this as a community coin, the development team will ultimately be able to determine what's going to be the best course of action.


[04-Dec-18 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> @FishyGuts ` if you think a great coin like VERUS was just started because of an algorithm or to support miners incomes, then I have news for you` no where did I say that


[04-Dec-18 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> You're right, and I did not mean to infer that to you... I was more speaking generally at that point, sorry. 

Lining miners pockets through algorithm games because of hardware advancements has never sat well with me, even as someone who started in crypto with mining, but that's just opinion.


[04-Dec-18 07:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> I've largely said my peace, if the community decides to keep the large advantage of FPGAs, then so be it, but then at the very least the references to GPU and CPU mining should go away. As I used as an example prior, you don't see Bitcoin advertising CPU or GPU mining even when both can hash SHA256 because it would be silly. Same situation would be the case here


[04-Dec-18 07:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> I don't need to beat a dead horse, I've said what I needed to say, others can contribute their thoughts as well, that's what makes a community coin great.


[04-Dec-18 07:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> Did Bitcoin take the inference of "one cpu one vote" out of their whitepaper?  I certainly don't think Verus will continue with false advertising based on the actions they take.  

This is what we call a speedbump for a great project like this.


[04-Dec-18 07:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> not referring to the whitepaper. I'm talking the website and the BCT thread


[04-Dec-18 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> Things take time to update.
The Discord ann can be transferred by a community member if you wish.  Maybe the team overlooked it, or haven't had the moment to jump over there and update it.  
As silly as that sounds, it happens.

[04-Dec-18 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> Hell, look at the Pirate Website üòÇ


[04-Dec-18 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> That's gonna be done finally in the next week or so.  I gotta say it's looking really pretty.


[04-Dec-18 08:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I think it's important to note that some of the loudest voices in this channel right now are not actually in Verus at all. While everyone's opinion can be important, it would be dangerous to allow the conversation and decision to be driven by people who have no stake in the coin at all.


[04-Dec-18 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> I must say.  The times early on I spoke with mike.  He has been very levelminded.  I‚Äôm confident the development team will find the best of solutions.  Lately these events seem quite stressful.  I‚Äôm not following too closely.  But are there trolls here?   I don‚Äôt see fgpa a big issue. Is it?   It‚Äôs been a fair launch.


[04-Dec-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I'd say the devil you know is better than the devil you don't applies in this situation as some have mentioned. Maybe the foundation should purchase one of these miners to aid in development

[dscrdvrsc] <admon> im left mining


[04-Dec-18 09:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> I just started mining with my house


[04-Dec-18 09:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> Gpus


[04-Dec-18 09:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> Was mining with cpu early on


[04-Dec-18 09:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> the reward is toooo lew


[04-Dec-18 09:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> low


[04-Dec-18 09:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> Is it?


[04-Dec-18 09:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> Seems okay


[04-Dec-18 09:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> nope


[04-Dec-18 09:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> What if Verus was worth $20


[04-Dec-18 09:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> Then would it be worth it?


[04-Dec-18 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> i dont discous that


[04-Dec-18 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763

[04-Dec-18 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> i have many gpus and its no profitable mining thats all


[04-Dec-18 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> How many you got?


[04-Dec-18 09:32 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <admon> yes that i do it


[04-Dec-18 09:32 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> lol


[04-Dec-18 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ph03nix> sarcasm aside, tech is always advancing


[04-Dec-18 11:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ph03nix> embrace it


[04-Dec-18 11:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> @@miketout Which is the issue FPGA are causing, other than reduced (or none) profit for hobbyst? When you release something in the wild, you can't keep fighting for every thing doesn't align with the vision or you will get overwhelmed. I can understand the "decentralization vision" but, forcing someone to stop a behaviour isn't and probably Verus will be attacked for this. Assuming everybody in the world has the same hardware and can only mine the same amount, what if tomorrow arise a much more profitable coin and all miners switch to it? Imho, the mining should be considered a simple transport protocol (you can run a tor node or a wifi hotspot in your house for your pleasure but you are not paid for it) it cannot be "The big thing" or the core of a project. It may be a too ahead of times vision but totally aligned with today IT paradigms


[04-Dec-18 11:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I still haven't seen a good argument from the doomsayers why people can't just buy the FPGA and continue on


[04-Dec-18 11:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I could understand that argument *before* the tech and supplier were known, but now they are


[04-Dec-18 11:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> From my admittedly very limited understanding the fpgas seem superior in every way to GPUs, and even ASICs so why so desperately cling onto some nostalgia tech?


[04-Dec-18 11:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Patrick ManBearPig some people dont have 2.5k. And, it limits growth of VRSC to FPGA miners and traders, less casual people.


[04-Dec-18 11:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Where do you draw that line then? Some people don't have $400 for a GPU, or even $1 for a GPU. There will always be someone who can afford bigger and better than you


[04-Dec-18 11:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crabby Paddy> Tbh that‚Äôs like saying they should make it so people can only single gpu mine and it‚Äôs unfair people buy 100s of gpus


[04-Dec-18 11:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crabby Paddy> Miners will mine either way


[04-Dec-18 11:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Find 4 other people and split it 5 ways


[04-Dec-18 11:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crabby Paddy> Whether fpga or not, they‚Äôll just buy 10000 cups or gpus same end game. I don‚Äôt mine with fpga, but it‚Äôs not that much of a negative imo


[04-Dec-18 11:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> @Patrick ManBearPig it may sound rude, but imho crypto has given the illusion that everybody can make money; in any other industrial sector, a thing more energy efficient (and, thus, with less operational costs) is considered a God's gift, here is an Evil sneaky idea. I never seen someone scream at AMD, just example, because their new cpu is more powerful with less watts üòÉ 

@Gloryman Some (almost all tbh) people don't have the billions needed to run a datacenter, but everybody turn on VMs using Google, Azure, etc.... What's the point? Blockchain, as well as any other tech, is an enabler for something else; as long as it is considered the end point instead of the starting point, it is useless. Imho, of course


[04-Dec-18 11:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Patrick ManBearPig $400 GPU doesnt stop someone with a laptop at home making money off their terrible cpu


[04-Dec-18 11:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> fpgas do


[05-Dec-18 12:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Shouldn't something be done to stop people with a dozen threadrippers so it's more fair for the guy with the single celeron then?


[05-Dec-18 12:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> "It's not fair" is not a good argument


[05-Dec-18 12:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> buying more threadrippers is less efficient than buying gpus


[05-Dec-18 12:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Buying more gpus is less efficient than buying the fpga


[05-Dec-18 12:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> so we are right back at my original statement of not seeing a good argument why someone can't buy the fpga. "I can't afford it" doesn't cut it


[05-Dec-18 12:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> If you were talking about something that costs hundreds of thousands maybe


[05-Dec-18 12:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I've already explained to you the argument of distribution and limiting growth. If you cant understand these concepts, just leave it at that.


[05-Dec-18 12:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> But you're talking about essentially the same amount of capital outlay as building a gpu rig


[05-Dec-18 12:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> @Gloryman  your 400$ in gpus will give a child the opportunity to survive for an year, in a third world country. Isn't more "profitable" give him a chance to live and learn, instead of gaining 2.5$ / day with mining?


[05-Dec-18 12:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> As for so called hobbyists, something called a field programmable gate array sounds a lot more interesting from a hobby standpoint than a gpu


[05-Dec-18 12:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> You guys are too smart for me, I can't argue with you. bye now


[05-Dec-18 12:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rhaz01> In a perfect world average basement nerd would use the gaming rig momma bought to mine for a perfect decentralization


[05-Dec-18 12:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rhaz01> momma does not buy fpgas


[05-Dec-18 12:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Basement nerd can get a job and buy one


[05-Dec-18 12:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Get a job and buy a yacht!


[05-Dec-18 12:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rhaz01> i know guys who would mine at night or while they did not game. Guess what, none bought fpgas


[05-Dec-18 12:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> And gamers have been screaming about miners driving up the prices and hogging all the gpus


[05-Dec-18 12:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> This is what VRSC community and descended into. We sound like a shitcoin fourm


[05-Dec-18 12:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Again "I can't afford it" is not an argument. I can't afford a lot of things


[05-Dec-18 12:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Patrick ManBearPig ok rich boy. you are very rich. congrats, lol


[05-Dec-18 12:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> I have a 3d printer @ home but I'm not upset for the companies that run 3d printing services at 1/100 of mine costs. It is called hobby, I'm fine to print a cute teddybear for 25$ when, in China, the same is printed for 0.025$ and maybe even sold!! Now that business mining has entered VRSC, as usual, tons of people are screaming because of they lost their 1$ daily profit


[05-Dec-18 12:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Rich? Everything I own fits in 2 bags


[05-Dec-18 12:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I'm so rich I bought a painting.


[05-Dec-18 12:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rhaz01> Actually it is, "i can't afford it" is the reason for most things in the world.


[05-Dec-18 12:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> A painting is NOT an argument. Its an art form


[05-Dec-18 12:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ph03nix> @Gloryman you are new to crypto, yes?


[05-Dec-18 12:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I'm so rich I am eating beans and rice out of a slow cooker, in a studio apartment in a small city in China.


[05-Dec-18 12:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rhaz01> Imagine your government said, there will be no public transportation, " I can"t afford an helicopter" is not an argument  üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ


[05-Dec-18 12:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ph03nix> i am not a miner, but i've heard this argument over and over


[05-Dec-18 12:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Imagine comparing buying GPUs to public transit


[05-Dec-18 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ph03nix> deal with it, equipment gets obsoleted very quickly


[05-Dec-18 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> It's more like demanding no one sells DVD players because I  only want to use a VCR


[05-Dec-18 12:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I can't afford a Blu-ray, do something


[05-Dec-18 12:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rhaz01> The point is to use what most people have. Not to be anti something.  ATM fpgas are like phoenixes and only in the hands of the few.


[05-Dec-18 12:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Right now you can go buy one which will mine Verus. It's $2500


[05-Dec-18 12:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Not 25,000. Not 2.5 million. $2500


[05-Dec-18 12:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @ph03nix are you new to paintings? Paintings are NOT arguments. They are works of art.  @Patrick ManBearPig I know you have beans lined with gold and linen bags of goods, STOP bragging.


[05-Dec-18 12:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Could we get a quick survey on how much people spend on mining rigs?


[05-Dec-18 12:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Patrick ManBearPig 2500 is higher than 25,000 if you think about it.


[05-Dec-18 12:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I was selling GPUs on Amazon for over a grand each earlier this year


[05-Dec-18 12:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ph03nix> asics/fpgas will exist whether you like it or not


[05-Dec-18 12:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Patrick ManBearPig why not 2 grand. Are you good at business?


[05-Dec-18 12:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @ph03nix NO, FPGAs are already here!


[05-Dec-18 12:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rhaz01> Asics/ fpgas are perfectly fine for a mature project, not for one in infancy who needs to build a community of followers first


[05-Dec-18 12:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Ok, that at least has some reasoning behind it


[05-Dec-18 12:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ph03nix> @Gloryman i know


[05-Dec-18 12:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @ph03nix I dont think you do. They DO exist!


[05-Dec-18 12:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> You build a community with mining? Based only on mining, which is the key difference of VRSC?


[05-Dec-18 12:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ph03nix> i thought that's what we were discussing


[05-Dec-18 12:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Ultimately though, whether someone spends more than you on cpus or gpus they are getting more coins.


[05-Dec-18 12:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rhaz01> Look up on discords of new projects, what do you see? almost all of them are miners


[05-Dec-18 12:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I can't stake as much as the guys at the top of the richlist, who is going to do something to even that out?


[05-Dec-18 12:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ph03nix> gloryman


[05-Dec-18 12:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> He did sell me some cheap Verus yesterday


[05-Dec-18 12:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> so what the anti-FPGA is saying is that FPGA will kill Verus project?


[05-Dec-18 12:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig>  .


[05-Dec-18 12:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rhaz01> Nobody is saying that, I just say  Verus would do better with a larger community


[05-Dec-18 12:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> so you are saying with FPGA , Verus won't have a larger community?


[05-Dec-18 12:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ph03nix> this fpga talk will make a larger community


[05-Dec-18 12:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rhaz01> I'm not even a miner at this point so I got no interest at what devices are used. I only stake so I think I can give my unbiased 2 cents


[05-Dec-18 12:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I only stake as well. And do some market making on the exchange


[05-Dec-18 12:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rhaz01> Verus community was built around CPU miners


[05-Dec-18 12:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rhaz01> FPGA miners are only a few


[05-Dec-18 12:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> yes, much like how BTC started


[05-Dec-18 12:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rhaz01> When you got just one option, you stick with it.


[05-Dec-18 12:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ph03nix> adapt


[05-Dec-18 12:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rhaz01> and afapt ofc


[05-Dec-18 12:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rhaz01> but there is still plenty opportunities now for cpu/ gpu miners that pay just as well as verus did on cpu/gpu


[05-Dec-18 12:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rhaz01> so instead of adapting you can just move now


[05-Dec-18 12:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ph03nix> correct


[05-Dec-18 12:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> yes, until the price becomes profitable again and move back


[05-Dec-18 12:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> or if FPGA price comes down to match the price of GPU maybe?


[05-Dec-18 12:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rhaz01> That would definitely be something


[05-Dec-18 12:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Aren't the FPGAs less expensive dollar for dollar though?


[05-Dec-18 12:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> yeah, dollar for dollar is definitely cheaper


[05-Dec-18 12:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rhaz01> performance / hash yes


[05-Dec-18 12:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rhaz01> But when I started mining as a hobby I started with a 200usd gpu


[05-Dec-18 12:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rhaz01> do you think I would have bought a 2.5k device from the get go?


[05-Dec-18 12:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rhaz01> neah


[05-Dec-18 12:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ph03nix> timing


[05-Dec-18 12:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> Why the VRSC price has to affected? Assuming fpga is around 600w/h and they have 0,10$/kw, fgpa costs are around 250$ / month (miner + hosting).  I really don't see this incredible uber profit and subsequent dumping


[05-Dec-18 12:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> @Diabolik  I don't either. According to some posts in their discord the current profit is about $10 a day


[05-Dec-18 12:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> the invisible hand will move the price to match supply and demand üòÑ


[05-Dec-18 12:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> sooo, 250$ costs and 300$ revenues....wooow, this is going to destroy Verus üòõ


[05-Dec-18 12:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rhaz01> Is not about profits, its about rewards imo. How you centralize the rich list


[05-Dec-18 12:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> rich list with 50$ / month?


[05-Dec-18 12:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Yeah, I think it is a huge overreaction, but somewhat understandable based upon how it was uncovered and some of the behaviors of the miners


[05-Dec-18 12:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rhaz01> what would you rather have 1000 gpu miners OR 50 fpga miners supporting the network?

[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> if they are centralized around 3 - 4 pools , it doesn't really matter, does it? As far as miners , there are only 4 big miners which are the pools, so it is not so decentralized after all?

[05-Dec-18 12:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @ph03nix You should NEVER mine something that isnt profitable

Watching the daily profit of my Dayun ZigZ1+ fall is a much worse feeling than Algo1 failling. The F1 has 9 coins that generate over $5 per day (out of 21 profitable coins) and we know a new one is coming in the next few weeks.

[05-Dec-18 12:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> It will take a long time for these guys to make it on the richlist


[05-Dec-18 12:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> @Gloryman WRONG üòÉ If you truly believe in the vision you may decide to support it without profit; at least, this is what I'm doing @ a cost


[05-Dec-18 12:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ph03nix> yes


[05-Dec-18 12:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @ph03nix @Diabolik You should ALWAYS mine something that isn't profitable.


[05-Dec-18 12:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> Do guys like me if today it is not profitable to mine Verus, get another coin, sell that coin and buy Verus. In general, invest in POS, it is now profitable


[05-Dec-18 12:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> well, whatever decision miketout makes, I will still hold my coin and run staking because i believe in the vision. And i will buy more if there is dumping in the market üòÑ


[05-Dec-18 12:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ph03nix> use common sense


[05-Dec-18 12:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @ph03nix Use expert sense!


[05-Dec-18 12:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ph03nix> @Gloryman you are the expert?


[05-Dec-18 12:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> This is the only POS coin I have come across(and thank you to the guy who gave me the tipoff) where I could actually make a decent stake


[05-Dec-18 12:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @ph03nix you are the common?


[05-Dec-18 12:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ph03nix> meh, i'm done


[05-Dec-18 12:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> If it is not profitable to mine Verus mine another coin and buy Verus on it.


[05-Dec-18 12:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> Gloryman, don't get upset. We just have a different vision and a very different skin in the game. You leaved VRSC by selling you 500 coins; I'm mining it since 23 May, if I remember well and now staking ; never ever sold 1 VRSC and believe or not, I don't have 500 vrsc only üòÉ


[05-Dec-18 12:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Diabolik> peace & love


[05-Dec-18 12:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Takoy_Nahal still doesnt solve the growth issue, buddy. But, yeah alot of people are doing that I heard.


[05-Dec-18 12:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I had to sell some profits recently. I would rather be doubling my stack


[05-Dec-18 12:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Diabolik I'm not upset. I'm just trolling people that i think are trolling me


[05-Dec-18 12:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I admit I was trolling with my comment about you selling me some cheap verus


[05-Dec-18 12:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I actually really wish I had some btc to spread around and keep taking advantage of these massive swings


[05-Dec-18 12:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> all my coin is in bitcoin now


[05-Dec-18 12:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> But I also don't want to stop staking to move coins to the exchange


[05-Dec-18 12:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> A year ago so was mine. Now it's all shitcoins and ethereum. Oh what happened. Oh well


[05-Dec-18 12:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I do have to wonder why you are still trying to hard to steer the conversation on this issue when you have already sold out your stake


[05-Dec-18 12:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Just been talking in the community for months and I can buy into it again if the issue is sorted out


[05-Dec-18 12:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ph03nix> LOL

[05-Dec-18 01:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ph03nix> goes against your recent narrative though


[05-Dec-18 01:02 AM] Gateway#3763

[05-Dec-18 01:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @ph03nix What narrative and how?


[05-Dec-18 01:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Yeah I saw that post


[05-Dec-18 01:03 AM] Gateway#3763

[05-Dec-18 01:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Let us not let this Discord devolve any further. We have most of the information we are going to get. At the end of the day it is an investment. Use the information you have in hand to make informed decisions and blame no one but yourselves. This is something I have to remind myself at times when emotions can come into things


[05-Dec-18 01:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Sorry that reads harsher than I meant for it to sound. What I meant was if I make an investment based on the information that I have and it doesn't work out I can only blame myself really there is no one else we should be placing blame on here. I can see how it can be a shame but this is how things go and is the natural march of progress


[05-Dec-18 01:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ph03nix> yes


[05-Dec-18 01:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> But at the end of the day these are all Investments. It doesn't matter how you look at it, from a money perspective or from an altruistic perspective investing in the future.


[05-Dec-18 01:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I hate to see us arguing over the same things and getting nowhere


[05-Dec-18 04:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> @ph03nix Your words about the new equipment would be fair if FPGA were sold in all stores at an affordable price. Otherwise, the situation will develop when most of the coins will be in the hands of a narrow circle of people.
Instead of thousands of holders and new members of the community, we will see a dozen wealthy whales in whose hands most of the coins are interested in not long Hodl but in a quick sale. The conversation is not about technology but about promoting the project to the masses


[05-Dec-18 04:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> Verus is not for the chosen, but for all


[05-Dec-18 04:06 AM] Gateway#3763

[05-Dec-18 04:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ph03nix> i'm a small fish, not a miner, and not emotional


[05-Dec-18 04:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> I am sure that Mike will solve this problem, so we all need to calm down and buy more Verus - the price is still low


[05-Dec-18 04:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> If you have no money and it is not profitable to mine Verus, mine another coin, sell it and buy Verus


[05-Dec-18 04:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ted> this situation won't last long


[05-Dec-18 04:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ph03nix> nope


[05-Dec-18 04:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> As far as I know there are coins that have a solution to protect against FPGA. Cryptonight heavy


[05-Dec-18 04:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ph03nix> to paraphrase jl777, it is an honor to be targeted


[05-Dec-18 04:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> What about confronting them head-on and embracing them? I read in their Discord that at our maximum hashrate our coin is no longer the most profitable to mine. So wouldn't it make the most sense to put out an article examining the new fpga phenomena? Perhaps post in the affected algorithms Discord the link to the miner as well. If enough people have the hardware the coin becomes more decentralized and it becomes less appealing to mine verus


[05-Dec-18 04:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> We aren't going to stop this so we might as well take the narrative and blow up their spot


[05-Dec-18 04:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> They will move on when it becomes no longer profitable. Right now the most important thing and what we should be focusing on is adoption


[05-Dec-18 05:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> @Godballz you are the man üëçüèº


[05-Dec-18 05:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Well said


[05-Dec-18 05:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @stretcher83 thanks man, means alot from a fellow Verus og. We will get through this and be stronger from it


[05-Dec-18 05:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I agree bud , strength in numbers , i hate to see mike taking so much of the negativity on his shoulders , hes a good person that deserves better


[05-Dec-18 05:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <basti> @Godballz similar opinion. Being so open about it can attract new miners and investors. After the news the price is relatively stable and shows the strength of the community. Pushing panic is unnecessary!


[05-Dec-18 05:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Our friends over on ginasismining pool are having a hard time today , i wish them all the best in getting there issues solved


[05-Dec-18 05:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> What issues?


[05-Dec-18 05:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> The pool has been getting attacked


[05-Dec-18 05:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> They are working hard to thwart it


[05-Dec-18 05:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @basti  @stretcher83 it's nice to start discussing proactive solutions together with each other rather than bickering and running over the same old ideas beating a dead horse


[05-Dec-18 05:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I wonder who or why someone would do that especially to them they seem like pretty stand-up people


[05-Dec-18 05:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I hope they get it under control and it doesn't cause many problems


[05-Dec-18 05:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Yeh i agree, they are a good bunch over on ginasismining


[05-Dec-18 05:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> We are all a good bunch involved in verus ,


[05-Dec-18 05:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I like to think so too. I have learned a lot here and met some great people. I think that's why it is sort of a shame to see us devolve into a mindless bickering mob. I know there is much more to this community and I am confident that we will come together and overcome this little speed bump along the way


[05-Dec-18 05:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Godballz I feel the same. Sometimes, I'm guilty of it. But when the trolls come out, it brings out my troll. After the FPGA issue is sorted i think this will all settle down buddy.


[05-Dec-18 05:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That's the spirit! Today is already off to a better start


[05-Dec-18 08:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CraigWright> Ok, let's fork this shit. Let's do "Verus TV" (Toutogni Vision), and problem solved.

[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> i am the true Toutogni.


[05-Dec-18 08:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> Joking, this is the best project in crypto-space. We're lucky to be here and to presence History. 
Look at Komodo, it wasn't perfect the first year. You learn from mistakes, problems, etc., things evolve. 
If everyone helps from their position, we'll get there, top 10 on cmc., because tech here is real.


[05-Dec-18 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> @Emmanuel "If everyone helps" Sadly there seems to be people who want to do the opposite


[05-Dec-18 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> From a dev perspective, there's nothing worse than stress. Just observe, and if you don't like the outcome wait more, or invest elsewhere. Let things flow naturally. Stressing people or pushing ideas on others is never good for software development.


[05-Dec-18 09:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <PTYX> I don't think Mike needs to answer to anyone to be honest. He's been busting his ass on this project.


[05-Dec-18 09:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <PTYX> As for the troll, definitely don't engage. It's just a waste of energy.


[05-Dec-18 09:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> "I am having trouble understanding how coin devs could be unhappy about people mining their coin. First it can only increase interest and second you either have an open system or you Obelisk the thing. Doesn‚Äôt the hash storm level out? Pirate coin can be mined with ASICs and I haven‚Äôt heard anyone upset over there about that on the Pirate discord. And there are 1 Msol people over there."

[05-Dec-18 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> There are some shady people in that group though. Very dark.


[05-Dec-18 10:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Morning everyone! Thanks for having a positive discussion for me to see first thing üòÉ we really do have an awesome community! Today, I‚Äôll be mostly MIA and working on the new algorithm. Are pools looking good now? In case anyone wonders why there was a pool attack, it was done by someone who was knocking out all the other pools besides the one they were mining on. We don‚Äôt know exactly who they are, but we have some identifying information. Last I heard the latest fix kept pools up but they were still slowed by DDoS. @Ginasis Mining Pools was looking at a fix that would make that a non-issue as well.


[05-Dec-18 10:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SadykovT> Can do mining only from Agama ?


[05-Dec-18 10:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Im mining on ginasismining


[05-Dec-18 10:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> You have to produce your public ip address with them so they can allow you to mine üëçüèº


[05-Dec-18 10:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Not a big deal for us , worth the extra security in my books


[05-Dec-18 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <basti> Hope the new algorithm is cpu solo mining:smiley_abused:


[05-Dec-18 10:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @SadykovT yes, but still slower than the other miners. I will try to change that in the next update, but it all depends on what we can do on the algo today üòÉ

[05-Dec-18 11:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> Personally, I have a very big optimism about Verus. I see a lot of potential and I see how Mike is close to the community.


[05-Dec-18 11:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> Verus is only at the very beginning of its formation, it is still a very young project. As soon as the broad mass of people learn about Verus and it will be listed on large exchanges ... Those who have not sold their coins and have been a consistent holder of coins Verus will receive a very good reward for believing in the project and patience


[05-Dec-18 11:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> In every discord of every coin there is a dude like Takoy. "Hold and you will be rewarded", but like the enthusiasm


[05-Dec-18 11:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> I am not one of those dudes who is in every discord. In my opinion there are several projects that have great potential, Verus is one of them. This is not enthusiasm or blind faith.


[05-Dec-18 11:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> I‚Äôm the one in every discord

[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> And Verus is still the one


[05-Dec-18 11:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> AkiraX knows a lot about good projects)


[05-Dec-18 11:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> I said "like you". Every community of a coin wants it to succeed or pump or whatever


[05-Dec-18 11:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> There is nothing reprehensible in this; everyone wants to make money. BUT I do not see the Verus project as an investment that I will sell at the first pump, I will still leave part of the deposit and, with a new round of the market, will again increase the Verus coins. In short, I like the project and I will be there for a long time.


[05-Dec-18 12:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Yeah it will increase in value, like every other coin üëåüèª


[05-Dec-18 12:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> Well, if so, why did you choose Verus?


[05-Dec-18 12:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Well out of all the other projects it seemed it would pump the most


[05-Dec-18 12:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> If Verus did not meet your expectations of a big pump, does this project become the same as others?


[05-Dec-18 12:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> To be honest, yes. But other mentality, other preferences, etc.


[05-Dec-18 12:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Yii> Maybe someday if we can actually do something with the coins rather than mining and trading and speculation (in general) im gonna think differently. But for now, mostly every coin has a wallet, algo and promises this and that


[05-Dec-18 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> Hash no joke 43th


[05-Dec-18 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> @Yii Many projects promise, but few really do and really communicate with the community, listen to the opinion of the community.


[05-Dec-18 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Pools getting DDOS'd... 
I guess when people don't get their way, they attack you in every way


[05-Dec-18 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Emmanuel  Hahaha... VerusTV


[05-Dec-18 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Skillachie> 28 TH/s . CPU dead with these FPGAs on the network, Hope a decision is made soon


[05-Dec-18 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Skillachie You use CPU?


[05-Dec-18 10:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Post> Is 2 months for listing on Cryptopia normal? seems like i little bit of a rip off to demand payment and than they can add you whenever they like ü§î


[05-Dec-18 10:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cryptonoobie> I heard that sort of experience in too many discords.  üò¶  CT loves to do that.


[05-Dec-18 11:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Cryptopia drags their feet, at everything...
Earlier this year, I had 4 or 5 NEO, then $40+ that I sent from Binance to Cryptopia. After I sent it, CT took down their NEO wallet due to maintenance. Long story short, I didn't see those coins, for 5+ weeks... It took Binance & other exchanges, only a few hours to fix their NEO wallet, bc of network issue...
But I think Verus will do well, on their platform...
They have good trading volume


[05-Dec-18 11:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Post> The only thing i hear from coins which lists on cryptopia, is that their wallet is mainly in maintenance for weeks üòÑ


[06-Dec-18 04:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I find it very amusing, that someone here arguing so vehemently about FPGA being let on the network, was in their Discord praising them---for their hardware's performance... Hypocricy lol


[06-Dec-18 04:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lumbi> Has anyone done the math on how much attacking power would have to be mounted to 51% VRSC's PoS/PoW hybrid? It would be a cool factoid to know. üôÉ


[06-Dec-18 04:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Fpgas are good at securing the network and they are good for the environment. I want to own an fpga. But i think they are bad for the continual growth of the vrsc community and bad because all the hash could soon be controlled by one companies bitstream. This also creates a very unstable hash rate. The white paper also states fair distribution as one of its key goals. So, at this stage of the project I think they should be banned and the currency forked. They are potentially stopping hundreds of thousands of casual miners and vrsc uses, to give close to 100% of pow coins to a few thousand fpga miner if they don't stop it.


[06-Dec-18 04:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Cruz above, no hypocrisy, I have given the same view on both discord channels


[06-Dec-18 04:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Gloryman  Man, come on...
In one sentence, you said don't negotiate with terrorists.. And then the next, you're saying that you will eventually be using an FPGA and possibly bringing Verus price down...
You can't jump from one side to the other, comment after comment...


[06-Dec-18 04:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Lumbi @Gloryman He says these negative things about FPGAs. But he has openly stated that he wants to buy one, to mine Verus with...


[06-Dec-18 05:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Don't negotiate with terrorists was a joke. But the point I was true. I believe at this point is should be forked. Also, people on the other discord channel were voicing concerns of coin raping being bad for both communities. I have always been upfront about buying an FPGA to mine with. Ask Chris and Strecher83. We have been talking about it for months. When has my opinion ever been different from any of the discords


[06-Dec-18 05:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Its always remained the same.


[06-Dec-18 05:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Cruz above


[06-Dec-18 05:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Yeah, I will mine VRSC with an FPGA if its not forked.


[06-Dec-18 05:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Then why not take a position, and keep it..
It seems like you are on both sides of the fence, so to say...


[06-Dec-18 05:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> It will damage the coin, imo, but it will create huge short term profit. It wouldnt be my fault if developer didnt want to fork it.


[06-Dec-18 05:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I have a position and I have always kept it


[06-Dec-18 05:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> You're standing in the middle, with one foot on each side


[06-Dec-18 05:03 AM] actionslacks#4072
the exact same argument has been and will be made after every advance in mining tech. fpga's were on the scene before asics many years ago.  It could be possible that asics will be created in the future to usurp the current fpga's or even the code to obsolete them. This is a microcosm of the march of progress in semiconductor design. there is no easy answer. but embracing and utilizing progress has more often than not been conducive to survival.


[06-Dec-18 05:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <plazma> Just used verus sapling shielded address to sapling shielded address....not instanious....took a sec....but fast and cool....üòç


[06-Dec-18 05:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> No bro. I will state it as simply as I can. VRSC coin should fork as i believe to be the best for the project but if they dont I will want to mine with an FPGA.


[06-Dec-18 05:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Just support the project & do, as you please... 
You seemed to put a lot of opinion out there, on this...


[06-Dec-18 05:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I got the feeling you were against FPGA...
Then I read before and after, then saw you on another discord... And I couldn't really tell what you though, except that you thought a lot


[06-Dec-18 05:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Let me put it another way. Lets say I believe that fuel prices should be taxed to raise money for something else, military for example. If they dont tax the fuel, that doesnt mean I wont take advantage of the low fuel prices. Can you see what I mean?


[06-Dec-18 05:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Cruz Sorry. I will try to be clearer in future. People that know me on this discord know I am for FPGAs but not on this coin so early


[06-Dec-18 05:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> or at least without some reducing of performance, but mainly forking


[06-Dec-18 05:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Just a quick piece of honest advice...
Write in plain English...
You are saying, FPGA might or might not be taxed on Verus mining.. Either way, you want to reap the benefits, from FPGA mining...


[06-Dec-18 05:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> And that's fair


[06-Dec-18 05:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> It was an analogy to do with wanting a rule or law to be in place but taking advantage of the law if it comes into effect.


[06-Dec-18 05:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> FPGAs are never going to be fair, imo.


[06-Dec-18 05:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> So, to sum this up---you like the Verus project...
But you also enjoy financial gain, wherever that might be.. Is that right?


[06-Dec-18 05:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I like Verus project sure and yes, I am a miner that wants value.


[06-Dec-18 05:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> The issue is not simply for or against FPGAs. There are things such as timing, pacing, competitiveness, ect...


[06-Dec-18 05:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> In my opinion, there hasn't been an honest & clear discussion, about FPGAs. And what Verus is going to be giving up, in order to get -- from this company...


[06-Dec-18 05:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Cruz agreed. That's why I tried starting the conversation buddy..


[06-Dec-18 05:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I do trust Mike wholeheartedly though..


[06-Dec-18 05:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> He has put in more work, than anyone, on this project


[06-Dec-18 05:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I don't blindly trust anyone.


[06-Dec-18 05:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> but mike is very helpful and communicative


[06-Dec-18 05:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I believe that it is in his interest, to do what is best for Verus...


[06-Dec-18 05:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> And, from his experience, it shows that he does have a skillet needed to do this


[06-Dec-18 05:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> He has real world experience in an executive role, at some of the top tech companies in the world


[06-Dec-18 05:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Well I go on my on decisions and opinions but people should do what they believe to be right


[06-Dec-18 05:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> People in executive tech roles fail all the time.


[06-Dec-18 05:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Take Hawaei


[06-Dec-18 05:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Right is right and wrong is wrong..
But I trust a guy, with that type of experience, probably over any crypto dev out ther


[06-Dec-18 05:15 AM] actionslacks#4072
It is looking like fpga mining will eclipse most asics very soon because of adaptability and efficiency. just because you fork verus to thwart current fpga's doesn't  mean the threat is gone


[06-Dec-18 05:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Fail? Dude...


[06-Dec-18 05:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Steve Balmer


[06-Dec-18 05:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> You obviously havent looked up his experience


[06-Dec-18 05:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> That's obvious


[06-Dec-18 05:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I have he developed java and was the vice president at Microsoft.


[06-Dec-18 05:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Very important operations


[06-Dec-18 05:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> And?


[06-Dec-18 05:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> and what?


[06-Dec-18 05:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> CTO of Parallels ...


[06-Dec-18 05:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Steve Balmer was the CEO of mircosoft


[06-Dec-18 05:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> voted the worst CEO ever, lol


[06-Dec-18 05:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Do you even know what he did at Microsoft?
The guy was a tech fellow


[06-Dec-18 05:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> of worst of the year


[06-Dec-18 05:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> You have no idea what you are talking about, period


[06-Dec-18 05:17 AM] actionslacks#4072
how much time do you want the project tp spend worried about keeping fpga's away?


[06-Dec-18 05:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> yeah he was in charge of the java project


[06-Dec-18 05:17 AM] actionslacks#4072
because they are not going away


[06-Dec-18 05:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Yeah and creating the .Net platform....cough cough...
That's all


[06-Dec-18 05:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> No big deal


[06-Dec-18 05:18 AM] actionslacks#4072
balmer curve


[06-Dec-18 05:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I'm not sure where this conversation is going. He has an impressive CV. I;m not arguing with that.


[06-Dec-18 05:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> He's not Steve Balmer... lol
Seriously, do your research first man


[06-Dec-18 05:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> So he probably has the ability to come up with the best plan possible


[06-Dec-18 05:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> OK mike is god. Lets all give him everything we own, you win.


[06-Dec-18 05:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> And alternatives...
But i think it should be a public discussion


[06-Dec-18 05:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> bye bro. i gtg


[06-Dec-18 05:19 AM] actionslacks#4072
sell your rig, use the fund to vrsc while its cheap. and stake it?


[06-Dec-18 05:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> You are right...


[06-Dec-18 05:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I never said Mike was God..
I said we are in a good position, with a skilled dev that also has other skills relative to this situation.


[06-Dec-18 05:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> @Cruz The funny part is that people on the fpga discord are saying the same thing about this behavior.


[06-Dec-18 05:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> What's that?


[06-Dec-18 05:21 AM] actionslacks#4072
maybe just stop fighting change. because change will never stop. adaptability is a survival mechanism.


[06-Dec-18 05:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> About playing both sides of the field


[06-Dec-18 05:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Guy sold his small stake as fast as he could, but is still here fudding up the channel


[06-Dec-18 05:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Yeah well, what's your take on all of this?


[06-Dec-18 05:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Why?


[06-Dec-18 05:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Patrick ManBearPig  For or against, FPGA?


[06-Dec-18 05:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I don't know enough to have an informed opinion really. I haven't seen a convincing argument to convince me they are bad.


[06-Dec-18 05:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Patrick ManBearPig Are you a miner?


[06-Dec-18 05:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I am not


[06-Dec-18 05:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I stake


[06-Dec-18 05:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Patrick ManBearPig   Are you interested in FPGA's?


[06-Dec-18 05:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I would like to learn more about them yeah


[06-Dec-18 05:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Me, I am not a miner.
And no, I'm not interested in buying one.
I am worried about what they could do, to many projects, and what the alternative is to counteract them


[06-Dec-18 05:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> there is open CL now for most fpga


[06-Dec-18 05:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> open CL is used for GPU coding


[06-Dec-18 05:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> fpga is the new GPU


[06-Dec-18 05:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> To me, from what I've taken from other projects is that--no, they won't be able to stop them. And they seem to basically accept them


[06-Dec-18 05:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> adaptable as GPU, fast as ASIC


[06-Dec-18 05:26 AM] actionslacks#4072
look up what fpga stands for please


[06-Dec-18 05:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> now it isnt impossible to be fpga resistant, at least for a while. but it would be quite incredibly difficult to achieve


[06-Dec-18 05:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Hey @jl777c , nice to see you here. I have a technical question. Can Komodo and VRSC survive without bitcoin?


[06-Dec-18 05:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> so even if it isnt achieved, we need to know that VRSC goes on


[06-Dec-18 05:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> bitcoin is not required


[06-Dec-18 05:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @jl777c  But they vary, from a few thousand dollars to 50k or 60k... What I am worried about is, what kind of influence over a coin would an investment like $50k get someone...


[06-Dec-18 05:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Cruz the blackminer F1s on VRSC are 2.5k


[06-Dec-18 05:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> even if someone could capture 100% of all PoW mining, that is 12 VRSC per block


[06-Dec-18 05:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> so that is as much influence as somebody who is buying 17k VRSC per day


[06-Dec-18 05:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @jl777c I think it goes against the white paper of a fairly distributed coin in my opinion.


[06-Dec-18 05:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @jl777c It would be difficult to achieve. But couldn't something like the Verus Foundation, do something financially to counteract their impact?


[06-Dec-18 05:29 AM] actionslacks#4072
we are about to find out. fpga usage is exploding


[06-Dec-18 05:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @jl777c  With KMD, what would you do?


[06-Dec-18 05:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> the whitepaper says ASIC are something that will happen


[06-Dec-18 05:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Cruz mike said forking is an option and something I agree with


[06-Dec-18 05:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> fpga is basically a programmable ASIC


[06-Dec-18 05:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> @Cruz what would I do about what?


[06-Dec-18 05:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> yes but mike said it wasnt fair and is trying to do something about it


[06-Dec-18 05:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Komodo is a much bigger coin than VRSC


[06-Dec-18 05:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Iv not read all the posts here yet, boy it moves fast , but, i would just like to say , if i ever managed to save up for a fpga , i would not use it to harm a project , i would probably use it to mine litecoin or bitcoin , or maybe another coin that is ok with asics and fpga‚Äôs on there network , like pirate coin maybe , i dont know enough about pirate coin just yet but i here they have asics on there network, i would like to make it clear also , i would not use an fpga on verus network or any network that is not friendly to them , i support my communities with all my heart and i dont want to see them hurt , also just to make it clear , i could probably never afford to buy an fpga card/machine so all my conversation is kind of me dreaming of owning an fpga , i support this community, i support mike and i support verus project, whatever way we decided to deal with the fpga problem ‚úåüèª


[06-Dec-18 05:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @jl777c If KMD was in this position, theoretically....


[06-Dec-18 05:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I think Vertcoin is in a similar position


[06-Dec-18 05:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> A lot of people are pro fpga, and I get that, but I feel a of people aren‚Äôt listening to others concerns. Verus is still knows as the algo where CPU-mining stood a chance against GPU. Now with FPGA it‚Äôs not profitable at all. So not whether fpgas are the future, but if it‚Äôs ‚Äùright‚Äù for veruscoin. This is why I‚Äôm interested if Mike can keep cpu & gpu profitable or if this is only going to be FPGA moving forward.


[06-Dec-18 05:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> but KMD only has 25% mined by PoW


[06-Dec-18 05:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> and mining is about 20% of the 5% rewards


[06-Dec-18 05:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> What is the positive, to take from this situation? JL777


[06-Dec-18 05:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> ASIC resistance is futile, the borg will win


[06-Dec-18 05:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> unless....


[06-Dec-18 05:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Didn't they have a bounty for someone to develop GPU mining which was a siginificant amount faster than CPU?


[06-Dec-18 05:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> there is a way to make a technical solution that really is fpga/ASIC resistant, which goes beyond the whitepaper


[06-Dec-18 05:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @stretcher83 all the FPGA miners I have spoken to keep saying they are doing VRSC a favor, by increasing hashrate and selling VRSC on the cheap


[06-Dec-18 05:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> üòÇ


[06-Dec-18 05:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @jl777c  So stay true to the White paper?


[06-Dec-18 05:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> yes I paid the BTC bounty for the GPU mining


[06-Dec-18 05:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> developing an ASIC for the community was the whitepaper plan, but that will take time


[06-Dec-18 05:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @jl777c How about a bounty, to develop FPGA resistance?


[06-Dec-18 05:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I think it will just take continual forking form the developers.


[06-Dec-18 05:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> the most security and decentralization is achieved by an algo with a lot of ASIC, all the so called ASIC resistant equihash variants have been fpga mined for a while now, so has XMR and VTC


[06-Dec-18 05:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Unless you had something else in mind @jl777c


[06-Dec-18 05:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> @Gloryman do you know what open CL is?


[06-Dec-18 05:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> no buddy, eager to know


[06-Dec-18 05:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> @Gloryman im a your friend bud , and im also a dedicated member of this verus community, i dont agree with you using my name and other members names to justify your arguments , i dont want to fall out with any of you lot , and so i would like my name kept out of any arguments in the future


[06-Dec-18 05:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> it is a C based language for GPU, that a lot of mining algos are written in. there is now open CL available for fpga


[06-Dec-18 05:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> which means fpga are as programmable as GPU, so if you want an fpga resistant algo, it will also be GPU resistant


[06-Dec-18 05:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Damn.


[06-Dec-18 05:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I just said I told you about FPGAs and chris. How is this using your name to win an argument.


[06-Dec-18 05:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I told many people


[06-Dec-18 05:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> once you realize fpga are basically as programmable as GPU and as fast as ASIC...


[06-Dec-18 05:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Including what is publicly on the discord channel


[06-Dec-18 05:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> This ties in to the Data Streams, or whatever they are called ?


[06-Dec-18 05:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Bitstreams


[06-Dec-18 05:35 AM] actionslacks#4072
the killer mining hardware/app


[06-Dec-18 05:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> the open CL compiler generates bitstreams


[06-Dec-18 05:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> the .exe file for fpga


[06-Dec-18 05:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Patrick ManBearPig @jl777c Thank you gentleman


[06-Dec-18 05:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> it is actually a 64GB map of the transistor layout


[06-Dec-18 05:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Hey maybe the c++ I learned decades ago might come in handy someday


[06-Dec-18 05:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> no c++, only C


[06-Dec-18 05:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Bitstreams are what makes them scary...
Bc ASICs become furniture, but FPGAs adapt


[06-Dec-18 05:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Not that I remember any of it. Just enough to mess me up when I try to learn Node.JS


[06-Dec-18 05:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @jl777c yeah but it will make the bitstreams harder to develop, and disincentive it. But the developers of the GPU miners can be continually incentivized by the foundation. Is this correct?


[06-Dec-18 05:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> the mining rewards incentivez the bitstream devs, so you are incorrect


[06-Dec-18 05:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Its you having an argument/debate with someone and the throwing in others names to say ‚Äútheses people agree with me, @Gloryman you know my stance on this issue, i will not use fpga‚Äôs on verus , i will fight fpga‚Äôs  if need be ( by agreeing to go back to cpu solo mining , even if i know that will drastically reduce my verus earnings the same as if fpgas where left on the network


[06-Dec-18 05:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @jl777c   What do you think is a positive note, for the community to take from this? And, is it best to just ignore it, or what do you think the community should do in response to this?


[06-Dec-18 05:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Ultimately, the FPGA we know about is only earning about $10 a day currently.


[06-Dec-18 05:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> i think we should wait for some technical wizardry from mike, as always


[06-Dec-18 05:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> see what his solution is before prejudging


[06-Dec-18 05:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @jl777c yeah but the mining rewards will be lower because of the continual forking. That's what I thought mike was talking about, when talking about forking. What do you think he meant?


[06-Dec-18 05:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I think something more profitable will come along and they will move on


[06-Dec-18 05:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> the more fpga, the less profitable each one is


[06-Dec-18 05:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @stretcher83 I have never said you agreed with me. When did i say that buddy? not that I have noticed, anyway.


[06-Dec-18 05:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @jl777c So that's why they limit the sell of them?


[06-Dec-18 05:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> yes


[06-Dec-18 05:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> And there are only 5-10 algos


[06-Dec-18 05:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I just hope they don't start selling the Bitstreams


[06-Dec-18 05:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @stretcher83 Also, I never said you wanted to use FPGAs on VRSC.


[06-Dec-18 05:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @jl777c why do you think mike was talking about forking them?


[06-Dec-18 05:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> If it's just a new Hardware market, whatever..
But, if it becomes a Software market... 
People selling Bitstreams to DIY FPGAs


[06-Dec-18 05:41 AM] actionslacks#4072
you adapt or you don't is what it comes down to.  I'm sure the code to update your fpga to whatever you want to mine will be readily available


[06-Dec-18 05:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> if it is possible to make an fpga/asic resistant algo (that is much more than the whitepaper promised), then and only then would it make sense to fork


[06-Dec-18 05:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @jl777c  I respect your staying true, to the White paper


[06-Dec-18 05:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> it isnt my whitepaper, but i think if a CPU advantaged algo can be made, then and only then would it make sense to fork


[06-Dec-18 05:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> What would an FPGA resistant project look like?
100% CPU, no GPU, no ASIC, no FPGA?


[06-Dec-18 05:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @jl777c Well I interpreted the white paper's fair distribution as fair distribution to different types of miners. What do you think fair distribution means in the white paper?


[06-Dec-18 05:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> well 100% CPU mining has always been a temporary thing


[06-Dec-18 05:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Before Bots take over?


[06-Dec-18 05:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> but the longer it can be CPU mined effectively, the more distribution it would get


[06-Dec-18 05:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> first GPU comes along with open CL or cuda based miners


[06-Dec-18 05:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> and now with openCL -> bitstream, the fpga is not far behind


[06-Dec-18 05:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> then the ASIC can use the bitstream as a starting point for its design


[06-Dec-18 05:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> so it is a process


[06-Dec-18 05:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> So Gloryman, you want something to be done to stop FPGAs, until you can afford one? Then what? You will mine something else or you will change your stance again? I'm still confused why you are fudding in here so hard still? You sold out and voted with your feet, but still want to steer the conversation?


[06-Dec-18 05:45 AM] actionslacks#4072
knowing how to code c has become a very profitable skill


[06-Dec-18 05:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> which with effort expended ends up with ASIC for every algo


[06-Dec-18 05:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Back to ASIC lol


[06-Dec-18 05:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @jl777c do you think that CPU and GPU mining only would attract more users of VRSC?


[06-Dec-18 05:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> but verushash was very GPU resistant for a long time, it might be possible to get back to the CPU days


[06-Dec-18 05:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> @Gloryman you sold all your vrsc, why do you care?


[06-Dec-18 05:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @jl777c Yeah this is what i think too


[06-Dec-18 05:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @jl777c I sold it as a temporary response to FPGAs and what i think they will do to the project.


[06-Dec-18 05:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> It's like someone who sold their house still showing up at the HOA meeting and hogging the podium


[06-Dec-18 05:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @jl777c We all get that mining is incentivized, and for a good reason. It costs money, up front, to do it... So it is hard to resist change like this


[06-Dec-18 05:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> But if they return back to how it was before, then I will reinvest and direct mining back to the project.


[06-Dec-18 05:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Patrick ManBearPig Haha.. I used to live here.. but I don't like the new mailboxes


[06-Dec-18 05:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Patrick ManBearPig üòÇ good joke


[06-Dec-18 05:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Or when you get your $2500 and buy the miner you will be demanding that Verus be more FPGA friendly?


[06-Dec-18 05:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> You'll be on the left side of the fence, that day

[06-Dec-18 05:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @jl777c  Can we create a KMD AssetChain, that is designed to resist FPGAs, through different aspects with the overall coin design, or layout?


[06-Dec-18 05:54 AM] actionslacks#4072
you guys are arguing about making verus profitable to mine while the entire crypto market is burning down to the fucking ground


[06-Dec-18 05:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> ahaha I said something similar the other day


[06-Dec-18 05:55 AM] Gateway#3763

or we will have some neat digital souvenir tokens until the whole thing explodes in price again


[06-Dec-18 06:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I don't think it's as much about the price, as it is about what we most know from our lives---that is 10% having probably 90% of all the wealth...
Inherently, as people, we do not like this ...


[06-Dec-18 06:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Justinnn> I'll also post here, why not


[06-Dec-18 06:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Justinnn> So, any ideas how to get more node connections? Seems to be stuck at 4, sometimes 5 and back to 4


[06-Dec-18 06:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Justinnn> I've seen that others had the same problem and nobody knows how to fix it but like everyone has 10+ connections


[06-Dec-18 06:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Did you look in the settings, for a debug log readout? Or something like that?


[06-Dec-18 06:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Justinnn> Even tho it shouldn't matter


[06-Dec-18 06:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Justinnn> other coin daemons work perfectly fine finding other nodes etc


[06-Dec-18 06:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Justinnn> But for verus it's like hardstuck at 4, 5 sometimes but then immediately loses that connection

[06-Dec-18 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> DGB a few weeks ago announced the implementation of the algorithm, which will change every 2 weeks or whether every month. There are also XMR solutions that often change the algorithm.


[06-Dec-18 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> Or a variant which Verge had, several mining algorithms operating simultaneously

[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> @Patrick ManBearPig he contributed to the project, and he's a talented developer. 
Not a PR expert though, at all.
Nevertheless, please be respectful, you cannot imagine how this (and any crypto project) needs devs right now. We need to learn to tolerate each other, even in apparently irreversible situations.

[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> Anyone giving VRSC to their friends for Xmas? It's mid season sale priced so I would consider it a great idea! üéÖ‚òÉ


[06-Dec-18 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @Emmanuel I agree that we should be respectful and not call names, but this is also not a forum for singing praises of someone who was spreading FUD, directly attacking this project and it‚Äôs lead dev through some very childish behavior, especially with inaccuracy regarding past events.  That was not a mistake, that was deliberate.


[06-Dec-18 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> @John Westbrook , we've all been childish or impulsive some times. And we're all on the same boat. 
I remember all the episodes that i've been involved in, all the things that we said to each other üòÖ with some devs, and suddenly we're all working together as komodo notary node operators, because the people, the investors, the whales, the hodlers... believed in us. And that includes Duke - we hadn't a good relationship before the notary node elections, now we have to work together.
You need to understand that we're a very small group of people. Every one is important, even those who are childish or do more mistakes.


[06-Dec-18 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> If everyone stops the comparisons, the accusations, the soul scanning, the labeling... everything settles down on its own. 
As jl777 uses to say - be nice, be tolerant.


[06-Dec-18 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Where has dukeleto spread fud and attacked developer? I'm curious.


[06-Dec-18 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> There was an argument between two men..
It's simple


[06-Dec-18 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Stay out of it and let them resolve it


[06-Dec-18 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> We need to be focused on  the problem, not their argument


[06-Dec-18 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Just curious


[06-Dec-18 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> U know where it is bro?


[06-Dec-18 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> They had words & it's gossip now, imo


[06-Dec-18 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> It's wasted Discord channel space


[06-Dec-18 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I always though thought dukeleto was really smart and contributed some really insightful things


[06-Dec-18 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> Yeah, but it's over now, positions are clear, people in favor of one direction, people in favor of another direction. I say, why not try one, if it doesn't work try the other?


[06-Dec-18 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> That's the advantage of being a relatively young/small project.


[06-Dec-18 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> And Mike is a great developer and even better leader of this project, so... just wait and VRSC will have a better tech.


[06-Dec-18 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Emmanuel buddy I don't see the argument. I have no idea what was said or what direction u are talking about


[06-Dec-18 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> Scroll up.


[06-Dec-18 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> like a lot.


[06-Dec-18 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> It doesn't matter anyway.


[06-Dec-18 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> What am I looking for?


[06-Dec-18 02:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I will search it


[06-Dec-18 02:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> Some people say "go full FPGA", some people say "wait, better try to circumvent it", and that's basically it.


[06-Dec-18 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> In the process of circumventing fpga's might occur that Verus devs find new things. New solutions, new ideas.


[06-Dec-18 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> Creative process is like that.


[06-Dec-18 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Oh I see, what side is dukeleto on?


[06-Dec-18 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> I think that he likes cpu mining, but wants to go full fpga (it's a very exciting tech, to be honest).


[06-Dec-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> Verus core devs want to keep gpu and cpu afloat while allowing some fpga mining.


[06-Dec-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> Which is a very popular option.


[06-Dec-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> Because most people don't have access to fpga's.


[06-Dec-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Ah, I remember  chatting about that


[06-Dec-18 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Yeah, I want cpus and gpus to be relevant again


[06-Dec-18 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> valid option!


[06-Dec-18 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Emmanuel agreed


[06-Dec-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SHossain> no...no...hw placement wrong


[06-Dec-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> joking man,


[06-Dec-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SHossain> sorry


[06-Dec-18 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Lol


[06-Dec-18 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> If team decides to go fight FPGAs - I agree and follow. If we decide to cooperate somehow with miners - I agree and follow. No bad choice here üòÇ I have my personal thoughts on FPGAs acting as a very growth limiting factor for the community, therefore acting as the network effect suppression so basically achievable value suppression too. But I am no tech guy and my point of view is limited to the experience I have. The team could have a different point of view and I will accept that. Lets just allow the team to peacefully reach a decision and act, its all about trust and it always have been, I believe we all await the updates and have already cooled down enough ‚úå


[06-Dec-18 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Gloryman You know what you are doing  anyways. Like I said earlier, take an opinion and stick to it


[06-Dec-18 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @ok88 I like your approach, it is very sound and seems like the smart thing to do.  I just think that the community should be more informed, about what the project is handing over, to keep a specific group of FPGA's mining limited... Bc other models could pop up..
Im not trying to cause any bad feeling or doubt.  It's just an opinion


[06-Dec-18 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> With all of the arguing, not much discussion has actually taken place..


[06-Dec-18 03:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> Well, it has taken place in private channels.


[06-Dec-18 03:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Well, the community is in public...


[06-Dec-18 03:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> What needs to be private, that can't be public?


[06-Dec-18 03:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I guess it doesn't matter....Peace.
Everyone have a great day

[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> They have gloves.
But they also have 280 lbs behind them too


[06-Dec-18 03:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Honestly a consecutive barrage of punches, from them with gloves on, would kill me lol....
They are two Huge guys

[06-Dec-18 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Iv got two quad cores , not much for solo mining , but im still ready to give it ago if need be


[06-Dec-18 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Godballz Will you bet 2k VRSC on me?

[06-Dec-18 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> If I win, I can be like Gloryman and buy an FPGA and complain about CPU being irrelevant, at the same time

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Sure. Some time locked ones

[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Hell, I have a pretty good sense. Thanks for the announcement and clarification, Mike.


[06-Dec-18 07:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> I feel @miketout spelled out pretty clearly what the next steps are, actually, sort of a mini road map- an "autoroadmap" if you will üòÑ on the path forward for dealing with the FPGA question....


[06-Dec-18 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> The carrot, the stick, the open mindedness, the firm stance, the clear eyes, the flexibility and adaptibility- it's all in there....

[06-Dec-18 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> They would be more decentralised ... as there are heaps of them out there... even totall oper source ones


[06-Dec-18 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763

[06-Dec-18 09:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> the problem is if they are not willing to meet at the level playing field that is meant to be verus then they wont be had here

[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> You cant do that

[06-Dec-18 09:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Good announcement, @miketout ! Of course things will change moving forward, but as of right now I think it was the right call to make. g2g to work.


[06-Dec-18 09:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cam [safe.trade]> I have a weird question about forking due to high hash devices (ASICS fpgas etc) if they gain enough hash quickly enough can‚Äôt they basically prevent the fork because they have the most hash? Or it ends up like BSV vs ABC?


[06-Dec-18 09:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cam [safe.trade]> With an actual fork that loses value on both sides?


[06-Dec-18 09:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> Yes ... but in this case its a small group of people. you need the buying power for the coins on the fork. SV has big big money behind it, which is why its working out for them.


[06-Dec-18 09:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> And the fork without a dev team is basically useless.


[06-Dec-18 09:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cam [safe.trade]> Ok. I thought so but just hadn‚Äôt confirmed my thoughts


[06-Dec-18 09:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cam [safe.trade]> @zpajk good point


[06-Dec-18 09:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> Forking verus without Mike would be a pretty poor plan üòÉ


[06-Dec-18 09:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cam [safe.trade]> Although I‚Äôm kind of a ‚Äúthe rule of the code is the rule‚Äù guy, and I don‚Äôt like seeing constant forks. Improvement is good, but not a constant battle. Kind of evolution vs revolution


[06-Dec-18 09:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <blackjok3r> I've stated my opinion on it ... but in the end its mikes desision... Maybe only one fork is required . In that case its probably fine, but just making a better FPGA that is open source is the best plan of action, and then everyone can constantly imporve it. Trying to make the coin CPU and GPU only is a fools errand.


[06-Dec-18 10:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> thanks @zpajk


[06-Dec-18 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Cam [safe.trade] actually, Verus Proof of Power is immune to 51% hash attacks, and then there is dPoW. i suspect they go to other coins for a while, but we will see


[06-Dec-18 10:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> I am sure Mike and his team will solve this problem, our task is to support him


[06-Dec-18 10:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> I would think Verus needs to grow a bigger community of "invested" users in this early stage, and therefore taking miners as example. You're more likely to gather more users as CPU/GPU miners at this point, because FPGAs aren't readily available to a large number of people. If there's not a plan where they all co-exist you'll end up with only a few FPGAs, disencouraging CPU/GPU. Moving forward with larger exchanges and what not, we'll surely be seeing other invested users but as traders/holders/staking, which may render this predicament obsolete.


[06-Dec-18 10:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @blackjok3r i agree with you on the open hardware transition, but i'm not convinced it's a fools errand. i think our approach has a lot of reasons it could work, and we could also have open hardware that is faster without knocking out casual mining completely. we'll see on that too. if we achieve it, i would see no reason to fork again for the algorithm


[06-Dec-18 10:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> @zpajk You forget about the large community of POS miners who stay with Verus for a long time. POS is available to everyone, and it is wonderful that Verus cannot be completely controlled by a narrow circle of people. Fork at which there will be an advantage for the CPU miners will add more decentralization


[06-Dec-18 10:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Didn't forget, I meant POS-investors will be increased with the latter part; by finding investors/stakers through bigger exchanges.


[06-Dec-18 10:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> exactly


[06-Dec-18 10:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Not of course simple math. Exchanges don't necessarily equal more investors, that has to do with marketing, but still.


[06-Dec-18 10:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> @Emmanuel he continues to attack the project and the devs on twitter and in the FPGA discord.


[06-Dec-18 10:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> what do people think about the idea of a staking exchange for Verus?


[06-Dec-18 10:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> an exchange that staked for you on the Verus Coins held there for a fee


[06-Dec-18 10:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> There are some similar exchanges out there for other coins. I have not used them but have looked at them


[06-Dec-18 10:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> For me the fee for a VPS which I can use for other things as well is more valuable. Of course there is a risk of the wallet being stolen but same with an exchange


[06-Dec-18 10:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I would prefer a stronger method of keeping my stake secure


[06-Dec-18 10:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Staking while my coins are on a Trezor, or at least an encrypted wallet


[06-Dec-18 10:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Hey  @miketout. Have u ever thought about a maximum hash rate per a worker on all the pools. Just ban anything above a small you rig, 10 ghs that will stop all the fpgas right. And would be a lot eaiser.


[06-Dec-18 11:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> Why are the devs so afraid of the Fpga miner? They claim vrsc is ok with 51% attack so what‚Äôs the problem ?


[06-Dec-18 11:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I believe mike is trying to protect his vision of the white paper the being fairly distributed verus coin.


[06-Dec-18 11:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I don't think they are afraid of it


[06-Dec-18 11:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> fairly ? This is real life here


[06-Dec-18 11:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> mining isn‚Äôt fair


[06-Dec-18 11:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Gloryman that's an extremely difficult thing to do in decentralized mining, in some ways impossible. pools are independent and can mine according to the protocol the way they want. if they limit hash rate, big miners would go elsewhere. the network mining is only based on addresses and submissions that win. you can't really know for sure how much hash rate anyone has. you can only calculate individual or network hashrate, and the pools of course, can count shares, which mean nothing to the network.


[06-Dec-18 11:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @miketout ok never mind. I thought I was being clever.üòÇ Anyway, really nice announcements mike I'm really looking forward to verus has 2.0


[06-Dec-18 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> thank you üòÉ


[06-Dec-18 11:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @dude personally, I'm not afraid of FPGA miners. I was even arguing to cooperate and work with the FPGA company as we level the playing field, so that FPGAs are still the most professional option, but that CPUs and GPUs are reasonable for casual mining. It might seem surprising, but we really do believe in decentralized mining. We hope that PBaaS will also encourage more decentralized mining and make mining Verus more profitable as well. The more decentralized the network is, the more it will scale, and because of that, there will be a place for even casual miners, if FPGAs don't knock them all out now. We got to a point in discussions where we realized that the sticking point we were trying to secure for the community was that we would have assurance that if we said someone should buy the miners that they would still work after the fork, and it would not be a mistake for the buyer. The company really may not have been trying to be difficult, but they felt they needed to see the full algorithm before release, and we wanted to give them a sense for it with enough information for an FPGA dev to know if they could do it, then get assurance that they would. We realized that if we give them the algo and get no assurance, we would be here, but we would have given the algo that might help the community have a chance to catch up a little while the whole FPGA thing restarts with all of us having the experience of learning from this round. I think for the hardware companies, they need to think about who are their primary customers and how many they will sell.


[06-Dec-18 11:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> For us, we need to think about more decentralization through equalization while not fighting progress.


[06-Dec-18 11:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> If the primary customer of FPGA miners are people who want to snipe coins in secret for maximum ROI, i believe that will remain a small group that actually is self defeating. They harm the coins they snipe, drive the value down, and lose their ROI if the company sells enough to saturate the immediate profit of sniping.


[06-Dec-18 11:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> If the customer is coin communities wanting to do much better on their coin, but not centralize everything, then they either need to think super high volume for explicitly the miner market, which i think is coming, or serve growing communities with the best miner that still can coexist with others


[06-Dec-18 11:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Honestly @miketout , I think there are a lot of FPGA trolls on this forum trying to promote verus hash going completely towards FPGA mining. But I think your direction is much better. Also, I have a question, jl777 said that the white paper thought that fairly distributed didn't mean equalising the miners but I thought it did. Can you explain what you mean by fairly distributed?


[06-Dec-18 11:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Dude, @Gloryman would you please stop?


[06-Dec-18 11:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> You sold your stake. Everyone is pretty clear on your stance


[06-Dec-18 11:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Even people in the FPGA group tell you the same thing when you post in there


[06-Dec-18 11:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Patrick ManBearPig I believe I am asking reasonable questions to mike. mike can tell me if im asking stupid questions.


[06-Dec-18 11:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> " I think there are a lot of FPGA trolls on this forum"

Why should anyone care what you think at this point?

[06-Dec-18 11:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we cannot always have everything equal. fair to me is generally you put more in, you get more out in a fair measure. i don't think that is the part that would drive a desire to equalize hardware because fair just means everyone can technically do the same thing with the same resources. that wouldn't preclude all FPGA in my opinion, but that would be centralizing. the reason to equalize in a reasonable way if it can be done, IMO, is to get more decentralization and a growing network


[06-Dec-18 11:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i believe that if someone is willing to spend explicitly on mining crypto currency, which is what they're doing with an FPGA today, they should get a premium ROI for that commitment


[06-Dec-18 11:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Sweet. I completely agree. With more casual miners, that means we can expand and help the community build. Also, were you talking about the new RTX cards with tensor cores? I was wondering what kind of performance boost they could provide.


[06-Dec-18 11:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> but i also believe that people should reasonably be able to get an ROI on common hardware, which should translate into profit in a better market


[06-Dec-18 11:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Chris was saying that, and I believe he was talking about many GPUs


[06-Dec-18 11:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @miketout is getting good ROI on the hardware a short term or a long term goal of verus. Because is this achievable when the asics arrive?

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> my nephew got a pretty decent bag early on on his notebook, and he started during the time locks. we've got 24 rewards for some time now. unless we get very big very fast, ASICs may take a while, as our algorithm is not currently used across a large enough economy to justify it. that may change, but i would like to preserve some ability for different types of miners as long as possible as an on ramp for as many people as possible. everyone has a right to do that on Discord with no centralized control, and I'm trying to be clear in what i say.


[06-Dec-18 11:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> if you mean deleting something a couple days ago, i'd prefer to leave that discussion behind, and consider each deletion a retroactive biting of tongue


[06-Dec-18 11:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @miketout you are clear. I mean you type and delete what you are typing. This was just a joke. I think you are just very careful about grammar or something so you dont sound like a ordinary forum user. üòÇ


[06-Dec-18 11:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @miketout Oh I get it, you made this coin to make your nephew rich! (just joking)


[06-Dec-18 11:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @miketout Thanks for chatting to me today. I will let you get back to work. you are actually the most active developer I have spoken too and a real inspiration . I want to start developing on KMDlabs.

[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> thanks üòÉ


[06-Dec-18 11:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> so just fork verus everytime we see fpgas?


[06-Dec-18 11:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @dude agreed


[07-Dec-18 12:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @dude no. i am hopeful this fork will equalize them enough when they come back. if things work as expected, that will be tuneable at the next hard fork for any other reason as well


[07-Dec-18 12:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> when is the fork coming? when I take a look into the hashrate distribution its like every normal miner is getting  [x] rekt

[07-Dec-18 12:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I know it's not possible, but it would be a nice turn of events if the fork could be kept secret from the fpga miners üòé


[07-Dec-18 12:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> And they were left wondering where their algo1 went

[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Lol...


[07-Dec-18 12:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> I really do appreciate this community...it's such a refuge from the insanity out there...I mean, it's like being in a bubble...the larger cryptosphere is going to hell in a hand basket and we couldn't be more oblivious, as we go back and forth on how best to raise this nascent project...sniff...it almost brings a tear to the eye....


[07-Dec-18 12:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Ironically, if the project succeeds as we hope, this will someday be a thing of the past as all manner of crypto riff-raff start barging in here yelling "when moon?!" Well, until such time....


[07-Dec-18 12:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Wishful thinking: a larger number of "common" miners get to tag along long enough (financial gains) to make an adequate decision to invest in community supported fpgas in the future. Not just close knit early adopted fpga buyers who want to "snipe" algos. (Not meant to provoke)


[07-Dec-18 12:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Something I am unsure about is how the mining hash rate/difficulty affects staking, if at all. Does a staker's chances fluctuate based on that? Because of how the 50/50 balance is maintained?

[07-Dec-18 01:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> OK  - been watching this all unfold. There is no "secret society". As a loyal and committed GPU miner, I also have FPGA's. The effect on Verus does concern me. That said - not a secret hidden group of "secret miners" - it is called innovation and the fact of the matter is FPGA is really efficient. And when people innovate on new tech they don't just "put it out there to share". It's brutal and hard fact of POW. All mining is about staying one step ahead, not trying to hurt individual and great projects. But the straight up facts are ... FPGAs are here. Many different companies and devs are in a race to develop efficient algorithms. It's evolution or we would be all mining on our palm pilots in the back of a horse buggy. So yes - it sucks. Fully get that. But you simply have to embrace it and adopt. Fork, modify, whatever. But no secret society out to get you - just folks with fast hardware that smokes GPU on this algorithm. Crypto won't survive if people blame innovation for distributing their calm peaceful world. Everything is disruption right now. I am holding a big chunk of Verus as love the passion and the project. But hating the FPGA folks is just crazy and misguided - it's here, it real, and it's not "a company" or "centralized party" coming after you. I am going to hate myself for posting this but come on - stop blaming some centralized evil system and just realize that tech innovation caught you off guard and you will need to adapt. How far behind do you think ASICS would be. Don't negotiate a peace treaty - INNOVATE.


[07-Dec-18 01:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lumbi> "If the primary customer of FPGA miners are people who want to snipe coins in secret for maximum ROI, i believe that will remain a small group that actually is self defeating. They harm the coins they snipe, drive the value down, and lose their ROI if the company sells enough to saturate the immediate profit of sniping."
üëÜüèª    This is the kind of stance BTC is sorely lacking. It's really refreshing being a part of VRSC!


[07-Dec-18 01:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> Everyone is free to mine for their own reasons - maybe profit, maybe a love of a project. It doesn't matter. Fast hardware is here, and I am sure faster hardware is coming. It's just the reality, not a value judgement.


[07-Dec-18 01:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> @Lumbi how to you think the CPU miners feel about the GPU folks? Victimized? Seriously. It's like watching the horse carriage folks be pissed at Henry Ford. Everyone has their own intentions, and I can't speak to that. But the only point is - it doesn't matter. It is a fact of life now. New fast shit is coming out and it will not stop. Soon the current FPGAs will be outdated. I am concerned about the impact on project like this - doesn't matter what I think. It's coming either way.


[07-Dec-18 02:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I agree with much of what you are saying @GEBucky but the way people in that f1 discord have treated the guy who let the secret out shows there was a so called secret society


[07-Dec-18 02:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> ya - I get it. Look - when someone gets a jump (and they are short lived jumps for sure), they understandably attempt to protect their dev investment. I wouldn't read to much into that.


[07-Dec-18 02:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> @GEBucky , this algo promotes competivness for CPU against GPU, you're using a bad comparison


[07-Dec-18 02:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> Not a BTC maximalist but Satoshi's vision was POW was not about democracy, it was about WORK. It's just a fact that new hardware can do the work more efficiently and quite a bit faster. I do hope ( and believe) that FPGA are better suited to larger algos as it just doesn't scale otherwise. But is so NOT personal against verus.


[07-Dec-18 02:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> FPGA is better, and will be something to look forward to. But right now too few people have FPGA and care about the project. Face it, if everybody had FPGAs it would be as sought after to mine with fpga.


[07-Dec-18 02:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> @zpajk well they missed a note in the process. I am not being confrontation at all - but it just is man. Hating doesn't help. Innovation does. I would love to see more algos that can balance it better. But it will continue to be a race - crypto will be better for it but it's not without f**up situations like this. But protecting the CPU miner isn't decentralization - at all. So I have sympathy but what I think doesn't matter.


[07-Dec-18 02:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Whose hating? The main "hater" is posting in the other discord about how he wants to buy one


[07-Dec-18 02:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> And doesn't even own any Verus


[07-Dec-18 02:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Not trying to be dismissive, but I feel you're not talking out of a verus perspective. So I don't know if there's any point in the discussion


[07-Dec-18 02:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> And by the way - FPGA's aren't that expensive if you do your homework. I am not trying to justify the reality - just trying to put it into context


[07-Dec-18 02:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> @Patrick ManBearPig +1 one that


[07-Dec-18 02:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> The other most vocal anti-fpga voice is also in their discord wanting to buy one


[07-Dec-18 02:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Mike has been in contact with them and not they've not come to another understanding. I have full trust in his ability to do so.

[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I wish I had a mining rig of any kind right now. My apartment is freezing!


[07-Dec-18 02:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> Folks - there is no "understanding". It's not one company. Or a centralized anything. Next fast algo probably right behind it. It will settle down as low volume coins don't make sense - so kinda a sucky moment in time. But gonna have to strap in. We all have to. Again - this is a GREAT project - and have been watching from a distance tying to see both sides.

[07-Dec-18 02:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @GEBucky just to be clear, most people are not against fpgas or innovation. They want to protect the project. The coin has gone down 66% as fpga mining has increase. I agree with mike about coin sniping being damaging to both communities. And i want there to be what is best for both communities. Forking for now is best and working together at a later stage is good too.


[07-Dec-18 02:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Mike explains the current situation perfectly in #announcements  , I feel no need to write the same thing over and over again. Things will be different in the future, but as of right now there's no consensus between fpgas and verus.


[07-Dec-18 02:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> "The coin has gone down 66% "

Bullshit

[07-Dec-18 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> @zpajk If you have a POW algo- the whole point is you don't care about the intent of miners. It's part of the trustless part. Innovation is painful yes, but don't see any signs of 51pct attack or fucking up the integrity of the blockchain. It's just folks with really fast miners - for now until faster yet stuff comes along


[07-Dec-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Hey,  @Post and  @Patrick ManBearPig shall we just not talk to each other. Sound fair? Are u going to follow me around and disagree with everything I say?

[dscrdvrsc] <Post> If its not true, yes, i will


[07-Dec-18 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> If anything no conclusion at all can be drawn from the price action of verus due to the low volume of trading. A stronger case could be made that the price dilution is because the trading is now spread across 3 exchanges rather than 1 at the time of the price spike. Not to mention the absolute dump the entire market has taken.

[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Would you stop trying to monopolize the conversation at every opportunity?


[07-Dec-18 02:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> @Lumbi yep - skipped past the bitchy coments above üòÉ But you are spot on. And by the way - it's not China. Its US, Europe, Asia at large, and from what I can gather not a lot centralization but indiviuals hosting on platforms.  but there is some risk in pool centralization on Verus. Most attacks don't come from pools - they come from people buying shit tons on NiceHash - your algo isn't there so that's good. Frankly you will get cheap coins from the flippers, and it will settle down in a week or two (better algo to chase or fork). Regardless I am keeping mine as think it's a cool project

[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> @miketout  if "secret mining" is bad then why private money are good ?


[07-Dec-18 07:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> @miketout  My thoughts on FPGAs
The 'promise' of FPGA in coins they can successfully mine is that they are about 7x the cost  of gpu with 11x the speed. (ballpark). 
As I see it though.. on Verus they are currently about to gain 17-20x gpu.  Verus might be the most profitable thing for FPGA's to mine currently. 
If more miners had the bitstream, then the hashrate would go even higher. 
To gain parody, the FPGA's hashrate would have to be taken down to around 7x that of a GPU. IMO 
Eventually this same conversation will come up with ASICS
If at any point we give up the fight for parody, what was even the point of trying to make CPU and GPUs equal if it quickly got overrun but the next bigger thing?
Unless VRSC fights for parody to the end, then there was no point.

[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I believe all of us here want the best for verus , which might just be allowing fpga‚Äôs to mine verus or not ,( I totally get the decentralised aspect , anyone should be able to mine verus ) but on the other hand , the people that decide to secretly mine verus with fpga‚Äôs choses to go a different route to all the rest of us, they kept it quiet instead of openly announcing it to us all ,even if they knew most of us regulars haven‚Äôt got any fpga‚Äôs , they could have simply just told us all at the time they have cracked it and made a fpga able to mine verus , we all could then have worked together to see what we could do to keep the smaller hash rate contributors still in the game , maybe even all put together and purchase or rent 1 or a few fpga‚Äôs for the verus community to share the hash rate , i know, not the greatest idea but , more along the lines of community spirit , maybe im well off the mark , i dont know , all i know is this has been a bad time for us on discord having to deal with mixed emotions over the subject , i would love it if we could all mine verus together cpu,gpu,and fpga, but i can see theres lots of factors in the way at the moment , i will vote with my limited knowledge of the subject , to make verus a good and fair project to follow for all , but i will be disappointed if the verus fpga miners decide to go there own path and just keep everything to them selfs and not be open about it , like before , we need more community spirit together , and not two separate verus communities working against each other , even though this is a community decision that we need to make , i thank mike for his patience and understanding , i think hes doing a bloody good job so far trying to be fair and i wish him the best of luck bringing both communities together , if possible, ü§û

[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Hey @stretcher83 . Me and mike had a good chat this morning and I think the issue is pretty conclusive now. The other community is not cooperating fully. So, he is creating a fork of verus so that it limits the hash rate of FPGAs, Verus hash 2.0. This is a great solution in my opinion and hopefully stop the driving down of the price of Verus.

[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @miketout Do you know when the verus hash 2.0 will be in effect and do we need to use updated miners?


[07-Dec-18 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> yep @jl777c Read that.. I was just adding my thoughts into the situation and just outlining its an important fight to fight. Just thinking out loud with some numbers and stats.


[07-Dec-18 09:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> this situation is quite interesting actually.. 
the dev team have been killing it..
now this stand as another test, on that is real world and happening now
Can Verus come out with another win that betters the whole community with more tech to upstream. ? üòÉ

[07-Dec-18 09:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Hi all, seems we have concerns. I understand, and it's no fun across crypto, but until we get onto to more exchanges, for example Cryptopia and others, we are subject to sentiment of a few. personally, i'm going to roll with that in this market. last night, based on the trades, someone, maybe 2 people, but I think maybe one in two trades, sold a little over 11K in a few minutes, and we went down. I don't know about anyone else, but I can't call that a trend. If it's shaking weak hands, then we will get stronger, I believe. We are small now, and it doesn't take that much to do that to the down or upside. I realize some people might think that is a telling sign for the future, but personally, I can't see it as telling for post-VerusHash 2.0 or beyond. We could go further down, or we could go up. We've been counted out before, and it hasn't been true. I wish we could all have perfect future-vision, but we can only have vision and work towards making it the future. Right now, we make VerusHash 2.0, and if it doesn't equalize the way we think, we can adjust or tune. If I didn't think there's a very good chance we will be much more equalized, hopefully with FPGAs at less than 7x, maybe much less, I'd change the algo until I did. In any case, I probably won't have an FPGA bitstream to iterate and test unless someone develops the bitstream for us and that purpose. I believe I could likely dive in, bite the bullet to learn what I need and do it myself, but that would be too inefficient. Once someone does develop a bitstream and we get numbers on the new algo, we will reevaluate then. At the end of it, we still have all of our options. If we are impatient, then we can be worried, otherwise, I don't think we are in bad shape.


[07-Dec-18 09:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> In fact, I feel this has helped us in ways we might not see yet. We have more dev resources across the community asking to help, which is great. We have our own plan that, if successful, will be a model for others, and if not, we can solve it in one way or another.


[07-Dec-18 09:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> Currerntly we are in a market where price has little representation of performance. I would not worry about price. We are in the great washout. A part of that is price (weak hands).. but the bigger washout is weak tech. This is the only thing to focus on..


[07-Dec-18 09:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Thanks @miketout . I'm really looking forward to Verus 2.0. Do you have a time frame? Also, what is the relationship between Verus and chips? Is chips part of Verus?


[07-Dec-18 09:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> If the crypto market does anything well, it's test you to see what you are made of. And it does this, over and over. I've met nobody that can predict the future. You just do the best that you can, in this market, to respect and stay true to yourself & always be measuring your  Risk v Reward. The way I see it, Verus did exactly that.  And we can't honestly say, it was for certain the best move. We need time to be able to say that. But Verus did deal with something that 95% of crypto projects would have no sustainable answer.


[07-Dec-18 09:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Gmoney that's my feeling too. My priority now is to get this next release nailed, and then to get back to PBaaS work while the bitstream developers go at it. Once they have something, either people will mine in secret, or they will see that we don't inherently hate technology and decide they might do better to let us know this time. If someone comes to me/us to offer bitstream testing as soon as it's available, we should reward them with a welcome, even if our new algo doesn't equalize as much as we'd like. Then we decide our next move, no nail biting, IMO, just work on what we can and adjust if necessary on this. Most of us, if not all, hope it's not necessary to adjust at all. I personally think there's a good chance of that, but as with many things we've done, this actually hasn't been done yet, so no one, not even the bitstream devs, know for sure. @Gloryman the target time frame is in the announcement as well, and I wouldn't call it Verus 2.0 yet üòÉ only VerusHash.

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> so, you don't have to go back and read it again, we said within a couple weeks is the release target. Thanks @Cruz , but I also see the same vision in people among the community. I have a vision for this project, but I'm sure I'm not the only one in sync with it based on a lot of conversations. Nothing in what is happening now shakes (or actually even impacts) my belief in the long term vision.

[07-Dec-18 09:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @miketout what about chips I see there is a verustest channel


[07-Dec-18 09:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> are they using verushash for chips?


[07-Dec-18 09:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Go ask


[07-Dec-18 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> CHIPS uses sha256d, I believe, which had ASICs. I helped them get VerusHash in for testing. Now that we see what likely some of the best FPGA devs can do, on our last integration, we will iterate. The current algorithm uses AVX and AESENC instructions in very tight code, and the issue is that while it leverages CPU optimizations enough to near equalize GPUs, that doesn't take enough space on the FPGA layout to prevent significant HW parallelism. The new approach leverages much more CPU integrtion, much more than originally, and in much tighter code that I hand tuned over some of the fastest code using it in the world today. It does a complex operation called a carryless multiply (kind of), further optimized to lean even more heavily on those instructions. As far as FPGAs go, there is research showing that this has unique challenges to make performant on hardware, especially the way we are using it. Right now, I can only go by research and theory, and then the chaos of the real world will test that theory.


[07-Dec-18 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> GPUs were not quite equalized before. that may change with this algo too


[07-Dec-18 10:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @miketout Thats really interesting. Do you know any good resources to help me better understand what you just wrote?


[07-Dec-18 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I actually think that predominatly CPU mining is better for the project. Also,  I have a threadripper üòÉ


[07-Dec-18 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> It will not be exactly the code in this, but very similar in approach. This paper mentions some of the instructions we will be using, but says testing them is beyond scope: http://etd.lib.metu.edu.tr/upload/12618023/index.pdf


[07-Dec-18 10:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Gloryman all solutions have issues. as someone pointed out to me when discussing this, CPUs also mean botnets. I think ideally, we should have CPUs and GPUs able to mine reasonably and FPGAs that are fast enough to be the professional solution. I think that will result in maximum miner decentralization over time.


[07-Dec-18 10:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @miketout Yeah, Thanks for paper. I'm looking forward to KMDlabs apparently they teach newbies how all this stuff works and I'm anxious to learn.


[07-Dec-18 10:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i'm sure that will be a great experience and super useful for learning. at the same time, i don't think there is a place besides the fire of doing a project with a world of people leveraging any tech they can to get an advantage that can teach you many of these things üòÉ


[07-Dec-18 10:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @miketout Yeah, I guess Its one of those subject without a textbook to teach you because the writers and teachers are busy getting rich instead of writing textbooks.


[07-Dec-18 10:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> @miketout perhaps time to collaborate at least in conversation with Kristy/OhGodaGirl. As the dev for ProgPow (which is the only other algo that seeks parity)  and quite knowledgeable about FPGA's as they were a focus of Minority hosting. (Although minority is closing up shop and sending their FGPA business and hosting to SQRL. I'm not sure what project she is moving onto). Either way, seems like a great place to start.

[dscrdvrsc] <Justinnn> Just a question


[07-Dec-18 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Justinnn> So I got a transfer of 1000 tokens which arrived but was later sent to 4 addresses, any idea what happened?

[07-Dec-18 11:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> someone who has the private keys of this address: RAf5mi6Ma9fSwGa7SeziW2rQa2qnAAuMia, signed the transaction to send it to the 4 addresses in this transaction: https://explorer.veruscoin.io/tx/f5536df9be77c8f8611dcec64d5fa74435e416ca5cc52d98dd676648d8ab8ed8


[07-Dec-18 11:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> if that's not you, then someone has the private key


[07-Dec-18 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Justinnn> Not sure how that can happen as it was created yesterday


[07-Dec-18 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Justinnn> Through the daemon


[07-Dec-18 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Justinnn> Or like 2 days ago


[07-Dec-18 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Justinnn> The private key was also not yet dumped, so literally there's no way someone had the private key


[07-Dec-18 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Justinnn> Also, only 1000 tokens were taken which were transfered 10 minutes before, nothing else


[07-Dec-18 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Justinnn> That's why I'm asking


[07-Dec-18 01:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Justinnn> still no idea what happened


[07-Dec-18 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Justinnn> So, the thing is. Someone made a donation to the fee address


[07-Dec-18 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Justinnn> 10 minutes after the payment was received, it was sent to the 4 addresses, of which 3 are mining on the pool, and one is random and I've never seen it


[07-Dec-18 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Justinnn> why? that's a good question


[07-Dec-18 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it's a good question. you may have one of the types of malware that takes your wallet.dat. they are in the wild. i see that the address was first used yesterday, as you say. it also looks like you're still using it for mining. the transaction to those 4 addresses was definitely signed by the private key of this address. you're right that there's no normal way someone could get that if it was made by your wallet yesterday unless they got it from you or your machine, and there's no way that transaction could have been signed with current technology unless someone had it. since you're mining to the same address, if you believe it is compromised, I'd recommend moving funds to an address that is not. somehow, the facts are that the transaction that moved that 1000 VRSC was signed by the private key, and if someone other than you has that, I would somehow get another address to mine to.


[07-Dec-18 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Justinnn> I've answered via PM


[07-Dec-18 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Justinnn If you can recall any downloads, links, or general risky behavior, it could be very helpful in preventing something like this happening again to someone else if it is in fact a form of malware.

[07-Dec-18 10:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> From the few small short videos I saw she seems pretty intelligent


[07-Dec-18 10:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Wasn't she part of the group that released the ethlargement pill or am I mistaking her for someone else?


[07-Dec-18 10:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> If so, that's pretty clever/cool


[08-Dec-18 08:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Greer> Yes she is one of the contributors and behind the group that calls themselves OhGodACompany, they released the free version of the pill. 
She is also part of a separate group of developers called IfDefElse that created ProgPoW. 
She is also currently the CTO of the DC Core Scientific, previously Mineority and more previously Genesis Mining. 
Many rumors about other technologies such as the Bitmain eth asic that she may or may not have created and had stolen.


[08-Dec-18 09:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> She definitely didn't end up there by accident. As I said, from the short videos I've seen she seems very knowledgeable.  I apologize if I've misinterpreted your last sentence but did you mean to imply that she had a hand in the creation of the eth asic or did you mean she was able to create and steal an eth asic from bitmain?


[08-Dec-18 10:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Looks like she does some work on fpga and asic design but also a lot to fight them using that knowledge. Found an article she wrote about progpow that reiterates and expands on some of what we've said and seems relevant- <https://medium.com/@OhGodAGirl/thank-you-alexander-for-your-constructive-feedback-d39078079186>

[08-Dec-18 11:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Pretty eerie, in the second medium link she draws an analogy of blockchains as 4wd cars on a race track vs the new asic racecar coincidentally named F1.

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> It was just funny that the recently discovered miner is also coincidentally named F1, making it all the more easy to relate


[08-Dec-18 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Greer> @Godballz I read someone state that she created a theoretical eth asic and the design was stolen and put into production


[08-Dec-18 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Greer> The devcon talk is a good watch. On BBT


[08-Dec-18 01:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> The techniques progpow use are interesting and seem like legitimate ways to keep gpu/cpu relevant by utilizing hardware specific to themselves  and effectively making them asics. These concepts can be useful in finding new solutions and approaches to the inherent problems of maintaining balance in an ideally decentralized market. I don't want to get too hung up on any one fix as I'm sure they all have their trade-offs but I think it's good to consider all the angles. However it goes, I'm confident that because we have a clever and capable team working this out, we'll get the solution that suits us best.


[08-Dec-18 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> There are some real differences between what we're doing in VerusHash 2.0 and ProgPoW right now. ProgPoW ensures that low end commodity CPUs remain relevant for some time, they seem to feel indefinitely. We currently believe our approach solves some issues in a similar way, but others in a way that should be more resistant to bot nets. I'm looking forward to our discussions, and I can always learn. At the same time, I'm feeling pretty good about our approach for the long term. They are open source, and I've already looked through the source. Maybe she will illuminate some advantages of which I'm currently unaware.


[08-Dec-18 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cryptonoobie> @Godballz thanks for sharing that post.  That was an extremely interesting and eye-opening read.  I think I'm a little smarter after reading it as well, if I understood everything correctly.  The referenced slides about blockchain attacks was excellent as well.


[08-Dec-18 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Greer> ProgPoW extends a memory hard algo, it is not an algo of its own. It is tuned for gpu not cpu.  The ethash implementation consumes ~10w per MH across most modern gpu‚Äôs. It is unlikely fpga‚Äôs or asics would do better than a 10% efficiency gain if anything at all. CPUs would not do well

[dscrdvrsc] <Greer> Watch the devcon talk to see how compromises were made to accommodate amd cards. Not something an nvidia shill would do. 
Look at you Linux mining distro, in particular the tool that allows you to overclock your amd cards, it‚Äôll be named wolfamdctrl or the newer version renamed OhGodATool. The name should offer clues about any biases. 
Research further and you will find a business selling amd bios mods. 
If still unconvinced, ProgPoW is open source code, read the code.

[08-Dec-18 11:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> They seem to have taken one interesting approach but it will be interesting to see new emerging solutions to these issues as well and how the market at large reacts. Fortunately we have a very capable team behind us with the experience to pull us through while possibly setting a new standard in fair hashrate distribution. I'm open to new ideas and if able, would choose to set precedent rather then fall in line. Whatever happens, it's turning out to be an exciting and pivotal time dispite the recent overall market downturn


[08-Dec-18 11:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Hey  @wind , welcome to the discord. I just wondered what your view is about the fork situation and also why didnt u want to work with mike to develop a more reasonable hashrate fpga?


[09-Dec-18 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <wind> As a miner manufacturer,we are open to every coin dev team and coin community. And we firmly believe that the FPGA miner has many advantages for digital currency, and people will accept it more and more.


[09-Dec-18 12:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> You are not wrong in saying that fpga has certain advantages that will benefit digital currencies but more specifically it can be said the benefits are in favor of the manufacturer, not the miners. What happens when everyone adopts an f1 and the new f2 comes out? Same problem for miners, more money for the manufacturers. A more balanced solution is needed for long term sustainability. Pos, which we fortunately have, seems to be one and there are many talented minds working on a better pow now as well.

[09-Dec-18 07:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Greer> @Takoy_Nahal up until the fmv exploit mentioned in the talk above ethash has been the most asic resistant which is why the current asics have such a small advantage over gpu‚Äôs.
The goal of ProgPoW isn‚Äôt to resist any kind of hardware, instead, get consistent hash per watt across all hardware types so that one does not have an advantage over another because as soon as one has an advantage all you did was push difficulty up and centralized your hash. This is explained by Kristys Medium post and misunderstood by so many, otherwise smart, people.


[09-Dec-18 07:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Greer> The current implementation of ProgPoW extends ethash, it could be applied to other memory hard algorithms such as equihash or possibly mtp


[09-Dec-18 07:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> @Greer Since Asic and FPGA inevitably come to every GPU algorithm, the Progpow solution looks the most reasonable. The coexistence of all types of mining tools where no one has an advantage sounds great


[09-Dec-18 07:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> @wind People will take your Fpga when it costs reasonable money, sold in any store and have a 3 year warranty from the manufacturer. And now it‚Äôs a good network capture tool with a small number of miners.


[09-Dec-18 07:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Greer> It has been designed fo ~10w per MH so far tests on fpga gain no efficiency on that, asic emulation shows the potential for up to 20% gain but to get that a manufacturer would effectively be building a gpu to compete with intel and nvidia. If they can do that there is more money in selling gpu‚Äôs.


[09-Dec-18 07:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> Very good,  It would be nice if many projects have implemented such a solution.


[09-Dec-18 07:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Greer> @wind what is discussed on the fpga discord is one very biased side of a story. I gather that your company know something about fud and have experienced a little yourself.


[09-Dec-18 07:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Greer> Speaking of fud. Can you justify the predatory nature of keeping bitstreams secret?


[09-Dec-18 07:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> I am very annoyed by the talk that the FPGA and ASIC are more advanced miners, that the future is behind them. BUT I want to say to these guys, not everything is measured in cryptospace by numbers and hashrate number. For many projects, first of all, it is important to involve the community, increase the number of interested people,
and you are the producers of pieces of iron trying to convince us that we should step aside and hand over to the major miners. Decentralization is, first of all, a more equitable distribution, the participation of all people regardless of their financial situation.
And I am sure you are FPGA producers, as now Bitmain will fly into the abyss with your immense greed and stupidity


[09-Dec-18 09:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> It‚Äôs difficult to increase community.  People are only looking at roi when it comes to mining. Which is difficult in this environment.


[09-Dec-18 10:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> how would everyone feel about FPGAs if they had much more similar hash/$, better hash/watt, the code for them was open source, and we could organize community group purchases for a discount?

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i have graphics cards, and I was thinking if we did that, I'd trade my cards by selling them and buying FPGAs. this is a real discussion with no conclusion yet, and it includes the algo changes as well for equalization. Right now, I'm pretty confident that the price point would likely be in the < $500 range. i have a solution in the current algorithm work to make it arbitrarily memory hard as well, which would make such a price point impossible, so this option would mean leaving the door open to FPGAs as we try to equalize them.

Even if i dont get to participate in buying an fpga , i still think its a good idea ,

[09-Dec-18 11:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Takoy_Nahal> The FPGA idea would be good if FPGA could be bought at any store and at an affordable price for many people.


[09-Dec-18 11:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I‚Äôd trust you to host them @stretcher83 üòÉ or maybe some pools would want to step up. @Takoy_Nahal the price seems affordable at the level we‚Äôre talking, and those with graphics cards should be able to manage an upgrade, since people will still want GPUS for mining as well as other things. If a company takes this approach and it works for Verus, I think enough projects would follow that the may become available broadly. Right now, it‚Äôs an important question that relates to the algo and possible cooperation. We still have options, and one is not to go for cooperation. The idea of an open bitstream and less electric usage without killing today‚Äôs miners is quite appealing.


[09-Dec-18 11:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Greer> Save on electric bills?  Consider a new miner only burns 1 watt per MH instead of 10 watts per MH.  Someone running a farm can now afford to run 10x more miners, the difficulty goes up and everyone buys more hardware.  Same amount of energy is now being burned, same amount of reward per watt spent (because of difficulty) just more hardware to burn it.

[09-Dec-18 11:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Greer> The only metric that matters in PoW is watts burned per hash. 
People will always try to game that to be one of few gaining more of a share of the reward while burning less electricity, if successful they devalue all other miners rewards, centralize the hash and devalue the project.


[09-Dec-18 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Hi @miketout . This is a really interesting idea and it would take a lot of consideration. Firstly, I think it would limit the coin income on people using cpus and gpus because it would increase the total hash rate but reduce the hash ratio for cpus and gpus. Secondly, I think it would therefore make it harder to encourage new miners and new members to the community. Thirdly, buying an FPGA for 1 coin is a big and risky investment in my opinion. If verus coin falls then we would have wasted $500. Fourthly, buying verus FPGAs doesn't guarantee that other FPGA makers can make faster FPGAs and therefore make our FPGA useless. If you could address these issues I would be very grateful. I'm quite undecided about this issue

[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Alright Yeah. I've been watching videos on them for months. There are a lot of horror stories. People cant program them, they break down and the company doesn't help them. The top coins on the bit stream get forked or plummet. They are great and I want one but it takes a lot more consideration before buying GPU.

[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> If there is like an independent company or some other arrangement to help us use the FPGA for mining other coins in case verus nose dive then that's ok. But if not we I will lack the skills to code or even download someone else's bitstream on to it.

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Gloryman Actually, there is a company that would like to cooperate to make an open source Verus bitstream and release a new product that would also support other bitstreams with a deal for community pre-orders. What I'm seeing in these responses is real concern that some early community members or soon to be early community members might still have their on-ramp priced out, and that concerns me a bit.

[09-Dec-18 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Hey  @miketout I have some ideas on this. Firstly, I think there are better ways to attract new people, like raindrops and games. I have got so many alt coins of coins I don't even know they are for. And, lots of people have fun chatting on these forums. It's also a great way for us to get other people involved from other forums because everyone want free coins and this would only cost the foundation a few dollars a day. Secondly, I think fpgas being based on multiples of cpu miners will really limit the impact of fpgas on the hash rates because it will chase off the super heavy ROI chasers. Also, people in the community will likely not be coin dumping and therefore driving the coin down. A more stable coin is more attractive and might mean that cpu miners make more money because they Will get less of a ratio of the hash but a coin that has a higher dollar value (assuming u can stop the other fpgas). Thirdly, another way to reduce the risk of fpgas limiting newbies is if the fpgas had other coins that could be mined for a similar level of profit. Forthly, another great way to encourage new people is to host fpgas and buy part of that fpga, like sell 20% for $100. Fithly, another way to help new people is to donate hash to small old cpu miners and gpu miners if they are mining at 100 mhs on and old cpu, you could use part of the fpga farm to give them 200mhs.  Sixthly, lol, I think the biggest problem is not a well devised fpga implementation. The biggest problem is protecting the network from super big and aggressive fpga miners, because they damage the coins stability as well as the community miners. If u can sell fpgas and limit the big fpgas, you got us self a winner. Just my thoughts.

Apparently half of the reward issued is done through the proof of stake system but is that reward the same as the mining reward? 
As far as I can tell it's just about 25 tokens per block is it the same for proof of stake?
Do you have to have a certain amount in order to participate in the proof of state if so how much? what would be the expected reward? Are there different tiers or does the amount change over time?

Thanks

[dscrdvrsc] <Skyblayde> i have 3   i9-9900k/ NVIDIA 10809ti SC2 Hybrids. not sure if its worth mining anymore with normal hardware. was guided over to verus recently and reading up, not much info on the site, seems kind of empty compared to other cryto sites. not muich in the way of explaining things for noobs like myself.


[11-Dec-18 07:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Skyblayde> it seems nicehash profitability is very low , 40-60 cents per day per hardware. which is kind of crappy if you ask me. i mean cmon, thats like 15 bucks a month. for one  pc.  and thats not even half the what the power bill is gonna be. >_<

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Question... if we are able to get an update out and the fork quickly, but Chris, Pallas, or someone else can't update the GPU miners immediately, would people want to go forward with CPU only at first, or wait for GPU support? FPGA will likely follow, but will pretty certainly not have the same speed or efficiency delta we are seeing now. If they don't follow, it will be because there isn't enough advantage to justify dedicated equipment.

[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> I would say it depends on how confident you are with the new algorithm, @miketout. I wouldn‚Äôt want to rush it if the levels between cpu/gpu/fpga aren‚Äôt what you hope, but I trust you guys can make the right call. IF we go cpu only at start though; I‚Äôd like us to take the opportunity to market the sh*t out of this to attract new miners/investors. Else it‚Äôs just us regulars getting a stab at better profits again, with the same low market volume.

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i definitely would like that before Christmas üòÉ i don't like predicting dates because it won't change anything. there are always unknowns until it's done, and it's more important to get it right. it will be as soon as is reasonably possible. i do think before Christmas.

[11-Dec-18 10:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it's pretty complex this time, as the algo is brand new and focused on a number of strategies to close all easy optimizations for hardware, and many for GPU. we'll need it portable, which is after hand coded is final or in parallel but lagging. we'll need Python for Electrum (anyone up for that üòÉ )?. we'll need Javascript for pools, and we'll need a good miner, which will likely be the nheqminer again unless Chris gets it into his as well.

[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> what I mean if you believe in decentralization because it is permisionless why not include mining in the same thinking, while it's a core part of it

[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> meaning - leave the race for faster devices to the companies and parties wanting to participate in it ?


[12-Dec-18 05:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> if you want to have more wide distribution, maybe time to start thinking as decentrlaizaed profile as the basics? if people/companies got  profiles in the system / recorder somwhere in the core? / it could be easier to distribute mining ? by profiles instead of just devices ?


[12-Dec-18 05:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> it will be interesting experiment and sooner or later there will be distributed profile, working in analogical way google page rank based on links - people will confirm each other to gain trust, but for sure new challenges will arise to discriminate fakes and abusers. Again it will come to the core like devices parts and safety, for example if GPS can be trusted then you could discriminate fakes by location / as long as this cannot be faked, or measured by different parameters too. Or even expect decentralized profiles to interact with reality around, fake profiles (which are based  on thousands of other fake profiles) could have it hard to generate interactions recorded in the network (example someone from the network visiting my office, so I record that event).

[dscrdvrsc] <NWhiskeyTango> I personally don't have an fpga but forking to remove them from the network seems kinda centralizing. Chosing whom to favor, in this case, GPU miners, because they are your biggest supporters? Not sure I understand the whole thought processes behind this @miketout


[12-Dec-18 06:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <NWhiskeyTango> Originally this was supposed to be only CPU minable. Then, by request and acceptance, a GPU miner arose. That's when I stopped mining Verus.  Now there are even bigger hashers then GPUs from what I read and it is decided to fork.


[12-Dec-18 06:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <NWhiskeyTango> Its funny that everyone throws out the word "decentralized" with favoratism to forking to delute fpga hashrate. If that's that's the thought process, fork from GPU algo too. Make it truley decetralized lmao ( forking in no way shape or form is dectrentralized, it's favortism and more centralized then not )


[12-Dec-18 06:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Currently the fpgas that are making up approximately 75% of the hash rate and probably more are causing the centralisation. Also, fpgas are reducing the growth of the community. CPU mining makes verus coin less, not more centralised.


[12-Dec-18 06:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> it's a trade-off


[12-Dec-18 06:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> What is the most important property of a hashing algo? I would say - power efficiency. To equalize power efficiency across all types of mining hw, that's the ultimate goal. And I think Mike&team is doing the best they can, to reach this goal.


[12-Dec-18 06:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> Do not try to be "something-resistant" or "this-hw-only". That is the road to endless loop of forks.

[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> @NWhiskeyTango So the most decentralized is to never change anything ever again once it's launched? :P
Anyway, #announcements explains what the teams considers best. There's nothing strange to it. It's how blockchains work. The work is open source and can be forked to whomever's liking. But for obvious reasons you'd do best in following the development team's fork, and in that case the development team can be considered the centralized part of a project. And lastly, it's not about banning fpga:s, it's about leveling the playing field in this point in time, mostly until fpgas become more common(decentralized). (As I interpret it)

[12-Dec-18 07:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <NWhiskeyTango> @Gloryman i do not disagree that CPU mining would level the playing field. I think you misread read me. What I said was that I, a cpu miner, did not consider fork an option when GPU came into town. But because GPU miners are in abundance and the biggest support group of verus, the squeeky wheel gets the grease.


[12-Dec-18 07:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <NWhiskeyTango> I guess the simplest way to put this is, i didnt bitch and moan when the GPU miner came along. Requesting a fork would very biased. The decision now is GPU biased. Period. It's really that simple. To "level" the playing field between fpga gpu and cpu ultimately = enhancing GPU ability.


[12-Dec-18 08:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @NWhiskeyTango The fork is not against GPU miners. It is just about getting the fork done quicker, instead of waiting for GPU miner's support.


[12-Dec-18 08:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> GPU and CPU were roughly matched, neither side had any 50x perf gain


[12-Dec-18 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> I think , when gpu miners came on board for verus , they/we all did it openly, and we all focused on making the project and community better, when the fpga‚Äôs found a way of mining verus, they chose the opposite route, they did it all secretly, swerving the open community that we had all built up, and then they started to pump and dump , which has had ill effects on not just the price of the verus coin but also the community, i think if they decided to just be open to us all with the fpga miner, yes some of us would have been a bit miffed off that the net hash and difficulty was about to go up , but i think we would have worked through it and added a new lot of members to our community, as it is now , i dont see the fpga crew trying to better the community and the project , i just see them as still being secretive and deceptive towards the community, i totally get your point of view NWhiskeyTango , i think its a shame now with everything thats gone on , we have two separate verus communities, one with cpu and gpu , and the other with fpga‚Äôs , i wish we could go back and try it again a different way , a more open way where we would then have 1 big friendly verus community with fpga‚Äôs and cpu and gpu miners all working together , the proper way , i still have high hopes that some fpga miners will openly join our community and work with us for the future of the project , fingers crossed


[12-Dec-18 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @NWhiskeyTango Yes the goal is decentralization. Not who complains loudest. The issue isnt about stopping anybody and as gloryman said, it is mostly about leveling the playing field and as jl777c said fpga currently have over 50x lead meaning more coins going to a few. This leads to centralization. A group decision is not centralization. If you've been following in here lately, you will find the community is very much united on most of these matters and from the frequent updates and inquiries by Mike and the dev team it leads me to believe that they are flexible and open minded. Who knows, stick around, that cpu might prove useful!


[12-Dec-18 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cryptonoobie> I understand where you guys are coming from.  Not being particularly knowledgeable about the dynamics of mining and all of the different strategies, I don't see how FPGAs could ever be a part of the Verus community.  The goal here is to keep processors of  any type as equitable as possible.  This goes against what the FPGA is supposed to do -- do something extraordinarily fast.  Right?  So with this in mind, I would expect that once the fork comes out, maintain parity between the CPU and GPU as before and lock out the FPGAs enough that there is no incentive to use them anymore.  FPGAs can target other coins.   Or maybe there's something in between where a new algo requires CPU users to get any cheap GPU to use functions that make it impossible for FPGAs?  I don't know, just wondering actually.


[12-Dec-18 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <NWhiskeyTango> Ok I get the secrecy part, that's f'd up. But point on CPU vs GPU, theirs no CPU farms mining verus boys.


[12-Dec-18 08:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <NWhiskeyTango> Maybe your 580 does what my I7 can do or whatever. But your 580 rig, multipliedx lord knows how many of them are out there, blows away the average joe's cpu. There is no equal playing field there either. So yes, make GPU mining verus profitable again.

[12-Dec-18 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Hash per watt, that is the most important metric for a miner seeking returns, no? Hash per watt, I personally have found cpu and gpu quite relative. I still mine with my cpu.


[12-Dec-18 08:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cryptonoobie> @Godballz that makes sense

[12-Dec-18 09:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <NWhiskeyTango> Fact is they decided to change (from cpu only to cpu/gpu). They are deciding to change again and will continue to do so. This I don't support. If your  going to change, then go back to initial intent. Otherwise, your just delaying another change. Countless wasted dev time. Just my 2 cents


[12-Dec-18 09:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Read the white paper again it always stated that asic/fpga would likely happen sooner or later

[12-Dec-18 09:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> If you go back and read all the material and posts from the team you will understand that you are wrong on that statement. Mike always said it was CPU only at start-iup, and that it would take a while before GPU would become viable. He never said GPU would stay out, and he also said that sooner or later any succesfull coin must expect more powerfull centralized hardware to try to gain advantage..

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> "From the very beginning of its operation, Verus operated with a dual proof of stake /
proof of work mechanism for all participants. Verus mining with the VerusHash algorithm,
as of this point, is a CPU-only algorithm, designed with a Haraka512 V2 [30] core to be
quantum secure and to maximize performance on modern CPUs. While VerusHash was
designed to be CPU-optimized and did not begin life with GPU or ASIC miners capable of
beating CPUs in its mining, the Verus developers have no illusions that it is possible someone
might develop either a GPU or ASIC-based miner that could be meaningfully superior to
CPUs."

[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> You state your claim as a fact, but with no proof, and when we explain how it actually is you respond with "meh".
I have been following this project since before launch. I read the available docs before launch. The team has done nothing but overdeliver on their promises so far, and they are staying true to the vision.
I believe you need the history lesson since you can't be bothered to check your facts before you throw criticism at the team.

[12-Dec-18 09:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I was listening to a podcast the other day and, what they said made sense.. That really Vertcoin is getting 51% attacked, bc it was made to resist Asics etc.. It seems like resisting it, puts a target on you.


[12-Dec-18 09:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I agree with  @Cragorn as well. The devs have done nothing but overperform


[12-Dec-18 09:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mining Spec> Just my two cents. Why not look at what Nexus did and make different hashing channels for different types of devices. CPUs have their own hashing channels and then GPUs also have their own hashing channels so they don't have to compete against each other. Of course you can always group the fpgas with the gpus or make third channel.


[12-Dec-18 09:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mining Spec> I'm personally very interested in your project but I'm not able to find all the answers I've been looking for which is a bigger concern to me than the current one you guys are dealing with.

[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> This is your text: "Fact is they decided to change (from cpu only to cpu/gpu)"

[12-Dec-18 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> I dont want you to leave mate. I just want you to understand where you are wrong, and that devs have been very up front and fair since before launch.


[12-Dec-18 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mining Spec> What is the total Supply and when is that Supply expected to be reached?

Half of the reward issued is done through the proof of stake system but is that reward the same as the mining reward? 

As far as I can tell it's just about 25 tokens per mineing block but is it the same for proof of stake?

Do you have to have a certain amount in order to participate in the proof of state if so how much? what would be the expected reward? Are there different tiers or does the amount change over time?


[12-Dec-18 09:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @NWhiskeyTango I would prefer you don't leave too, and I'm sorry to make a judgement about who was being rude. Perhaps I missed something. I'd delete my statement, but I think it's fair to you to leave it, so it might justify your response a bit. I just feel pretty bad when I see that we "decided" to change. We didn't decide to have either GPUs or secret mining FPGAs. The original algorithm stood up well to GPUs, but it was too small in size, had some things that could be optimized significantly on hardware and was simply missing enough barriers to equalize FPGAs. we've learned. I can promise that I never decided to add them, but you could argue that Chris, as a developer, decided to write the GPU miner, and we didn't change the algo for that. Chris did a great job on the GPU miner, and it didn't stop CPU mining altogether. FPGAs were a very different story, and it is time to adjust.


[12-Dec-18 09:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> And it is rather obvious that FPGAs are making Verus centralized when one entity that turned off all minig units to do maintenance resulted in nethash dropped from almost 30TH/s to about 7TH/s for almost a day.

[12-Dec-18 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> accepted as well. I hope you do stick around. can I ask for a summary of your current thinking?


[12-Dec-18 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> Cool mate. No worries. I think most people in here will say you wont be sorry for staying üòÉ


[12-Dec-18 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @NWhiskeyTango stay bro


[12-Dec-18 10:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Hey  @Cragorn. That was only hosted fpgas I believe. I think alot of the 7th hash was also the non-hosted fpgas.


[12-Dec-18 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <NWhiskeyTango> I understand where you all are coming from (the lashing I took lol jk jk). My opinion is truely open minded. My biased vote would be create a "cpu-only algo" as THAT is how I became a Veruser. For this to work, the FPGA secrecy has to go, no doubt. An all-around-hardware algo would be dope. Something like what Mining Spec mentioned?


[12-Dec-18 10:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <NWhiskeyTango> I understand the changes that happened I just hope you all here kinda see in between the lines of where I, personally, was at then. That I couldn't keep up with the changes at the time as a CPU miner ( maybe a little sad about that GPU miner, maybe. Just a personal perspective)


[12-Dec-18 10:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I understand your point, I started cpu only as well. It's been very interesting watching this project grow though to say the least and it looks to only get better.


[12-Dec-18 10:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the new Algo will likely be CPU only at first, was designed to leverage every strength of CPUs, especially where they are weaknesses of hardware, and is expected to bring GPUs much closer to CPUs, as Chris doesn't think they will yet be slower. We've closed every known hole for algo-specific optimization of hardware. Short of testing on an FPGA, we are optimistic as is reasonable, and rather than take some additional steps to cut them off, which will make things worse, IMO, when they come back, we believe the new algo has a very good chance of making them a non issue and reinvigorating CPU mining. Since we don't yet have GPU or FPGA, we can only go by opinions of experts we know. On FPGA, due to the money involved, only an actual implementation optimized by someone really good will give us the final answer.


[12-Dec-18 10:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <NWhiskeyTango> Yes i agree. I try to keep up. Crypto Rich interviews and frequent discord visits.


[12-Dec-18 10:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> @Gloryman Yea, that might be, but I can't say for sure. Also, the point was that this puts close to 23TH/s on one entity. The other FPGAs could be more decentralized if they are on private hands.


[12-Dec-18 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Cragorn agreed


[12-Dec-18 10:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @miketout did u think anymore about that option to work with that fpga manufacturer?


[12-Dec-18 10:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> The $500 one.


[12-Dec-18 10:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> when I say "likely CPU only", I actually do hope that Chris finishes the GPU miner, and I think it will be a challenge to beat CPUs if it is possible. as far as net hash, I am quite sure we will go back to numbers from the earlier days (still with the 51% attack immunity of VerusPoP). The new algo, if it ends up being final, is significantly slower on CPUs as well because it's just doing more. We'll get more benchmarks on different CPUs before I put out numbers, as it should advantage the newest CPUs over older ones as well, which is our strategy to defend against bot-nets.


[12-Dec-18 10:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> As long as it works ok with my threadripper üòâ


[12-Dec-18 10:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> üòÇ


[12-Dec-18 10:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Gloryman I would like to, as I'd rather have it done in the open. Right now, we're just waiting on the algo release, as then we can get more opinions of FPGA experts and devs on whether they'd even like to try in the near future.


[12-Dec-18 10:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Threadrippers should be quite good. I think the newest Intel's may be fastest.


[12-Dec-18 10:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Wow 8 core can beat 16 core. What about 32 core? Will that be ok/fast?


[12-Dec-18 10:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <NWhiskeyTango> *side note* realizing now in my ramblings that I said something on the lines of -benefiting the devs- relating to if/when deciding to make changes was way out of line. My sppologies. Let it be known.


[12-Dec-18 10:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <NWhiskeyTango> It was not my intent


[12-Dec-18 10:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> @Mining Spec Check out the spreadsheet in #faq-chosen  #23. Download to edit the current blockheight and your amount of coins staking. It should help you get some answers.


[12-Dec-18 11:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <penguin> Is there an ETA for the algo change ?


[12-Dec-18 07:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mining Spec> @Cragorn  Thx


[12-Dec-18 09:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Skillachie> CPU


[12-Dec-18 09:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Skillachie> > as it should advantage the newest CPUs over older ones as well, which is our strategy to defend against bot-nets.


[12-Dec-18 09:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Skillachie> This is only a temporary strategy since eventually more computers will have newer cpus. Would be nice to have decent performance on old CPUs. I have old CPUs üòÉ but I understand. Still vote CPU

[12-Dec-18 11:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <JT> thanks for repeating the question.. I'd *prefer* a GPU miner (since I have a 1080Ti on my main box, and rig with 5 1070 and 2 1060 cards that I want to mine with) but I'd be willing to just run the CPU one initially if that was available.


[13-Dec-18 12:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <NWhiskeyTango> I would like to post a response on friday if that is ok? Currently leaning towards CPU only. "Uncertain" is fine for the time being too


[13-Dec-18 12:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> CPU only for me üéÖ Delivering a positive change as fast as possible is more important than my own benefit (I am mostly GPU mining)üôÉ


[13-Dec-18 12:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <idrtis> by cpu only, do we mean potentialy inefficient gpu miner (with the current information) and financially infeasible special products fgpa asic etc ?


[13-Dec-18 12:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @ok88 agreed. I have mainly gpus. But, I want this project to get back to a normal growing project. Not just hanging around waiting for something to be done about fpgas.


[13-Dec-18 12:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ted> i really very like you@ok88 hhhhhha


[13-Dec-18 12:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> @John Westbrook I'd feel comfortable with 'CPU First'. I also want to express once more in general that if we go cpu first, or even with gpu ready, I hope we can all take the opportunity to market and attract new miners instead of us regulars just taking profits from lower difficulty.


[13-Dec-18 12:56 AM] Gateway#3763

[13-Dec-18 01:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @ted Approach should be good for the community, not myself, thats all. I have VRSC so I want the project to be successful, not my mining... üëç


[13-Dec-18 02:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <evilwar> I say kill the fpgas asap. Secretly mining is not in the interests of the project.


[13-Dec-18 04:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jbates58> So, will the new algo need a new CPU miner written for it?


[13-Dec-18 04:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @John Westbrook Just noticed I'm on the uncertain list. I mine with both CPU and GPU but I am totally up for CPU only if it will bring balance sooner. If it can still be tweaked and there's no compromise for timeliness, I don't see a problem with a fresh start. The rest should fall in place naturally


[13-Dec-18 05:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Daiyox> @John Westbrook I'd fall into the CPU first category as well.. When Verus launched I found it very refreshing to see a project with CPU centric beginnings


[13-Dec-18 05:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Prague> @John Westbrook I still think that we should be CPU + GPU balanced, with CPU advantage. 1 good CPU (i.e. Ryzen) = 6 good GPUs (i.e. 1070-1080)


[13-Dec-18 06:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cryptonoobie> I vote CPU but agree with the equal hash rate/power argument.


[13-Dec-18 07:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto Baggins> My POV is, dont hate the player, hate the game. Let's not change the game because someone figured out how to play better.


[13-Dec-18 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Hey @miketout, I was wondering if we could have some information about security and protecting our wallets and crypto on exchanges. How to prevent hacking and code practice for protecting Verus or any other cryptocurrency. Perhaps we could have a channel @aelder to share hacking attempts, scams, security flaws in other coins or security ideas/advice. We just call the channel 'security'. What do you think?


[13-Dec-18 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cryptonoobie> I totally get your point @Crypto Baggins but I feel like FPGAs can spoil the game for the other coins.  This one has a different intention than other PoW coins so I‚Äôd love to see the spirit preserved and see how the strategy works over time.


[13-Dec-18 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @jbates58 You probably have the biggest stake i have seen. Could you contribute to security advice for the Verus community please?


[13-Dec-18 09:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto Baggins> @cryptonoobie the arguement to me seems very playground. Johnny has nicer toys, now Johnny cant play with us. ASICs, FPGAs, stacks of GPUs, 10 CPUs if there's a way to grab more hash someone will do it. Changing the game just prolongs the inevitable IMO.


[13-Dec-18 09:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> unless technically the hashrate/watt for the different hardware can be made close


[13-Dec-18 09:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> why not wait for release according to announcement?


[13-Dec-18 09:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> until then it is all speculation on the outcome of the new algo


[13-Dec-18 09:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <idrtis> things always change in order to make the situation better. instead of arguing about why changing you should present the advantages of being fgpa friendly over spending energy to be more equalitarian @Crypto Baggins

[13-Dec-18 10:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> If anyone is considering using the AAcoin staking feature, I would be very cautious. AAcoin is a very new exchange, and very little information is available about it(At least in English). English support is basically non-existent. I recently made a bitcoin withdrawal from the site, and it took about two hours for it to process beyond "pending review" of course there is no information on what that means. 

That coupled with the fake trading activity on the site means I will be staying away.


[13-Dec-18 10:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> The twitter account they link to from their site doesn't even exist, and their about page is complete nonsense and gibberish.


[13-Dec-18 10:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> What I would like to know if there is any realistic possibility of supporting staking with a hardware wallet. I know some POS ERC20 tokens it is possible, but understand it's completely different.


[13-Dec-18 10:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cryptonoobie> @Patrick ManBearPig thank you for the heads-up


[13-Dec-18 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I think it would be good to set up a 1 vrsc account to get the lifetime staking fee if we change our mind.


[13-Dec-18 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Fyi some of our community members are presently holding some significant VRSC on the exchange and we definitely would not have given AAcoin a shout out if we felt at all uncomfortable with their comm or actions.  They are very new yes, and keeping your coins on any exchange is always a risk.  As for the slow withdrawals, I also experienced this and it‚Äôs unclear why they take a long time to approve withdrawals.  Bottom line, always proceed with caution when dealing with a third party...we haven‚Äôt seen any significant reason to distrust these guys more than any exchange however.


[13-Dec-18 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cryptonoobie> @Gloryman good point


[13-Dec-18 11:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Have you seen any reason to trust them more than any other exchange?


[13-Dec-18 11:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Nope, personally I treat all exchanges exactly the same unless I see some reason not to use one altogether.


[13-Dec-18 11:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> They claim to be a team of people from large Chinese companies, but provide no details. Could be former mailroom clerks for all we know. I trade on some really sketchy exchanges, and this one sets off alarm bells.


[13-Dec-18 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> At the least they could put the effort into hiring a competent proofreader to clean up the translation, and also making sure their links all work. That's just amateur.


[13-Dec-18 11:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <runningwithbeer> AACoin looks shady to me. But I realize I might have some bias against chinese crypto anything. Long story...  I hope they are on the up and up. But I'm staying out...


[13-Dec-18 11:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> All I know is that they seemed interested in the project from the time they contacted us. They don't seem to be doing that for all projects, which you might expect if they were more of a scam, and they are the first exchange or pool to build automated staking support. We don't know them more than working with them here, but they seem technically capable, and based on their interest, they integrated and listed Verus for free before even asking for the 25K, which was earmarked for promotion. The trading bot was interesting. They acknowledged it, explained it, and they have turned it off in response to the Verus community. I hope they are trustworthy as they seem when communicating, and it would be great if we could have the ability to know. Lifetime 1% staking fee is a reason to at least register, IMO.


[13-Dec-18 12:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Not saying they are a scam. Just sharing personal experience and observations. In my unprofessional opinion, people should tread carefully.


[13-Dec-18 12:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Still wondering about the possibility of hardware wallet staking at some point in the future


[13-Dec-18 12:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> You should always be concerned with how you keep your cryptocurrency. You're responsible, being your own bank and all. You have every reason to be careful. I wouldn't go so far to call everything unreliable to be scam though. I'm too cautious and  wouldn't dare to take the risk in my own current situation, but my understanding is that there are gamblers out here/there that would throw themselves at these kind of things. And AACoin are great for making it available either way, just be careful to engage if that's not your thing.


[13-Dec-18 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jbates58> Ginasismining pools has been offering pooled staking for over a month now.

I nearly choked when I saw the aacoin announcement, 20% fee after the grace period.... lol, wtf.

At ginasis mining it's a 1%fee if you mine on our pool, or 2% of you don't. So just a casual 20x / 10x lower....

We have been doing g it long enough to get a decent rep aswell, with many members with plenty of verus in the kitty.


@Gloryman I have nfi about coding, so would be useless for the security thing. Haha. But thanks for the kind words.


[13-Dec-18 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <basti> Anyway it is a service. Other exchanges do not offer that. Do their wallets not staking too? Is good if you are a daytrader and get a small bonus!


[13-Dec-18 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> 20% would be around $15 a month at today's rates if you stake 1 block a day


[13-Dec-18 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @basti staking just happens automatically on your Verus wallet on the exchange while it has a balance.


[13-Dec-18 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @John Westbrook Is the 1% fee on the first amount or the all amounts we put on there in future?


[13-Dec-18 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Kind of cool, even if you‚Äôre going to do a single trade, you could potentially cover your trading fees and maybe then some


[13-Dec-18 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> They agreed to offer 1% forever once you get going.


[13-Dec-18 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> well if you do your first before jan 31 that is


[13-Dec-18 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> So, if I put some coins in there in 2020, they  will be staked?


[13-Dec-18 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> at 1%


[13-Dec-18 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> if you did some today, then withdrew, then did some later in 2020, yes


[13-Dec-18 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> that‚Äôs the offer they are making

[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> On a side note, Ginasis Mining Pools offer pooled staking. Be it isnt automated and must be in multiples of 100 to keep the math simple for a peasant like myself. All addresses are provided so there is full transparency of earnings.  The fees are on 1%-2% ATM. There is now a small handfull of active members involved that should be able to confirm our service. üòÉ

[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> That work for you?

[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @That_Guy8  No. Can you DM me it


[14-Dec-18 01:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <oscar> @miketout much voice about the next algo is good for cpu or gpu,but I think we should have both,in the past times ,we can see there is alot miners use Nvida,we can't leave them away,so the problem is the new algo is for nvidia or amd,I prefer Nvida,becuase that card almost everyone have


[14-Dec-18 01:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <oscar> gpu farms and cpu farms we can know alot ,so next is how strong your device is


[14-Dec-18 01:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <oscar> then how many coins you can get ,that is good for every miners


[14-Dec-18 02:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Earlier today I was thinking the opposite. ^^ NVIDIA users got the first available gpu miner on the current algo. I was hoping @Chris - LOUD Mining Dev-Ops would try to give AMD some margins this time around. ;D But jokes aside, there shouldn't be any need to worry, equal opportunity should be about the same whether or not it's just cpu or both cpu and gpu available.


[14-Dec-18 02:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - LOUD Mining Dev-Ops> the AMD miner runs fine on nvidia... so there is the possibility that we can release the AMD first, but hopefully release them together will be best


[14-Dec-18 02:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> AMD first is best because I own them. üòÇ üòâ


[14-Dec-18 02:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Shocking


[14-Dec-18 05:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> I vote for equal hash rate/power


[14-Dec-18 05:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <kryptoshi> CPU only


[14-Dec-18 07:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <plazma> cpu


[14-Dec-18 11:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> @miketout . I'm not asking when the new algo is exactly, but in more general terms, what's your target timeframe. Days, weeks or months? in 2018 or 2019 .. etc?


[14-Dec-18 11:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Gmoney it is likely final right now and working great üòÉ we are working on an announcement for significant GPU and FPGA bounties for devs who can make an open implementation that can beat CPUs. Release should be in the next 1-3 days, I believe. It is much more comprehensively designed for CPU advantage than VerusHash 1.0, which was relying only on the Haraka core for that purpose.


[14-Dec-18 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <basti> @miketout solo mine?


[14-Dec-18 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @basti i plan to update the nheqminer for pool mining before activation. we are working on a number of things for support.


[14-Dec-18 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @miketout Great job for sorting this FPGA issue out quickly. I'm so excited about this new fork.


[14-Dec-18 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> thanks @Gloryman üòÉ me too


[14-Dec-18 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> The cpu miner will come out shortly after the fork right?


[14-Dec-18 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> No specific date. I will make every effort to have it out before activation, so pools should be fine.


[14-Dec-18 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Oh sweet. So we put the miner on and it works only when verus is activated or it mines the verus1.0 too?


[14-Dec-18 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <kryptoshi> Yes baby!


[14-Dec-18 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <kryptoshi> CPU. Love it

[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> amazing


[14-Dec-18 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <technopato> @miketout any adverse affect for staking with current version 4.0h wallets?
Edit: I mean after the fork to verushash 2.0, or will a new wallet be required also?


[14-Dec-18 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Due to a fork I‚Äôd imagine all new wallets are going to be required @technopato


[14-Dec-18 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ph03nix> @miketout thank you for your amazing contribution to the komodo ecosystem, re:sapling


[14-Dec-18 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <technopato> @Ginasis Mining Pools thanks.. how about staking? Is this affected?


[14-Dec-18 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Gloryman There will be either a new nheqminer or ccminer, or both that should be able to mine through along with the wallet for solo-mining, and new pool software to support the new block version and hash. It's likely that there will no longer be much of a speed difference between nheqminer, the wallet, and ccminer on CPUs with VerusHash 2.0, but Chris will almost certainly keep the optimizations that are there now and still apply in the final step, so if there is a ccminer option, it should have at least a little more hash power.
@technopato all wallets will need to be upgraded to be able to process the new hash for the blocks on the chain. staking functionality will not change at all.
@Godballz @ph03nix and all thank you üòÉ


[14-Dec-18 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <technopato> @miketout thanks much for the clarity!

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Thank you @grewalsatinder , and congratulations to Komodo for activating the upgrade across all projects (I think) across the whole Komodo ecosystem!


[14-Dec-18 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> actually 2 projects on exchanges, decided to delay updating, so this wasnt a forced hardfork across the ecosystem. any project could have opted out. they run the latest code, just without sapling activation, which is backward compatible with the non-updated daemons


[14-Dec-18 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763

[14-Dec-18 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> And stake


[14-Dec-18 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> those changes are not yet, it is "only" the sapling hardfork for now

[dscrdvrsc] <66tbird> What is the actual Aacion staking reward?  Just wondering what to expect.


[15-Dec-18 09:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @66tbird it is a % of your stake compared to the total aacoin pool and rewards being won by that pool...minus 1% fee on reward payouts


[15-Dec-18 09:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bassliner> what wallet is needed to support the fork ?


[15-Dec-18 09:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bassliner> im running 0.4.0a-beta do i need to change ?


[15-Dec-18 09:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bassliner> and if so do i just delete the old agama directory in %appdata% and run new wallet and paste wallet.dat


[15-Dec-18 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bassliner> its OK done it and worked fine

[15-Dec-18 09:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @bassliner the release for the fork is not out yet. we are in final testing for release today, but the upgrade process will be the same. We will announce when the fork update is posted.


[15-Dec-18 09:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @ver_User the newest Verus-enhanced Agama upgrade that we are testing today for release will include both the new hash algorithm as well as support for (edit: I‚Äôve been informed that I made a mistake, and it is MOST) other Komodo ecosystem coins.


[15-Dec-18 09:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> ok thanks for clarifying


[15-Dec-18 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Also, as we have enabled a multi-daemon wallet, we should have no compatibility issues with other Komodo coins going forward. We will need to add them as new ones start in the ecosystem.


[15-Dec-18 10:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bassliner> @miketout  $ARRR support also

[15-Dec-18 09:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Since I implied the release may happen today in this channel, an update... we are still working on release testing. No issues yet, but some testing has been slow across platforms and with this change, we want to be sure. We expect the release this weekend. Activation is still expected for Sunday the 23rd.


[15-Dec-18 10:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jonske1> Just saw your messages... so releasing today but not swapping until the 23rd?


[15-Dec-18 10:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> not releasing until we finish all tests. there will be a couple improvements that I'm working to slip in as the tests are in progress, and we're considering adding the portable version if it's done tomorrow. right now, shooting for release this weekend


[15-Dec-18 10:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> activation still targeting the 23rd


[15-Dec-18 10:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jonske1> Awesome. Love your work.


[15-Dec-18 11:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Hey @miketout . I'm a bit confused. What is the difference between release and activation?


[16-Dec-18 12:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @Gloryman release is so everyone can have the appropriate software for when the changes are activated


[16-Dec-18 12:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Ginasis Mining Pools thanks


[16-Dec-18 02:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jonske1> Is there a decision on whether it will be cpu only at first or likely there will be a GPU miner straight from the start? Pools likely to be ready or solo?


[16-Dec-18 02:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @jonske1 I think it was mentioned that we should have pools ready and GPU may be ready on day 1


[16-Dec-18 02:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> but probs not a optimized miner just an initial release id imagine


[16-Dec-18 02:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> as goes for the CPU too, would probs be room for improvement down the track


[16-Dec-18 02:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jonske1> Cool. No change since I last stopped by. Cheers.


[16-Dec-18 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> So, when the software is released, we go on to the new software and it will work. Then when it is activated, the old software wont work for mining, right?


[16-Dec-18 03:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Just woke up me, didnt read everything and got a bit ahead of myself, i though it was getting activated today but i see its 23rd. Activation üòÅ


[16-Dec-18 03:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Will the old boot strap still work on the new fork , i assume we will all need to do a full blockchain resync with the new software release ?


[16-Dec-18 03:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Generally we should not need to resync the full chain for a fork


[16-Dec-18 03:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Oh , even better , üëçüèº thanks @Ginasis Mining Pools


[16-Dec-18 03:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @Gloryman sound about right


[17-Dec-18 06:09 AM] Gateway#3763

[17-Dec-18 07:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <LocoMB> will VERUS wallet diverge from Agama wallet? latest Agama is 0.3.somethin and VERUS reads 0.4


[17-Dec-18 12:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <runningwithbeer> @miketout if you need any help testing, I volunteer. I have about 80 CPUs


[17-Dec-18 12:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I can test threadripper if you need too


[17-Dec-18 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @LocoMB they diverged a long time ago, and we have been working to keep them generally in sync


[17-Dec-18 12:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we have had coinbase shielding, zero knowledge messaging along with private transactions and display of private transactions as well as other things for a while


[17-Dec-18 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> in this release, we have added the ability to have multiple daemons, so we can support all coins that will be supported in Komodo or other daemons as well, natively


[17-Dec-18 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Zak> i applied a new exchange listing as a member of the community and i hope they will consider my application to list Veruscoin. If you wonder it is Mandala exchange


[17-Dec-18 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Zak> They support projects that didn't conduct any ico and list without a fee


[17-Dec-18 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> cool @Zak !


[17-Dec-18 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <runningwithbeer> Can someone tell me again what it's going to take to get on CMC and a 'major' exchange?


[17-Dec-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <runningwithbeer> money? Volume?


[17-Dec-18 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @Zak how about I create an announcement for this, to follow our usual form of first asking the community for their thoughts and feedback on any exchange we apply to?  I love the initiative you took on this, and of course any exchange is able to list us of their own volition, but when we apply it does translate more into a community decision combined with work on our part to get listed.


[17-Dec-18 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @runningwithbeer by "major" exchange do you mean by a measure of adoption/use combined with volume?


[17-Dec-18 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <runningwithbeer> yes sir


[17-Dec-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> It often does take a large fee if they are not choosing to list, combined with an application process which often involves some legal verfication of various aspects including the utility classification of a token


[17-Dec-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> trading volume on DP has dropped off below it's already normally low amount


[17-Dec-18 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Other times it is simply something the exchange chooses to do however, especially in the case of a project's market sentiment, popularity, and other similar factors


[17-Dec-18 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> So much for the fpgas will keep the price low argument


[17-Dec-18 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @Patrick ManBearPig I'm guessing this is in large part to the lower trading activity of fpga miners. I know from their channels there has been some small talk of holding/staking for now


[17-Dec-18 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Just a guess, also I'm sure there are a host of other reasons market-wide


[17-Dec-18 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Nobody buying either though


[17-Dec-18 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Smallest spread I've seen on DP since I found out about Verus

[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> ü§∑


[17-Dec-18 02:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <runningwithbeer> So what can we each do, as community members to support VRSC, besides mining and staking? There has to be something more.


[17-Dec-18 02:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> I guess that makes it a good time to buy üòÉ


[17-Dec-18 02:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I would but I am broke and the bear ate my lunch

[17-Dec-18 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Especially with this fork, it's going to be really helpful for lots of community members to help make some noise about the latest algo, what makes it important, etc.

[dscrdvrsc] <runningwithbeer> seriously though. A weekly tweet that we can retweet would be a good start, as is upvoting reddit comments. I think we can use the new protocol as a good topic

[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> Verus Vednesdays ;)

Truth Coin Tuesdays


[18-Dec-18 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> @Patrick ManBearPig this should be indicative of a larger move coming, bias is on up IMO. 

Sellers stop selling, buyers trying to get filled quietly, price creeps up a little, then as the move speeds up we can call it a break out and chasing price occurs. 

BTC bounce is good news for this


[18-Dec-18 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @ver_User completely agree. This is the solid floor forming because of the announcement of verushash 2.0. Now FPGA miners want to mine and not dump.


[18-Dec-18 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> @John Westbrook how much do we actually think FGPA miners have the potential to impact price beyond normal miners? I just see them as miners same as any... anyone who has a lot of hardware, can mine a lot. If someone considers themselves a miner, they will likely sell over hold, whether they have an FGPA or not. 

Why do we think these FGPA miners are supposed to be such a negative influence on price, over and above any other miner? Just because it was secret? Do/did they have the capability to control that much of the coin supply?


[18-Dec-18 03:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> FGPA miners are largely ROI chasers. GPU and CPU miners usually mine in projects they like and are more likely to hold. This is based on what i heard in their discord. Also, price dropped 66% over the course of FPGA miners taking off.


[18-Dec-18 04:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ver_User> OK, but many altbtc pairs have dropped significantly recently too. KMDBTC from 25th Oct - Nov dropped 40%

If market conditions were such that price was rising, I suspect that FGPA miners would be selling less and we could attribute less significance to their effects on price. Market moves influence behaviour as much as behaviour influences market moves IMO.

[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> "blah blah blah blah üí© " - Gloryman


[18-Dec-18 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @ver_User yeah, that's a good point. The entire price drop can't be 100% attributed to fpgas. But what we do know is that they are 1. Dumping the coin based on their discord channel. 2. They stopped new people from mining the coin with gpu and cpu by pricing them out. 3. They had at least 75% of the hash rate. 4. They were discussing the prospects of a pump and dump. To what degree these affect short term price is difficult to tell but i sold my coins at this news and the price went down. Then i bought some again. The price has been steadily increasing since the news of the fork. And the fork gives fpgas miners less influence over pump and dump opportunites going forward.


[18-Dec-18 12:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Post> i wonder if the price goes to down after the fork, what the reason might than be...those bad fpga miners üòÑ


[18-Dec-18 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cryptonoobie> only time will tell


[18-Dec-18 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cryptonoobie> I predict that the price will go up, because I have a crystal ball that says so


[18-Dec-18 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Post FPGA miners aren't bad, but just not best for the project at this stage in time. simple as

[18-Dec-18 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Grenwolde> @Gloryman that is the biggest crock of horsecrap I have read in a while -- most of the FPGA miners also have gpu and cpu rigs -- they tend to be innovators at this stage and go forbid they also have  ASICS.  Their motivations are likely as broad as the rest of the motivations of this group.  However they tend to be willing to experiment with new technology .  I don't mine for altruistic reasons , I would generalise and say that of 90 plus percent of the people who mine this coin.  We support project, we buy and sell and a large number of us stake as well.  The reason that people are likely mining and selling verus is the concern about the direction of the project.  You are concerned about the minig power of the FPGA -- but in no way limit large GPU or even CPU farms -- one guy on her was bragging about the size of their farm.  As size that most of us small to medium sized miners can't comprehend -- hundreds of thousands of dollars in equipment -- but not cutting edge.  Guess there is the difference.


[18-Dec-18 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Grenwolde you have not described our approach accurately. The approach is a goal of equalization, as there was secret mining by a small number of people intended to make a lot of money sniping coins. This is simply not good for the community or project. Why people are selling? Maybe Christmas, but we are still working on the vision, in spite of this detour to more decentralize PoW opportunities. We are soon going to release a new algo, and it will hopefully make it easier and better for many people to mine and coexist in the long run, even if/when FPGA devs can follow. Perhaps you noticed the FPGA and GPU bounties as well. When FPGAs do come again, maybe it won't be as unequally matched and used to provide a small number of secret miners an advantage over everyone else, which is an unsustainable approach anyways, but as a way to serve the entire community of miners who might be interested.


[18-Dec-18 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Could we at least agree that drawing broad conclusions based on 1 wick on 1 day of low volume trading on a low volume exchange is dishonest?


[18-Dec-18 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Much conjecture, little evidence.


[18-Dec-18 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Honestly, it smells a little of an attempt at laying FUD roots :/


[18-Dec-18 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> He has been repeatedly informed by multiple people of the many reasons why his conclusions are unsupported, but he continues to repeat them as gospel


[18-Dec-18 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> It's somewhat disturbing to see someone like this capitalize so much of the conversation lately.


[18-Dec-18 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> When the conversation is between members who are also members of the same FPGA discord, it makes a little more sense.


[18-Dec-18 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Gloryman  This guy flip-flops more than a politician. He's trying to be everyone's friend & I don't believe he is being entirely truthful. This isn't something I'd usually do, bc it's not fair to single people out. However, I think if you are playing both sides of the fence as he does, then you become fair game for criticism. It's definitely not personal. Just state your honest opinion, like most everyone else, and let the conversation play out.

[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Cruz lol, when i say FPGA miners are not evil but they at this time they damage the project you say I'm playing both sides. Then when mike says they are coin sniping but wants to work with them to equalise then its 'great work'. This is practically the same opinion. üòÇ


[18-Dec-18 11:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> No, he says you are playing both sides because just like everyone else he knows you are in the fpga group ingratiating yourself. Practically begging for discounts, saying you want one, etc. Meanwhile you are in here fudding it up.


[18-Dec-18 11:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Same reason why people in the FPGA group have outright called you a hypocrite(Their words, not mine)

[19-Dec-18 01:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Gloryman No, its practically not the same opinion. As a lead dev of a crypto, he understands that change is inevitable. And he is consistent, with his words.
You are in both discords, telling each person they are the greatest in the world. This FPGA conversation, for the Verus project, has been really the first serious issue for the community & the project to encounter together. To be fair to everyone else, bc they have an opinion to voice to, you should state your honest opinion & then chime in, when it's suitable.  Not try to seek attention, here or there.


[19-Dec-18 01:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I'm not questioning you being a part of the community or having an opinion, as important as the next persons. I'm only saying to be honest & to be consistent, in what you say. I've been to the FPGA discord. I even checked out all the prices & the results. Why? For general knowledge, I was curious.


[19-Dec-18 01:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I have never changed my opinion for 4 months on fpga mining.

[19-Dec-18 01:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> People have commented on you being on both sides, this entire FPGA discussion. Weeks probably


[19-Dec-18 01:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I have been on both discords expressing the same opinion. They say I am trolling to help you guys out and you say I'm causing fud and trying to be on the side of fpga miners. Its hysteria. None of you can show me a expressing two opposing views


[19-Dec-18 01:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Its mass hysteria. There is not a single quite showing me saying something contradictory.


[19-Dec-18 01:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> You just said it. It's not mass hysteria. It's obviously your actions

[19-Dec-18 01:21 AM] Gateway#3763

[19-Dec-18 01:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> The tone in this discord has changed drastically since the fpga announcement, and considering every time I come on here(which is far less frequently now) it's full of misinformation from the same person posting more than anyone else. Sold out asap, but somehow keeps making demands. Spreading FUD. It's old. It's tiresome.


[19-Dec-18 01:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> FGPA miners are largely ROI chasers. GPU and CPU miners usually mine in projects they like and are more likely to hold. This is based on what i heard in their discord. Also, price dropped 66% over the course of FPGA miners taking off.
@Honey I cant afford one this soon buddy, but let me know when there is another promotion.

[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Cruz lol, people talk about a lot of different mining developments on this discord. One of the miner developers for Verus was talking about FPGAs because it is relevant to the VERUS project.

[19-Dec-18 01:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> You keep dropping names, but have you contributed anything? Serious question.


[19-Dec-18 01:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Lol the difference between me and Mike, is a difference I wish not to look into ....


[19-Dec-18 01:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Cruz I dont understand.


[19-Dec-18 01:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Cruz lol, when i say FPGA miners are not evil but they at this time they damage the project you say I'm playing both sides. Then when mike says they are coin sniping but wants to work with them to equalise then its 'great work'. This is practically the same opinion. joy


[19-Dec-18 01:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> whats wrong with that?


[19-Dec-18 01:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Mike can say freely what he wants to. He has good reasoning. Why compare yourself to Mike? lol

@ver_User been working non-stop for the past few days on a Windows, MingW64 bug (the build environment) that affects mining in Windows and I am working on working around right now. As of yesterday, we know that it cannot be trivially worked around, and I will do whatever I need to today, so we can get it out.

[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> When is the new algo being implemented? I had heard Sunday but curious if that is still on track. Thanks


[20-Dec-18 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we are planning to fork on block 310000, which is Dec 28th. releases are being prepared today.


[20-Dec-18 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> new algo has been implemented for a little while now. we have been tracking down and then working around a thread local storage bug in MingW/gcc compiler for the windows build. the first release includes portable support as well, since that was done as we were looking for the windows issue.


[20-Dec-18 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <VirtualSoundNW> Always best to fork on a fixed block height for this sort of thing so everybody has a weeklong window to get upgraded.

[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> What happens if one doesnt download the latest version of the Agama wallet from veruscoin.io prior to the 28th? Wld I lose all Verus in my wallet currently?


[20-Dec-18 09:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @jintaa no. you can upgrade later, but you will miss out on the fork and its new CPU mining. i your wallet is running and staking, you will likely go onto a fork and require a chain resync when you do upgrade, but you will not lose your coins.


[20-Dec-18 09:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Ok, great; thanks for the response, @miketout


[21-Dec-18 12:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Great job on getting the new Verus wallet out and the merging of the other Komodo coins. My Pirate suddenly has an R-address when it didn't before and I am now able to switch to sapling; It was something I knew I needed to do, nagging at my subconscious. It's a good feeling when an update goes well, but to unexpectedly have some other thing updated as a result is a new and pleasant surprise. Thanks for that and everything else you all do @VerusTeam! Looking forward to the fork.

[dscrdvrsc] <bassliner> all i did to install was deleted OLD agama directory in %appdat% delete OLD wallet and run new one having pasted the wallet.dat file  is this enough will i be on the new chain ??

[21-Dec-18 08:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @bassliner you should be fine. deleting the agama directory shouldn't hurt, but it isn't necessary. just do make sure you backup your wallet.dat, just to be sure, but it doesn't seem you have more to do.

Cryptocurrency CPU Mining Makes a Comeback in Late 2018 - NullTX
In the world of cryptocurrency mining, plenty of changes have occurred throughout the years. Whereas CPU mining once was people‚Äôs only option to generate Bitcoin, things have taken a few interesting twists and turns over the years. To date, CPU mining is pretty much unfavor...

[dscrdvrsc] <idrtis> Hey people I remmeber(?) some people were talking about disabling sprout addresses. Is there potentially a way to lose our funds that way?


[22-Dec-18 10:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Verus Coin is not doing that. I believe Sprout addresses will be disabled on Komodo and Komodo asset chains that run on the Komodo daemon sometime after Feb 15th, but you will need to discuss details with them. I know that Komodo is working to make it easy for everyone to transfer funds. Verus Coin has no schedule or plan to disable Sprout addresses at this time.

[dscrdvrsc] <CREATOR> So there is a fork to get rid of FPGAs and a bounty to for FPGA implementation. Makes sense..... NOT !


[22-Dec-18 11:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> thanks for your thoughts. there is a fork to make hardware returns more equitable across types, and a bounty to ensure that the new tech in the algorithm is tested on FPGAs in the open and implementations shared


[23-Dec-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @CREATOR I think your assumption is not right. The fork is here to introduce new hash algo that will lower FPGAs potential, so that we do not fail the current stage of the network's growth that we are in. We want FPGAs but not with hashrates that exclude any other form of mining from incentives to mine, as we are very early in terms of the network expansion and want as many miners as possible on the chain so everyone can join our community, mine and benefit the vision. The incentive for FPGAs developers is here to challenge the current algorithm, so that we may verify the current hashing algorithm resistance to FPGAs and further improve the algorithm if necessary or create a dedicated hardware solution that will be effective, open-source and available for everyone that want to secure the network. Its all about fairness, openness and creating a community driven environment that embraces the project. Current FPGAs are not doing any good for the community and their distributor and developers are not willing to be a part of the community and adapt to its ideas. The steps that Verus developers have taken were discussed openly with the community and decisions made reflect the community's way of thinking. So, just to sum it up - if you believe it all makes no sense, you are just questioning collective decisions made with a feedback from all of our community members - a bit late for that, but still great to hear that you have a different opinion on this, like some of us (minority) did. Its appreciated ‚úå


[23-Dec-18 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Well put  @ok88. Couldn't have said it better.@CREATOR Many of us believe in and have openly voiced our concerns and opinions on this matter at great length, and through these discussions, as a community, we collectively concluded that this is the best possible solution for the long term benefit of the project. A move that should aim balance things rather than resist progress. "Don't get set into one form, adapt it and build your own, and let it¬†grow, be like¬†water." - the late great Bruce Lee
Forget "asic resistance", what this new algorithm symbolizes is more akin to the dawning of the age of hardware homogeny. Who knows, Verushash 2.0 may lead by example and set a new industry standard.


[23-Dec-18 04:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> In that sense, this situation may prove to be a unique opportunity rather than a death knell. For the developers to take something that many would consider problematic and turn it into a positive change, only stands to highlight their ingenuity and resolve. How many projects have forked away from asics out of fear only to deal with them again later on down the line? How many projects fork, learn, adapt, and then welcome asics back, rising to the challenge? This is exactly what sets Verus apart. These are the things that got us here, aren't they? I, for one, am excited to see how this fork goes and have a very good feeling about this approach.


[23-Dec-18 04:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> He is just a troll from the FPGA discord forum guys.


[23-Dec-18 04:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> It's ok. Might as well try to get people to see other sides in hope they may come around. There are many angles and I can understand where some might lose sight of what is best long term rather than chasing instant returns into the ground. When Verus grows and the price goes up, then those same fpga guys may find themselves happily coming back here to mine Verushash 2.0 even at reduced fpga hashrate if incentives are high enough.

[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> as a fpga and gpu miner it all seems like a knee jerk reaction to misunderstood hardware and infrastructure akin to when gpu's first start coming on the scene as miners and started to push out CPU's as the dominant mining hardware. The same will happen with fpga's over the coming years. It's a natural progression in hardware and the argument of centralization because people have access to and buy a new form of hardware makes little to no sense. It's more a fear of people that have invested in gpu's not wanting to lose profits, when the move towards maximizing mining returns vs power usage and cost will continue to be leveraged across the mining ecosystem


[23-Dec-18 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Hi @uchirosan, welcome to the channel, maybe take a few minutes to familiarize yourself with our #announcements esp with regard to FPGA, and I encourage you to read some of @miketout ‚Äòs conversations on the subject in this channel if you do a search and filter by his name or simply scroll up.  Your message seems like the knee jerk here, esp as you just joined and posted this, which I believe you‚Äôll see if you take a moment to do some research.


[23-Dec-18 06:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> I read a number of posts as well as posts in other discord‚Äôs and your release notes for verus 2.0. None of which really made sense in terms of decentralization; it‚Äôs a term too often thrown around like loose leaf paper, but I decided to join the discord to hear more about what the community was saying about fpga‚Äôs


[23-Dec-18 06:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Definitely hope more coins and devs choose to keep an open mind regarding fpga‚Äôs and hardware progression as a whole


[23-Dec-18 06:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Out of curiosity what kind of equality are you looking to achieve amongst hardware?


[23-Dec-18 06:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> In terms of hash rate


[23-Dec-18 06:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> If balance can be achieved across most hardware, I say why not? When the price rises then fpgas may find it profitable to mine again, hand in hand with cpu and gpu. Wouldn't that be a better solution for the vast majority? It's a sound concept and one that makes the most sense rather than continually buying new hardware every time something better comes out. It's more spread out but also more efficient and economical. I don't really see a down side if a proper balance can be achieved


[23-Dec-18 06:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Finding a balance across hardware that has completely different capabilities and price points doesn‚Äôt make sense


[23-Dec-18 06:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> In what world would a $200 cpu mine the same as a $700 gpu etc


[23-Dec-18 06:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> So majority of the community the runs gpu‚Äôs goes down the tubes ?


[23-Dec-18 06:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Affects a lot more than fpga‚Äôs


[23-Dec-18 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Well ideally, what if a $200 cpu that hashes at 20mhs and a $2000 cpu hashes at roughly 200mhs maybe more for the investment? That seems like an ok deal


[23-Dec-18 06:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Not for a community built in people that already have hardware


[23-Dec-18 06:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Cpu or otherwise


[23-Dec-18 06:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> It‚Äôs the same arguments cpu miners made when gpu‚Äôs started mining


[23-Dec-18 06:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> But there was never a solution such as this proposed


[23-Dec-18 06:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> It was unfair to have gpu‚Äôs mining so much faster


[23-Dec-18 06:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> But there is no unfair here


[23-Dec-18 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> This Is a new concept one that focuses on balance


[23-Dec-18 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Reducing hashrate to hardware analogous  hurts more than helps the network


[23-Dec-18 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Unless your whole mining setup is based on CPU‚Äôs already vs gpu‚Äôs how does that help the current miners


[23-Dec-18 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> The network should be able to handle the hashrate drop


[23-Dec-18 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> It‚Äôs not about handling, I‚Äôm asking how it actually helps


[23-Dec-18 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Equalisation it isn't going to make CPUs any better


[23-Dec-18 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> It makes them better if their speed is the new norm for the network


[23-Dec-18 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Then yes it does


[23-Dec-18 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Any hash they can do becomes the new hash norm


[23-Dec-18 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'm sorry then I don't understand


[23-Dec-18 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I don't see the problem with balance being a goal


[23-Dec-18 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> More expensive Hardware will still perform better


[23-Dec-18 07:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> You're fpga will still perform much better than any CPU on the network


[23-Dec-18 07:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> That remains to be seen, your guessing


[23-Dec-18 07:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> It isn't going to make the CPU more profitable than using anything else


[23-Dec-18 07:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> For one, from what I read there will be no gpu or fpga miner to start


[23-Dec-18 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> So all the hash will be CPU‚Äôs


[23-Dec-18 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> No that is literally exactly how your Hardware functions


[23-Dec-18 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yes of course just like a lot of other projects


[23-Dec-18 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Bitstreams take time and require a coin be profitable


[23-Dec-18 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Exactly so that should come in time


[23-Dec-18 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> And at that point your fpga will be the most powerful thing on the network but CPU will still have a chance to be profitable at the same time


[23-Dec-18 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Which makes cpu mining more valuable does it not?


[23-Dec-18 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Until something else is on the network of course CPU will be the most profitable but you'll always get zero when you multiply by 0


[23-Dec-18 07:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> It will be the only option for a Time


[23-Dec-18 07:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That is how this coin started out


[23-Dec-18 07:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> We‚Äôll see how it plays out, I have a feeling gpu‚Äôs will get harder than you think


[23-Dec-18 07:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> But community members and active Developers created GPU miners and bit streams


[23-Dec-18 07:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I am with you there. We will see. I have no idea myself but I have my fingers crossed


[23-Dec-18 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Rarely works out to artificially  slow hardware progress by trying to reduce profitability of next gen hardware


[23-Dec-18 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> And has nothing to do with centralization


[23-Dec-18 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> That word is misused more than anything


[23-Dec-18 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I agree it is. I believe a lot of it is due to misunderstanding and the fact that there are a lot of complex Concepts coming together


[23-Dec-18 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> But at the end of the day we can only try


[23-Dec-18 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Fpga‚Äôs are open to everyone and will move to replace gpu‚Äôs


[23-Dec-18 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> They aren‚Äôt isolated or kept by companies like vitamin


[23-Dec-18 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Bitmain


[23-Dec-18 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Any miner can get an fpga and save on electricity and gain hash rate


[23-Dec-18 07:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Without buying a door stop asic


[23-Dec-18 07:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> If anything it should be the hardware most embraced moving forward especially as we see it start to cover all price points this next year


[23-Dec-18 07:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That isn't really how things played out recently though


[23-Dec-18 07:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Sure it is


[23-Dec-18 07:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Eventually hopefully it is more widespread and you can pick them up at Microcenter with a warranty


[23-Dec-18 07:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> There was no 1 person farming via fpga that nobody could get


[23-Dec-18 07:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> It‚Äôs next gen tech so of course adoption takes time


[23-Dec-18 07:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yeah but why hide the name and not let anyone in the corps Community now who could stand to benefit as well?


[23-Dec-18 07:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Most miners know nothing about fpga‚Äôs


[23-Dec-18 07:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> There wasn‚Äôt a single thing stopping any verus person here from grabbing an F1 and supporting the coin with higher efficiency


[23-Dec-18 07:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> If only anyone knew such a company existed


[23-Dec-18 07:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> As soon as this discord found out they could have looked into the hardware and started buying


[23-Dec-18 07:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> And enjoyed greater flexibility, power costs and hash rates


[23-Dec-18 07:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Which would have only strengthened the network further


[23-Dec-18 07:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Anyway, here's to the future and any advancements in technology, be it in hardware or software.


[23-Dec-18 07:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Anyways, always happy to have discourse, we‚Äôll see how it all works out:) happy holidays


[23-Dec-18 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> Ill chime in and say I agree with the fact that technology is always advancing and it cant be stifled.  I looked into FPGAs.  But the thing was the secrecy about the mining.  But again, its not like it has to be fair.  Just kinda shady


[23-Dec-18 07:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Thanks! Happy holidays to you as well!


[23-Dec-18 07:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Hiding of the coin was more for shady developers that try to steal bitstreams and from devs making knee jerk reactions


[23-Dec-18 07:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> I do agree it needs to be handled better in the future


[23-Dec-18 07:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> It‚Äôs a slippery slope with new hardware


[23-Dec-18 07:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> But in terms of hardware availability etc, it‚Äôs more than fair


[23-Dec-18 07:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> No bitmain shenanigans


[23-Dec-18 07:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> I agree with that


[23-Dec-18 07:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> It's refreshing to be able to discuss these differing opinions in a civilized manner because at the end of the day I think we all pretty much want the same things, everyone wants the project to do well.


[23-Dec-18 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'm actually doing some very last minute holiday shopping right now...


[23-Dec-18 07:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Ugh.


[23-Dec-18 07:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Good times lol


[23-Dec-18 07:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> there is no knee jerk here. your are making many false assumptions, and insulting people by claiming their ignorance where it doesn't exist. it's holidays. i will be happy to come back and discuss, but there was secret mining and sales of a promise of an unnamed algorithm on hardware that leveraged its significant advantage to take more of the profits from the network than all other miners, who invested to support the project. if you don't understand the plan, i'm sorry, but calling people knee jerk and making false assumptions that contradict the announcements about motivation isn't really the way we usually do things around here, also not what I did when visiting the FPGA Discord. good to meet you. happy holidays to you too.


[23-Dec-18 07:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Leveraging hardware is what mining is


[23-Dec-18 07:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> I‚Äôm not gonna argue about it, you guys made the choice and you‚Äôll deal with whatever comes next


[23-Dec-18 07:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> Happy Holidays:)


[23-Dec-18 08:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Nice veiled threat. Just as someone, and some of us know who, decided that rather than openly making their offering available to everyone who already was mining with different hardware out of interest in the project, they would sell secretly to a small number of people (centralized by definition) who didn‚Äôt know more about Verus than that they could spend less money by being covert and taking for a few secret miners the rewards designed (obviously with some prior weaknesses) to incentivize decentralization. If you‚Äôd prefer to further convince the community that we didn‚Äôt go far enough in response, that‚Äôs up to you, but we don‚Äôt usually react in a knee jerk fashion, so, as you said, we‚Äôll see.


[23-Dec-18 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> you keep saying small number of people as if the hardware was closed door and not available to everyone. If anything thats a veiled attempt to prop up your centralization statements. There was no threat there, you're a dev; you made the changes and are responsible for whatever comes of it. To try and make that seem like a threat is a bit childish


[23-Dec-18 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it was


[23-Dec-18 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the algo is still not named


[23-Dec-18 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> what does it being named do to you?


[23-Dec-18 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> are you able to go and buy the hardware right now if you want to?


[23-Dec-18 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @uchirosan It sounds like you said what you wanted to. Now you are carrying on. He didn't say that like it was a threat.


[23-Dec-18 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> only existing purchasers of the F1 could even know what it was, while many in the community would have purchased if it was open. not a smart decision at all IMO, but that was their decision.


[23-Dec-18 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> no one came here to tell us about it. all secret


[23-Dec-18 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> i'm not saying that hiding the bitstreams is the best course of action


[23-Dec-18 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> i dont think anyone in the fpga space wants that long term


[23-Dec-18 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> because the people who did it thought they could more easily sell secret miners that were NOT available easily to everyone than if everyone knew. that was the point


[23-Dec-18 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> mining is a competitive space as i'm sure you know


[23-Dec-18 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> and it will be again


[23-Dec-18 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> groups will alot of money have and will always have an advantage


[23-Dec-18 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> privacy of coin names is to help protect against larger entities stealing bitstreams


[23-Dec-18 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> almost all bitstream devs are working on teh same algo's


[23-Dec-18 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> across groups and companies


[23-Dec-18 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> open and available technology is great. when we see secret tech being used, we will respond


[23-Dec-18 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> the algo was secret, not the tech


[23-Dec-18 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> please be clear on that


[23-Dec-18 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> now, everyone gets a fresh chance to try again the right way


[23-Dec-18 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> ignorance of the tech doesnt make it secret


[23-Dec-18 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> implementation of the algo is tech


[23-Dec-18 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> just as is the new implementation


[23-Dec-18 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> f1 team is the only ones that even looked at verus for whatever reason


[23-Dec-18 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> not sure what their reasoning was on choosing your algo


[23-Dec-18 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> but they did


[23-Dec-18 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> we've had long discussions about the idea of secret algo'


[23-Dec-18 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> and there's conflicting ideas on both sides


[23-Dec-18 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> and we tried to work with them. maybe we still will, but the secret mining was not ok with our community, and I invented the new algo for the community


[23-Dec-18 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> you guys asked for their code didnt you?


[23-Dec-18 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> just so i understand, its your position that all technology types should be relatively equal in performance?


[23-Dec-18 08:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> What other project would have an FPGA bounty, as large as this one?  Hell, what other project would even offer a bounty?


[23-Dec-18 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> the bounty isn't there to help fpga's its to see what fpga's can do and to make adjustments to the algo if necessary


[23-Dec-18 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> don't mistake the reasoning


[23-Dec-18 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Lol


[23-Dec-18 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> that's not exactly true. i wrote what is the community's general position in the announcement. it's more a matter of not centralizing by doing exactly what was done. if everyone knows about and can get FPGAs, great, but we are going to work to make various computing hardware useful for mining


[23-Dec-18 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we are not doing anything covertly


[23-Dec-18 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the bounty is honest


[23-Dec-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> It is.


[23-Dec-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it is to prevent secrecy


[23-Dec-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> the bounty as stated is to see if someone makes a fpga bitstream that is 10 times faster


[23-Dec-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> then what happens?


[23-Dec-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> ther algo is adjusted to bring it down closer to gpu/cpu?


[23-Dec-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> there will be more than one because to get the bounty, it should be open


[23-Dec-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> thats not what i'm asking


[23-Dec-18 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> what happens if the performance is greater than 1.5x


[23-Dec-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> say 10 or 20x


[23-Dec-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> my initial statements to the community was a target of < 5x. we will see what it gets


[23-Dec-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we have no interest in preventing FPGAs from having a role in the community.


[23-Dec-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> so your saying a $2500-4k device should be <5x a 300 device?


[23-Dec-18 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> price/performance


[23-Dec-18 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i will be interested to see if anyone can get 5x


[23-Dec-18 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> price/performance optimizations is exactly what crypto hardware is all about


[23-Dec-18 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> to you


[23-Dec-18 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> having 20x performance of a 1080ti at 30% of the power use t hat anyone can buy is a good thing


[23-Dec-18 08:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> there's no hoarding of hardware


[23-Dec-18 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i believe it is actually all a proxy for decentralization


[23-Dec-18 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> which for many might just be words, but we are not just spouting words.


[23-Dec-18 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> how long do you anticipate gpu miner being available after fork?


[23-Dec-18 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it actually doesn't matter to me if that happens on any particular hardware


[23-Dec-18 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> that is not up to me, as I'm doing other things. i am helping at least one GPU dev who is making great progress, and there are others. I don't want to speak for him, but it's conceivable he will be ready by the fork. It may surprise you, but I am also helping at least one FPGA dev to understand as well. so far, it seems most people who have looked at the algo may not understand it fully yet.


[23-Dec-18 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> but the people who have come to ask for help or those who are working on behalf of the community certainly are welcome to do so


[23-Dec-18 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> other than the f1 team none of the other devs i know for other fpga's were working on verus algo


[23-Dec-18 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i guess you don't know them all


[23-Dec-18 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> i'm just referring to the ones I know active  on the bcu side


[23-Dec-18 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> there are lots of devs out there


[23-Dec-18 08:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> though the amount working on meaningful fpga implementations for non-secret use is pretty small


[23-Dec-18 08:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> most will go to large farms that we never hear about


[23-Dec-18 08:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @uchirosan Mike is actually very good for crypto, in general. You will find that he is very knowledgeable and very helpful. I think it's better to have a real, genuine conversation  with him than go back and forth with others here


[23-Dec-18 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> right now the fpga community is at the forefront of a new tech, at least in the general sense since fpga's have been around for a long time even in crypto


[23-Dec-18 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> but this is the first time it will come to the masses


[23-Dec-18 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> right, and we have no interest in making secret targeting of VerusHash something that is rewarded. open targeting of VerusHash is a completely different story, especially for those who are interested in making an actual decentralized system


[23-Dec-18 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> having hardware that provides great increases in performance doesn't increase centralization


[23-Dec-18 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> the secret part i can agree with


[23-Dec-18 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> so people got their rewards for secretly mining. now we can all start over and see how to do things correctly


[23-Dec-18 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> but you can't attribute large incremental increases in technology capabilities with decentralization


[23-Dec-18 08:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> variation and availability is what provides decentralization


[23-Dec-18 08:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> and if it happens again, the secret part, there are lots of knobs and dials on the new algo that any good dev who deals with them this time around will understand. no need to be secret about it. there's even an immediate reward not to be, and if we can work to cooperate together, if there is a future algo change, it can be something we do together. if that can't be, then it can't, but we would like to try.


[23-Dec-18 08:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> and i get what your saying, i just dont like people using the term decentralization as a metric to push off fpga's like its a monopoly like bitmain etc


[23-Dec-18 08:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> your network hash could be comprised of some huge farms of gpu's, that is centralization


[23-Dec-18 08:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> thats the same for any coin


[23-Dec-18 08:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> adding any other hardware to the system that is owned by miners everywhere helps to prevent centralization


[23-Dec-18 08:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> but at the end of the day majority of miners mine what is profitable


[23-Dec-18 08:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> if you only had miners on your network that truly believed in your coin, you'd have a small centralized network


[23-Dec-18 08:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i could have bricked the 325t chip that F1 one uses if that was our decision. it wasn't, and i hope i didn't. our initial hope was to get cooperation on the plan, but without that, I tried hard to make sure they could still implement the algo, though with a significantly smaller gap between CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs than there has been. until someone really does follow the algo, we won't know, but as there is more than one party wanting to, I guess we will see soon enough.


[23-Dec-18 08:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> ya a lot of unknowns, i'll definitely keep an eye on the space


[23-Dec-18 08:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> its always a slippery slope when you see coins fork a month after finding new hardware on their network


[23-Dec-18 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> if you're a dev, look at the algo. this wasn't a knee jerk fork. it was very purposeful and the algo was designed for that purpose. we just tend to work quickly


[23-Dec-18 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> you guys found out about 2 weeks after the algo was released


[23-Dec-18 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i don't think so


[23-Dec-18 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> i started mining it at release


[23-Dec-18 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> its only been out about 5-6 week now


[23-Dec-18 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> i could find the exact date


[23-Dec-18 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> the moment you guys found out about it, everyone in your network had the ability to buy an F!


[23-Dec-18 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> it was no longer secret


[23-Dec-18 08:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i started suspecting before that, and by the time it was sure, it was clear that the suspicions were likely accurate when it started. i'm pretty sure i know when it started being used, and it was a bit more than a couple weeks


[23-Dec-18 08:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> looks like its been about 7 weeks


[23-Dec-18 08:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> according to my stats


[23-Dec-18 08:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> so not that long


[23-Dec-18 08:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> you guys found out about a month ago?


[23-Dec-18 08:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> publicly i should say


[23-Dec-18 08:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> 4-5 weeks?


[23-Dec-18 08:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @uchirosan  What's the point you are trying to make, with this conversation?


[23-Dec-18 08:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> i'm having a conversation with him, not about a point


[23-Dec-18 08:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> we're just conversing


[23-Dec-18 08:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we could not recommend that people buy Blackminer's F1 that was potentially going to be bricked without a deal, and the community wanted this approach. i think it's actually quite reasonable, and i look forward to the first FPGA implementations. very curious how the algo will be solved, which is why we are willing to help FPGA devs. we have no illusions that we will stay immune to custom hardware forever. we just want to get there as a community, not by being sniped from the side.


[23-Dec-18 08:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> nobody has to make a point in a convo, you can gain valuable insight into thought processes and clearer understanding


[23-Dec-18 08:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> No problem. I was just curious.


[23-Dec-18 08:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> i do understand that @miketout


[23-Dec-18 08:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> like i said, i dont agree with secret mining


[23-Dec-18 08:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> its a double edged sword


[23-Dec-18 08:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i also understand your point


[23-Dec-18 08:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> most coins/devs are incentivized by the current hardware scheme


[23-Dec-18 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> having a piece of hardware that drastically changes the eco system playing field can cause a stir


[23-Dec-18 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> and part of the reason why some want to go in secretly


[23-Dec-18 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> not saying its right or wrong


[23-Dec-18 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> in fact, given this response, there is a scenario where it turns out only to be positive, but I hope the person behind the secret mining strategy finds another vocation. i don't think this is the way to get millions of people to buy FPGAs, which is the only thing that will allow them to help with decentralization.


[23-Dec-18 08:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> if they had come to you and said, we have a piece of hardware that is 20x greater than what you currently have; what would you have said?


[23-Dec-18 08:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> most gpu miners that want to fight against fpga's and asics is because theyve invested heavily into gpu's and have suffered the market losses and can't afford new hardware


[23-Dec-18 08:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> so they dont want said new hardware coming into the space


[23-Dec-18 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> we are going to see sub $1k fpga's early in 2019 and $500 fpga's shortly thereafter


[23-Dec-18 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i think 20x creates a problem, and i would have wanted to work with them on an algo change to close the gap while not preventing their miner to have an advantage as a professional tool that was specialized enough to economically deserve a premium. in fact, that is exactly what we tried to work out


[23-Dec-18 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> in a market where profits are next to nothing, fpga's can be the saving grace of the mining spher


[23-Dec-18 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> not at all


[23-Dec-18 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> what is the current hashrate on your algo on cpu and gpu?


[23-Dec-18 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> that argument is exactly the same as saying "there isn't enough to satisfy everyone who wants to participate, so just let a small number of people take more"


[23-Dec-18 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> you can look in the CPU hashrate channel. people are posting


[23-Dec-18 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> no,but stalling progress to help those that have hardware at the same of progression is just as bad


[23-Dec-18 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> there is no stalling of progress


[23-Dec-18 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> i would disagree with you there, the fact that you feel liek 20x performance on next gen hardware is too much and want to artificially bring it down is stalling progress


[23-Dec-18 08:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> thats saying, this new hardware is too fast relative to older hardware


[23-Dec-18 08:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> so we need to bring it down


[23-Dec-18 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> but i also see your point of view as well


[23-Dec-18 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I don't mean to butt in but I just wanted to add that in a system that is so young and where fpgas are not spread out or even known about it's hard to introduce them into a system with such huge electrical efficiencies where there is no small  connection  to price and price can be dropped down when a large Supply is controled


[23-Dec-18 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> It is good for progress


[23-Dec-18 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> introducing fpga's to the market does nothing to coin prices


[23-Dec-18 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the only argument that it is good is an argument that centralization is the cure to not enough mining profits. people are still mining with that advantage now, and if FPGAs follow the fork and cannot be faster than CPUs, it won't be because we wouldn't have cooperated to make that possible. it will be because we were not given that option. if we end up in a spot where FPGAs are definitely slower, we may actually consider a fork at the next natural point to do the opposite.


[23-Dec-18 08:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> It's just not going on across the entire Market


[23-Dec-18 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> for those that have mined long enough ,we saw the same arguments from devs when gpu's starting taking the stage:)


[23-Dec-18 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> and then again with asics


[23-Dec-18 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> though asics were slanted towards the manufacturers and not what the hardware could do


[23-Dec-18 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we were one of the only coins that made GPU and CPU mining work together on the network. FPGAs took advantage of a weakness in the algo, they didn't introduce some amazing new advance.


[23-Dec-18 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the algo was simply too small


[23-Dec-18 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> they dont typically introduce an amazing advance


[23-Dec-18 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> in many ways


[23-Dec-18 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> they just have the power to mine faster and more efficiently without being a door stop like an asic


[23-Dec-18 08:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> really the best of both worlds in mining


[23-Dec-18 08:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> and i'm a gpu miner for many many years


[23-Dec-18 08:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> and i swapped over to a number of fpga's because it made sense to do so


[23-Dec-18 08:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> in a time when efficiency can mean no profits or some profits


[23-Dec-18 08:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the idea that someone can mine more efficiently with more efficient hardware is a fallacy. it's all relative


[23-Dec-18 08:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> if everyone had FPGAs, they would be decentralizing, and they would not provide any advantage


[23-Dec-18 08:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> its not relative, a 1080ti uses a certain amount of power to mine a certain hash at a certain hardware cost


[23-Dec-18 08:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> right


[23-Dec-18 08:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> a product that can mine more coins, with less power with a better hash/hardware cost is more efficient


[23-Dec-18 08:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> but people will use more FPGAs and more electricity until they reach the amount they will spend


[23-Dec-18 08:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> no because fpga's cost more as well


[23-Dec-18 08:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> to compete at the level of their willingness to invest


[23-Dec-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> if your buidling a $2500 gpu rig


[23-Dec-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i'm talking long term


[23-Dec-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> vs a 2500 fpga


[23-Dec-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> which one is more efficient for the cost?


[23-Dec-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the only argument that they are more efficient is a relative argument


[23-Dec-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> power usage isn't relative


[23-Dec-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> its constant


[23-Dec-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> that is a relative question


[23-Dec-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> POW makes it constant


[23-Dec-18 08:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> power usage will go up when everyone has the same hardware to the same willingness to invest


[23-Dec-18 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> majority of people selling their gpu's would disagree with you


[23-Dec-18 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> those same people could buy an fpga and still be mining for the same upfront cost


[23-Dec-18 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> GPUs were shut out by FPGAs and ASICs relatively


[23-Dec-18 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> and not losing money  on power costs


[23-Dec-18 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> when everyone has FPGAs, you will have gained exactly zero efficiency in mining


[23-Dec-18 08:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> profit wise your right


[23-Dec-18 08:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> at geoscale


[23-Dec-18 08:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> as eveyrone gains the same hardware it equals out


[23-Dec-18 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> but if a single piece of hardware is the same price as say 10 piece of hardware, then even if profits remain the same but power costs go down then you gained something


[23-Dec-18 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> so, algorithms should do a good job to make dedicated mining investments, like FPGAs better, but not crushing the non-dedicated investments, like CPUs and GPUs, to the extent they can. that supports the scalable economics AND decentralization


[23-Dec-18 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> that is not stopping progress


[23-Dec-18 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> algorithms that can do that ARE progress


[23-Dec-18 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> you can't fully support cpu mining without hurting gpu mining and the like


[23-Dec-18 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> it can only be done artificially


[23-Dec-18 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it's all relative, and they all have their strengths and weaknesses


[23-Dec-18 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> no more artificial than proof of work itself


[23-Dec-18 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> cpu mining has strengths only if the aglo is built to use a cpu's architecture in a way that isnt' supported by gpu's


[23-Dec-18 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> CPUs are ASICs


[23-Dec-18 09:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> technically everything is an asic


[23-Dec-18 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> point being, PoW is about proof of work. it is arbitrary


[23-Dec-18 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> as long as it proves work


[23-Dec-18 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> right now, the algo "artifically" advantages FPGAs


[23-Dec-18 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> so, soon, it won't


[23-Dec-18 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> so your saying that by manualy reducing the effectiveness of hardware you work to maintain the status quo of hardware in a way that makes the network better?


[23-Dec-18 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> not sure if i worded that right


[23-Dec-18 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> i'm just tryin to see your pov


[23-Dec-18 09:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> you want to keep all hardware relative to one another regardless of what they are actually capable of


[23-Dec-18 09:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> by balancing the proof of work algorithm to leverage strengths and weaknesses of the available hardware worldwide in a way that both incentivizes dedicated mining and doesn't close the door to casual mining, i believe there is much more chance of true decentralization. just because no one is doing it well now doesn't mean it is not achievable


[23-Dec-18 09:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> whatever they are capable of, proof of work only proves investment and interest in observing the protocol due to economic risk, nothing more


[23-Dec-18 09:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> i look forward to seeing how it works out


[23-Dec-18 09:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> me too üòÉ


[23-Dec-18 09:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> mining isnt an altruistic endeavor unfortuantely


[23-Dec-18 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> at least pow isn't


[23-Dec-18 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> if a coin you believe in is profitable then you mine it, if its not profitable then you mine something else and buy what you believe in


[23-Dec-18 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> thats the reality of mining


[23-Dec-18 09:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> but i hope you guys are successful with the changes and i'll definitely keep an eye out for how it comes along


[23-Dec-18 09:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> will be curious to see how hash rates work out across the board


[23-Dec-18 09:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> agreed to some extent. there's a thing called "speculative mining", and mining one coin just to sell it and buy another doesn't always get you the same result. when some large group of people lose financially due to factors that were both out of their control and secretly leveraged by a small group, that is quite the opposite of altruistic in a way this community prefers is eventually eliminated by not being rewarded. we prefer a system where people don't have to be altruistic, just one that rewards openness more than a covert approach.


[23-Dec-18 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> at the end of the day, only a small amount of miners on your network will mine a coin that isn't profitable; those that believe in the coin or those that are hoping for a pump at some point


[23-Dec-18 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> otherwise it makes more sense to mine something that is profitable and buy the coin you  believe in


[23-Dec-18 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> people dont mine at a loss out of the goodness of their heart


[23-Dec-18 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> that's ok


[23-Dec-18 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> there are lots of variables of course


[23-Dec-18 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> but thats just a rough statement


[23-Dec-18 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> anyways, good talkin to you..glad to hear your pov and wish you Happy Holidays!


[23-Dec-18 09:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> at least when things are more equal, we won't lose 70% of the hash power when one data center goes offline. that only happened when many who didn't have the secret FPGA algo found it no longer something they should mine and the PoW became much more centralized. we expect that to go back to a healthier state for the network


[23-Dec-18 09:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Happy Holidays to you too!

[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Bloody hell , iv been mining at a loss since i started i think, maybe a few months ago before the secret algo 1 was getting targeted, i was in profits but that didn‚Äôt last long , 
Profits are nice , but are not everything , just sayin üòé
Merry xmas everyone üéÑ


[24-Dec-18 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Since fpga‚Äôs secretly came on the network its become practically silly for me to try to compete , im still staking verus and i do keep coming back to mine it now and then but right now i carnt justify leaving my rig clinging on to 2 verus coins a day when its costing me ¬£1.50p a day in electric, i feel bad saying that but all i can do is wait patiently for the fork , to make it fairer for everyone, and not just a few lucky people

[24-Dec-18 04:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zawy> what CPUs are considered effective with the new POW?


[24-Dec-18 04:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> I see some advantage in having higher clocked core, and probably more cache. So oveclocked xeon could be on top this time.


[24-Dec-18 04:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> But there are not so big differences in performance per 1 core.


[24-Dec-18 04:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> 1-2 mhs per core in general.


[24-Dec-18 05:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zawy> then I just wonder what this means ``` it is far more likely that the CPUs in those PCs will be older, rather than the newest models. With VerusHash 2.0, modern CPUs are strongly advantaged over older CPUs, and the newest, advantaged even more.```


[24-Dec-18 06:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @zawy I'm not the expert, but if you look at the #cpu-hashrate channel you can see the perf of CPUs presently and historically, while the hash rate will be much lower after the fork this is a good place to begin determining what's best.  Personally I'm going to utilize an i7-8700. If I was going to buy something new it would be the i9.  I'm curious to see the new numbers after the fork!  In the old hash I always got better perf from my i7 over my Xeon, but again, I'm not an expert on CPUs or the features of each when compared to each other.

Can anyone tell me if I need to update anything before this snapshot tomorrow?

I have some vrsc in the Agama wallet for Android .

Complete noob here, sorry if I sound stupid .

[dscrdvrsc] <shitcoin_shaman> @John Westbrook ? Please anyone?

I'm not on windows or Mac ,I'm on Android mobile Agama wallet .
I don't want to lose my VRSC after this fork , will I need to update the wallet ?
There's no update available on Google play yet .

Can anyone tell me what I need to do,  please?

[28-Dec-18 10:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> @shitcoin_shaman You will not lose your balance of vrsc, as the main fork will continue on. If you're staking(POS) your balance you'll need to update your wallet(0.5). If you mining(POW) you'll need to have the latest miner or wallet supporting verushash 2.0, depending if you're mining solo(wallet 0.5) or pool(nheqminer).


[28-Dec-18 10:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <shitcoin_shaman> Thank you for replying @zpajk 

I'm just staking in the Android version of the Agama wallet.
So I guess I'll just wait for that update to hit the Google app store and update it then?

I was worried I'd lose my funds if I didn't update before tonight.

Phew , panic over.

Many are still here. http://vrsc.52hash.com/stats The thing I am noticing is a lot of F*** FPGA sentiment. I am under the impression that Verus isn't necessarily against FPGA's, in fact they seem to  be support by the VRSC community. It is just that it turns out FPGA's had a unfair advantage in VH1, and VH2 is aimed to even the playing field,  not necessarily get rid of them like some coins have tried with ASICS. I may be missing the point here, but what draws me to this coin is the concept of trying to include all types of miners on as even of a playing field as possible

I would add they are doing more than I would do if I was in their situation. Working with the FPGA developers to try to get them to slow down their devices is a losing battle and shouldn't even be offered. Especially considering the secret mining they did; that act could be considered an act of aggression against their project and shouldn't be rewarded with cooperation. IMHO

[28-Dec-18 11:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> there was an adjustment. we still need more CPU mining, it looks like to get fully on target, but there was a significant adjustment at the fork. difficulty divided by 512

[dscrdvrsc] <karero> Hey Team! Amazingly smooth transition! Did the network hash rate drop with the fork to about a little over half, is that correct? Is that what you expected? Looks like most miners are actively involved and updated in time.

[29-Dec-18 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> @karero  Network hash still dropping.. i believe its calculated from the difficulty which adjusts over time. I could be wrong on that method, but I do know that the hash is much much lower than currently shown.  it will be in GH/s not TH/s


[29-Dec-18 12:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> Yes @Gmoney I just noticed. Strangely the network hash dropped even further... good point about the calculation. I‚Äôd expect sth in the rage of 5-25% of what it was before, like you said maybe 5+ GH/s


[29-Dec-18 12:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> I'm going to make a prediction that the network hash is at 750GH-800GH


[29-Dec-18 12:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> Ups ya I missed some orders of magnitude... @Gmoney ü§ì so 800 GH would be more like 2% of what it was before, right?


[29-Dec-18 12:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> ya... ish.. 
and I doubt net hash is any higher than that. maybe lower 
600-800


[29-Dec-18 12:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> no shit wait.. my calcs are way off


[29-Dec-18 12:32 AM] Gateway#3763

[29-Dec-18 12:32 AM] Gateway#3763

[29-Dec-18 12:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> wayy off.. spreadsheet error


[29-Dec-18 12:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gina Minehart> I'd say around 20GHs.


[29-Dec-18 12:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> ya .. based on my current luck.. we are at 28.5GH


[29-Dec-18 12:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> Very interesting to see how the chain absorbs the ‚Äúshock‚Äù of the fork over some time...


[29-Dec-18 12:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> of course.. luck on such a short timeframe is no reliable


[29-Dec-18 12:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> @Gina Minehart and @Gmoney you seem to be very much in line üòâ


[29-Dec-18 12:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the difficulty adjusted immediately, and the hash rate average is catching up


[29-Dec-18 12:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> or, almost immediately


[29-Dec-18 12:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> @miketout is it proportional? Will the same factor for the difficulty adjustments be true for the network hash?


[29-Dec-18 12:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it should adjust naturally over the next hour or so. it was a factor only put on the prior algorithm's blocks to calculate the difficulty. after they are out of the equation, it should be as normal, just lower hash


[29-Dec-18 12:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jbates58> well, so far, there is a 198% reduction in nethash rate, and yet, there is a 16% increse in difficulty.... lolwut??


[29-Dec-18 12:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> the calc net average is adjusting quickly now


[29-Dec-18 12:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jbates58> 199% nethash drop


[29-Dec-18 12:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> wallet mining is roughly 30% slower than nheqminer


[29-Dec-18 12:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jbates58> 6% difficulty increse


[29-Dec-18 12:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jbates58> my figures are also based on the difficulty and nethash at last block before fork


[29-Dec-18 12:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> If it‚Äôs proportional to the drop in difficulty I get to 56 GH/s (well bases on my math: current diff 200‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô/ before diff 141‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô (screenshot from 66tbird from community support from 12/20) =0.2/141=0.0014184=0.14%. MuLtiplied with former 20TH/s gets me to 56 GH/s

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it'll bounce a little, but i think we have double digit GH/s and the diff is going up and down as it should right now. with the PoP algo, we do have relatively high variance, but i think we should grow from here

[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> Not going to lie..This is somewhat disappointing .. One week to solo mine on a 6 core.. 12 threat i7. These are the numbers when the hashrate started to get away from us when GPU's were taking over (and thats when rewards were at 96 per block). I was hoping on a little glimpse of the glory days


[29-Dec-18 01:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Gmoney this definitely represents a larger number of people, which is good for the project in the long run. There will be CPU farms, but everyone gets similar economics. Having more participants strengthens security, and value is directly related to the network effect as well.


[29-Dec-18 01:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> @miketout of course I'm speaking selfishly with myself in mind. Higher net hash is good for Verus and the project as long as its all good intentioned hash üòÉ


[29-Dec-18 01:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gmoney> I have a feeling this Net hash will back down to high single digits though.

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> There are two versions now. One is mostly asm. One emulates the asm and is in C++, but assumes little endian data layout. Right now, Chris is probably 80+% done with a cuda version, and I am about 90% done with a fully Python implementation. Those will be complete before there is any detailed write up. For a while, the code will serve as the documentation with more portable and different versions in progress.

[29-Dec-18 11:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> sure doesn't seem like decentralization is happening. FPGAs were better than huge CPU mining farms


[29-Dec-18 11:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> you'd prefer secret mining by a very small number at 20x the best efficiency you can get with commodity equipment that can enable real decentralization? I'm looking forward to GPUs and even seeing what FPGAs can do, but right now, these miners only get a better deal than you due to their own economies of scale. I believe real decentralization happens when an unlimited number of people feel they can compete in mining and staking. At this time, everyone can mine proportionally to the CPUs they control, everyone. It will likely be similar in economics, maybe a little better with GPUs, and we will see what FPGAs do when they come back. Blackminer has said they are working on the algorithm, and there is an interesting other company, who seems to be making a nice offering with the community in mind. I do believe that when FPGAs come back, they will at least come back openly, and everyone will get to make choices with more information. As we saw in the early days of Verus, which also had some large CPU miners, these are likely mostly independent entities, just as the many more miners of smaller hashrate, who now have a chance, collectively make up a much longer tail. i'm just keeping my CPUs pointed at Verus. My GPUs are cold right now.


[30-Dec-18 12:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> 10% is much less than 75%


[30-Dec-18 12:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> granted 10% is bigger than 1%, but it is a lot less than 75%


[30-Dec-18 12:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> and before the single fpga pool had about 75% of hashrate, which is above 50% and not a very good thing at all.
with current distribution of hash across various large CPU farms still it seems half the hashrate is from solo miners


[30-Dec-18 12:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> and this is before the GPU come back, so to make any judgements now is premature


[30-Dec-18 12:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grendel25> @miketout @GEBucky   There are valid points to be made on both parts of this decentralization discussion.  I'll still go in favor of the agile developer that pulls off such a smooth fork.  Although, it is discerning to look at hashrates from top-5 miners and realize it's around 1/3 the network hashrate.  All we can do is keep trying.


[30-Dec-18 12:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> as opposed to one at 75%?


[30-Dec-18 12:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> usually when assessing a change, you compare the before vs after, not the after vs theoretical perfection


[30-Dec-18 12:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> and this is very similar to the early days CPU only period. the GPU mining should smooth things out more.


[30-Dec-18 12:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> if the top 5 miners in BTC combined, it would seem to be a lot more than 1/3rd


[30-Dec-18 12:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> what we are seeing so far is quite amazing result, the proof of the pudding will be the GPU and fpga performance


[30-Dec-18 01:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> @miketout I am still complexed by the "secret mining" phrase. Nothing secret about it. Came up with a fast algo that ran well on F1 with Verus, and the individuals that owned them did benefit. But wan't some secret corporation. Blackminer just figured out a great solution to your algo, and it was individuals, not corporations mining it. How level is it with the hashrate chart I just put up? I just think it's like putting speed bumps on the buggy path to slow the cars down. It may work short term, but it just seem like a bad strategy and what I see would seem to demonstrate that. I have nothing but respect for your project, the hard work that has gone into it, and the future potential. I think the race to balance between decentralization and innovation is healthy. It will be a continual battle why we are on POW. But we gotta stop with the "secret shit". Yes - people use code names when the get a jump. It's called competing. Not sure Bill Walsh published his playbook every week. üòÉ


[30-Dec-18 01:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> And a FPGA developer will eventually find a 1 Gh/s solution - maybe not Blackminer but someone will. So I admire the goal and respect the vision of the project. Will be interesting to watch those hash rate distributions in the coming months. Socialism is hard to pull off in technology


[30-Dec-18 01:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> The hash to energy consumption will be more economical


[30-Dec-18 01:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> @GEBucky This is explained many times over, see #announcements for example. The few FPGAs tried to hide it and didn‚Äôt want to cooperate after being exposed, which lead to the algo change to level the playing field instead. And there‚Äôs even a bounty out on a open FPGA miner, verus isn‚Äôt against FPGAs as a whole.


[30-Dec-18 01:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> It's better long term

[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> @zpajk cooperate with whom? Perhaps a look at Satoshi's white paper may help. The whole idea behind trustless transactions is not having any alignment between the underlying coin, or the people doing the transactions.


[30-Dec-18 02:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i think it's proper style to mix in some good behaviour with the 'full freedom', thus cooperation at some points seems logical.


[30-Dec-18 02:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and you can always choose not to be the only one to have a massive advantage and thus not look fishy


[30-Dec-18 02:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> Who do you think is going to "cooperate" in a world where everyone is looking for a technological advantage. This isn't a freaking commune  .


[30-Dec-18 02:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i do however get your point tho. it's maybe just boiling down to a 'style question' in the end


[30-Dec-18 02:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> @0x03 fair enough - I think the algo coding freaked people out. But GPU folks do it, FPGA folks do it. Just protecting IP if they came up with a better miner


[30-Dec-18 02:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> so we're effectively trying to replace the one elitary system ('world financial system') with another, where patents on EVERYTHING will be given out? so to properly participate, you'll have to expose the same properties as in the old system, as a fuckton of money to get enough mining hardware? hahahaha


[30-Dec-18 02:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> that doesnt make a lot of sense. sadly is partial reality already


[30-Dec-18 02:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> I see both sides of this - and have a pretty good stockpile of both FPGAs and GPUs. Concerns me that the battle will be destructive to some really good projects. But Darwin is gonna win here - just life.


[30-Dec-18 02:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> this one may be an unpopular opinion: we're kind of playing good vs. bad all of the time anyways.


[30-Dec-18 02:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> good being the one who plays fair


[30-Dec-18 02:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> bad the one who doesnt


[30-Dec-18 02:08 AM] Gateway#3763

[30-Dec-18 02:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> it's not going to happen


[30-Dec-18 02:08 AM] Gateway#3763

[30-Dec-18 02:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <its> @GEBucky Right now I have a dozen machines on Verus. I have also mined it with GPUs in the past. All the miners I have used have been open source and this seems to be integral in this community. I do have a couple of FPGAs running on different algorithms so I have nothing against FPGAs. At the end of the day, a successful coin has to distribute itself to the widest number of people and enable useful use cases. There is a lot of room for experimentation how to get there.


[30-Dec-18 02:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> There isn't a right or wrong here. This debate is essential to the future of crypto, at least POW crypto. But there are a lot of great closed source miners (zenemy, trex, cryptodredge). I don't begrudge them for keeping their IP private and charging a fee. If you don't like it, don't use it. Kinda my thinking there.


[30-Dec-18 02:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> I haven't seen ios anywhere on github for anyone to download


[30-Dec-18 02:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> @GEBucky Like I wrote before, this has already been explained before. Verus has ment to be a good mix between tech, and they have rightfully done so. FPGA folks weren't playing along, so there was a algo change. This time around they might have a change of heart, maybe not. Then we'll see the state of affairs. Right now you're bringing up the same old arguments before the fork, which aren't speaking to this specific project. g2g pack for a trip.


[30-Dec-18 02:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> We will see you soon @zpajk


[30-Dec-18 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <its> @GEBucky Again, it depends on the coin and its community. I have used both open and closed source miners and usually it is not a prime consideration for me but the Verus folks have a slightly different view. I bet they would react the same if a closed CPU miner gave its users 20x advantage.


[30-Dec-18 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> My opinion on the fork is that it went perfectly. 100% of people with a decent cpu and decent electricity rates can compete. We always knew that the Chinese with cheap hardware, cheap electricity and cheap overheads would build farms that are better. With the new GPU miners on the horizon there will be a similar situation where big Chinese gpu farms will have a big advantage. The spreading out the hash rate now is much better. It's pretty much as good the project can realistically make it.


[30-Dec-18 02:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> Where exactly do you think the folks that have about 60% of the hash on Verus are right now?. Vermont? no. Kansas, no?. Don't get all xenophobic on the Chinese here. Lots of us companies building FPGAs (most are actually US based) and it has very little to do with electricity rates.  Have a look at that hash distribution. There must be 10,000 Threadrippers on Verus right now. they are not super efficient from an electricity perspective.


[30-Dec-18 02:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> And I did put 4 very high end CPUs on Verus - and we will see but right now not seeing how you get to the 100% working. I do not want to be  a hater here - but I am a realist. So will see how the hash distribution, and returns work out for CPUs. I will happily report my results.


[30-Dec-18 02:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lumbi> If it was possible to identify where the big miners (PoW inflation) were coming from,  I imagine a distributed system of the future should be able to block them from reaching more than a total percentage of the hash --  like ddos attackers & cloud flare.


[30-Dec-18 02:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GEBucky> That's actually a good idea - not sure how you would do it but, to me, that would be more core to the point.


[30-Dec-18 02:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @0x03 Welcome back üòÉ


[30-Dec-18 02:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I think that would have to be done on the pool level and in a decentralized system there is no one forcing them to operate like that so I imagine those limits would have to be somehow implemented in the blockchain but that is beyond me


[30-Dec-18 02:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <evilwar> You could never stop botnets though, so cheating the ones who have legit hardware vs not being able to do anything to the ones actually cheating sounds terrible imo

[30-Dec-18 02:58 AM] Gateway#3763

[30-Dec-18 03:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> they should've labeled it 'the fact that you check this mark wont influence the decision of the algorithm behind anyways. its just to give you the feeling of being somewhat in control of what you do'


[30-Dec-18 03:02 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @0x03 that's funny, I imagined something similar but with doom since its older and wouldnt use much resources from the pc but it would effectively eliminate botnets and asics and could you imagine the farms?! Hah a bunch of people crammed in a warehouse playing 90's games?


[30-Dec-18 03:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That could work pretty well for decentralization especially since no one person would want to sit in front of their computer that long mining but yeah I guess the game would have to be pretty addictive you wouldn't want the possibility of everyone getting bored with it and the chain stopping or slowing down


[30-Dec-18 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lumbi> gamers would love it if it was integrated... pays them to game!

[30-Dec-18 03:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> If it were some sort of MMORPG then even in-game currency could be crypto for artifacts or whatever and it could create a whole world

[dscrdvrsc] <Lumbi> a virtual world with real money

[30-Dec-18 03:26 AM] Gateway#3763

[30-Dec-18 03:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I've never played it but I got pretty hooked on watching YouTube videos for the PC game rust. That game seems like it has its own mini economy. If that game mined and used in game crypto currency it would take it a step further

[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Thank you for the kind words @Godballz, although I think I know what you meant by ‚ÄúVerus team‚Äù in truth there is no team or company, and everyone, devs included, are simply community members all contributing together to realize the Verus vision. This is an aspect I really dig about this project!  Together Verus exists.  

This is not to, in any way, diminish @miketout‚Äôs contributions as lead developer or visionary in founding along with other cofounders, certainly we wouldn‚Äôt be here without these guys coming together and taking action, and I have a deep regard and appreciation for Mike‚Äôs skills and talents as a developer and inventor. And, ultimately what has been created here is truly unique to any other project in every way, especially that of how everyone can be a part of building this project as a truly decentralized community of co-contributors. 

And on that note, again thank you for all you do to help around and contribute!  And thank you @Cragornand  @stretcher83  for your replies as well! ü§òüòé


[01-Jan-19 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> @John Westbrook I read all the articles you link here. I learn something new each time, and it feels effortless since you explain things so that anyone can understand the basic consepts. At the same time you manage to explain just how important and awesome the development from the Verus contributors is to crypto and the future in general. Mike has blown me away with what he has managed to deliver in these short months. A lot more people should get to know about this awesome work and understand why it is important, and with your articles they will. Keep up the good work!

[dscrdvrsc] <sandi17> hai.. how i can get bounty ..


[01-Jan-19 11:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the Verus Coin Foundation pays bounties to people who contribute to the project in different ways at its discretion. often bounties are unexpected and offered to people who have just been helping in different ways. generally, the way to earn bounties is to learn about things that need to be done or think of things that need to be done and start helping out. if you have a specific skill and feel it could be helpful, please DM @Asher , @John Westbrook , @michaeltoutjr, or me explaining your thoughts. right now, the Foundation currently has a couple large open bounty offers for advanced algorithm development on GPUs and FPGAs. aside from that, there are regular bounties paid at the discretion of the Foundation to people who really help others or make a real difference in helping the Verus Project gain awareness. These are often not offered beforehand and are just paid as part of recognizing community contributions.

[dscrdvrsc] <dude> Do I own now two coins or what ?


[02-Jan-19 08:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Do you mean two types of coins now due to the fork? If so, then the answer is no. You should only have one type, the most recent one.


[03-Jan-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> So it‚Äôs not a fork ?


[03-Jan-19 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> it's a fork, change of pow


[03-Jan-19 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @dude if you'd like to run an old version of the wallet and stay on the other fork, you are welcome to do so if it runs. there is no connection to the Verus community or support from any community developers for that fork, and we would consider it obsoleted by the new version that is available now. It is also not notarized by Komodo or part of the KMD ecosytem, and it's algorithm has been centralized by FPGA miners, so if they are going to carry a project forward with what they have left, you can decide if you think it is worth your time.


[03-Jan-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> what I am actually asking was that my private key is now getting access to a wallet from the original vrsc and now the new 2.0 fork ? Or is original vrsc completely down ?


[03-Jan-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> ah


[03-Jan-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> you would have access to both, but I believe the older fork will not exist for long if it does at all right now. if you're worried about replay, that should not be an issue.

[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> No. CPU is currently preferred though, until when(and if) GPU catches up, and/or FPGA bitstreams are made.  The algorithm  has been made with intent to level them closer together. Check #announcements for details.

[06-Jan-19 12:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> they haven't decided to do it yet, but the time locked mining support in Verus would likely work fine for what they need.


[06-Jan-19 12:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Fisher Pri Catz> what is time locked mining?


[06-Jan-19 01:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> Mining blocks that are time locked after you hash them


[06-Jan-19 01:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Any rough idea on how much of an effect the time locked rewards will have on the overall supply in two years? For example, it's fairly easy to get on the top 100 list right now with 20k vrsc- is there any idea how drastically this list is expected to change by the next halving?


[06-Jan-19 01:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I can 100% appreciate early supporters getting rewarded for their faith and effort, I'm just wondering if there is a clear representation of the proportion of distribution.


[06-Jan-19 01:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Nevermind I think I found it but my math might be off- does 16.67% of supply sound about right?


[06-Jan-19 03:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> The more important question is how much of that timelocked VRSC is lost forever because of the wallet discards etc


[06-Jan-19 03:43 AM] Gateway#3763

[07-Jan-19 11:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Etherion> I found an address that has 117 60mhs cpus


[07-Jan-19 11:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Etherion> About 7ghs total


[07-Jan-19 11:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> Hmm @Etherion @miketout  mentioned the new AMD Ryzen TR 2990WX would get 60 MH/s

[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> If not that it could be multiple miners under the same worker name.


[07-Jan-19 11:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Etherion> Wow. Someone owns 117 of them


[07-Jan-19 11:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <karero> But setting up 117 of these does not sound like sth someone would do...

[08-Jan-19 05:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <uchirosan> @GEBucky just under 50% of the network hash is controlled by 4 miners from that one pool and they represent 95% of that pools hash


[08-Jan-19 05:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> 51% attack proof... they don't "control" the network hash. They might make a dent in trade price, but still no control.


[08-Jan-19 06:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Since we are talking about CPUs now instead of FPGAs, their electricity costs are likely higher giving them incentive to sell higher. This is still a much more favorable outcome and the best way to spread the hash is to get the word out there and tell everyone with a CPU to get mining and get in on the PoW revolution!


[08-Jan-19 07:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> CPU mining is where it's at

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Cragorn, @Lennart thanks, hope it wasn't too long. I wanted to break down and simplify a lot of complex things so it could be easily understood by even those not so familiar with crypto.


[08-Jan-19 11:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lennart> yeah you did a great job there. i¬¥m not english native, but was so easy to read


[08-Jan-19 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Really blown away by what Verus has been able to pull off. I can't imagine other PoW coins being able to ignore this now


[08-Jan-19 11:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lennart> sadly this kind of information seems not so valuable to the masses in these times...


[08-Jan-19 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lennart> but there will be a time "soonish" i hope, when people will value true decentralization again


[08-Jan-19 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> It is very impressive! I have love for a good handful of projects but honestly Verus is the most outstanding by a fairly large margin in tech and invention, development, community, and vision...with the talent and skill within the community to realize the vision. ‚ù§


[08-Jan-19 11:05 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <dude> Can someone tell me what‚Äôs the use case for veruscoin ?


[08-Jan-19 11:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Before getting too far into it, I can think of one right off the bat after yesterday's attack on ETC...a secure 51% hash attack immune place for your crypto money!


[08-Jan-19 11:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> So you might say a 51% hash attack immune and private store of value.

[08-Jan-19 11:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Godballz we've got some time to go before that is likely, while we work on PBaaS. Komodo has their own timelines and priorities. At some point, I would expect jl777 and I to coordinate to get VerusHash 2.0 into Komodo because people will want it. Talking about that, or speculating on when it might be probably won't help anyone, as right now, it is in Verus. There is no specific timeframe or energy going towards doing that now, and it will be a meaningful amount of work for someone whenever that time comes.
@dude as with all cryptocurrencies, a primary use case is money, and the level of network security and resistance to various forms of attack that Verus is demonstrating right now shows why people should use very secure networks like Verus over other, maybe even larger coins based on older technologies that haven't been upgraded with solutions to their well known weaknesses. We prefer to talk about how it works today, while we work on, but don't hype or sell the future. Right now, Verus has many use cases, starting with one of the most secure cryptocurrencies for money to private / permanent / notarized messaging, to every BTC and Zcash use case with arguably much more advanced security, and as such provides a better, more secure, more private cryptocurrency than most all of the projects out there.
As far as use cases that we envision for the future, that is PBaaS, including the advance of public provisioning that it will bring, the new profit potential for stakers, miners, and service providers, as well as applications, such as identity and voting that it will first enable, which we believe will be only a couple important ones among many, geo-scalable blockchain applications.


[08-Jan-19 12:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> How will PBaaS work ? Are there any PoC ? How will it look for a dev that will use PBaaS ? Is there a API available ?


[08-Jan-19 12:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @dude I recommend reading the vision paper, it's really the best place to begin.  It's a really well articulated and in-depth document.  Here it 'tis: https://veruscoin.io/downloads/papers/VerusVision.pdf - I recommend the entire read, but you can also jump down to page 7 "autochains"


[08-Jan-19 12:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> is there a roadmap ? Or when can we exspect some milestones ?


[08-Jan-19 12:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> No, there is not a roadmap, there is a vision paper üòÉ which discusses phases of the project


[08-Jan-19 12:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> If you're curious as to specific achievements made in the project, you can also read the blog at: https://medium.com/VerusCoin and particularly the post I did at the beginning of the year where I listed out some of the big highlights, here:

[08-Jan-19 12:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> So there is only a vision but not really a PoC or any idea how the vision could work or how it could be implemented ?


[08-Jan-19 12:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> What part of the technology and vision are you specifically referring to?  I think it would make more sense if you read the very thorough and infomative visino paper, white paper for phase 1, post above and maybe dig a little in the blog to see what has, so far, been developed and implemented.


[08-Jan-19 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763

[08-Jan-19 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Cool.  Something I like about the Verus project and the developers is their commitment to actually creating things without hyping anything up in advance. As a community member and contributor to communications and messaging I find this to align with my own philosophies of actions over words and spending "talk time" talking about what has been done or is being done now.  And, at the same time, having strong vision...that when combined with the sort of consistent and strong follow through developers have demonstrated...inspires belief, support and more contributing members üòÉ

How does this equalize CPU vs GPUS, and what prevents a person from rewiring a GPU software mine a GPU like many CPUS ?

[09-Jan-19 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> A quote from John Westbrook's latest article (<https://link.medium.com/0PkgXaJ3jT>) -
"The algorithm leverages the features of modern CPUs, leaving other hardware such as GPU or FPGA, already advantaged in other ways, to do the same work using whatever optimizations developers of such software and hardware are able to achieve. For example, modern CPUs have higher clock speeds than FPGAs, highly integrated internal ASICs, and on-chip memory, the fastest being it‚Äôs L1 Cache.
By designing VerusHash 2.0 such that it utilizes each of these advantages to run more efficiently, any device without them needs to find other ways to get those same efficiencies. Rather than explicitly attempting to block FPGAs or GPUs from functioning on the algorithm, the approach simply goes all out in leveraging efficiencies that CPUs can bring to the table, leaving FPGAs and GPUs to fend for themselves in other ways."

[10-Jan-19 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> @dude you can have R transactions on VRSC, while on ARRRRR you can't


[10-Jan-19 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> does this mean that ARRRRR is like ultra anonymous?


[10-Jan-19 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> btw: where are all the miners? its like every pool is dead with 1-20 workers


[10-Jan-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @dude people mine solo as well üòÉ


[10-Jan-19 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> And not sure where you see the 1-20 worker stats?  for example, luckpool has ~118


[10-Jan-19 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> But to get back to your previous question about differences between ARRR and VRSC, great question!  yes, there are a lot of differences. I'll share a few of the more distinct Verus specifics üòÉ  Verus has a unique and new consensus algorithm called Proof of Power which is a 50% PoW/50% PoS algo that solves theoretical weaknesses in other PoS systems (Nothing at Stake problem for example) and is provably immune to 51% hash attacks.  With this, Verus uses the new hash algo, VerusHash 2.0.  VerusHash 2.0 is designed to better equalize mining across all hardware platforms, while favoring the latest CPUs over older types, which is also one defense against the centralizing potential of botnets. Unlike past efforts to equalize hardware hash-rates across different hardware types, VerusHash 2.0 explicitly enables CPUs to gain even more power relative to GPUs and FPGAs, enabling the most decentralizing hardware, CPUs (due to their virtually complete market penetration), to stay relevant as miners for the indefinite future.  As for anonymity, Verus is not a "forced private", allowing for both transparent and shielded (private) transactions...and private messages as well.


[10-Jan-19 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> isnt it quite scary that coins like ARRRR or Zcash exists? How could I ever see the supply? When I find a bug and could doublespend some coins the whole system is broken but noone could ever detect it


[10-Jan-19 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> imho zcash is also the best scam ever due to the beginning of this coin (genesis) and also the dev fees etc.

[10-Jan-19 06:50 PM] Gateway#3763

[10-Jan-19 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Yeah but how are they under attack and what‚Äôs the issues with needing a vps for the mn


[10-Jan-19 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Railrain> Because:
- the wallet is not encrypted
-VPS is located on the equipment of third parties
   I think so ü§î


[10-Jan-19 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> with a MN you dont store coins on the VPS


[10-Jan-19 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> its all stored locally and the MN on the VPS just has the transaction details to prove you own the coins / they are locked and not re spent to claim the rewards


[10-Jan-19 08:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> someone can gain access to one of my MNs and they would not have access to any funds


[10-Jan-19 09:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Railrain> @Ginasis Mining Pools But this does not apply to VRSC staking.


[10-Jan-19 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Lux might have a mobile wallet that'll stake...
But, you have to stake over 2100 Lux, at ¬¢.62 today, to receive .6 Lux, or 1 stake per day. I think their tech sounds impressive. And I like Lux. But if Verus had this, it'd be big... 
Why? I think people like being able to look, on their phone, and see it. Yeah, lol..


[10-Jan-19 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> People do like that feedback üòÉ that's why I have my staking machine email me news of new blocks...although I've been meaning to make it more of a "push" notification scenario...right now it's just a cron job every 2 hours.


[10-Jan-19 09:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> staking with the cli means I can have cron that runs ./verus commands to check for blocks etc.


[10-Jan-19 09:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> guess I could even make the emails really pretty and maybe have a really fun alert sound just for those?  like the sound the ebay app would make when you sold something (does it still do that?)


[10-Jan-19 09:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @Railrain there was no mention of VRSC staking, quoting what I was replying to "there also many MN coins,they need a vps at least,when it's under attack,you will lost everything,so MN coins is not popular any more"

[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> @miketout Yeah, people have been saying BTC is dead for years now...


[13-Jan-19 08:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @OhGodAGuardian that's not what it says. he makes the case that PoW alone is not sufficient to protect a decentralized cryptocurrency over time. Bitcoin or any other chain could evolve, except people need to recognize that pure PoW, maybe the best decentralized option 10 years ago, has weaknesses that people need to not ignore


[13-Jan-19 08:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> @miketout It's also making conclusions based on events which could not have happened if Bitcoin were larger.


[13-Jan-19 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> If it were so large, say, that Intel and Samsung were selling ASICs, they're far smarter in how they operate. Little shortsighted greedy companies like Bitmain simply would not have the ability to compete.

[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> I welcome your comment on the post thread @OhGodAGuardian


[13-Jan-19 08:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> If they want to comment on how PoW only is a race to the bottom, then in this, I agree... because it is. That's just the truth.


[13-Jan-19 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> The original model isn't exactly a weakness - it requires the token to have so much value that you have the best and brightest busting ass on more efficient ways to get at that shit. Since it didn't get big enough to attract the ringleaders - but *did* get big enough to attract the shady-ass bottom feeders like Bitmain? Yeah, this resulted.


[13-Jan-19 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I actually thing there is a problem if a crypto currency  matures and has mainly pos being the way new coins are distributed because it means that people with high amounts of coin get all the benefit of getting the new coin. It might make the incentive of mining reduced because it would probably be better to buy coins instead of mine them.


[13-Jan-19 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> @Gloryman Initial distribution. You create an impossibility - to mine coins, you must have them. The first coin to exist must be mined. üòõ

[13-Jan-19 08:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> He doesn't get how the fuckin' system is designed to work...


[13-Jan-19 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> It's not about making it totally fucking impossible to attack. It's the fact that even if you *could* attack it, you're incentivized to mine it and help secure it - because descroying it means yourimprovement to SHA-256d is now worth exactly dick.


[13-Jan-19 08:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> It uses human greed to keep people securing it rather than attempting to subvert it.


[13-Jan-19 08:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Thats a really interesting way of looking at it. I often wonder about what happens if a currency has such low incentives to mine it. Does it just fall apart?


[13-Jan-19 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yes I saw it happen to a project that claimed to convert gpu mining power into usful rendering tasks similar to golem


[13-Jan-19 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Hash just dropped to nothing. No updates anywhere and links started going bad


[13-Jan-19 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> But what about the ever expanding energy demands of pure PoW?


[13-Jan-19 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That is a flaw by design


[13-Jan-19 09:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Well at least a "brush it under the rug until it's too big to cover" solution


[13-Jan-19 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> @Gloryman Things die. It's part of life.


[13-Jan-19 09:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> The real problem I see with pure PoW is that hashrate has no loyalty at all. In a hypothetical situation with 3 big coins, not just one, that share compatible hash hardware, the current model can incentivize regular 51% attacks on every chain until their value drops to where it is pointless. The only argument that it can be sustainable, necessarily assumes one big winner, which is not what we see as the natural evolution in crypto, and in any fast moving technology, is unlikely to be a stable status quo. Pure PoS is extremely centralizing over time, and as you point out, if there is mining, the first coin needs to be mined. At least with 50/50 strengths are boosted, there is some loyalty to the system in block validation, and there is always the opportunity to contribute and earn from an outsider with work capacity rather than funds.


[13-Jan-19 09:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I like how this dynamic seems to take the strengths from each in order to address the weaknesses in either


[13-Jan-19 09:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> also all analysis of effects on 51% attacks just arbitrarily conclude that it will destroy the value of the coin. however, that is not what appears to happen. and if being 51% attacked doesnt kill the value of the coin, then all these "attacker wont destroy the value of his coins" arguments lose weight. Of course, maybe over time, it will reduce the value of coins that are constantly attacked, but now scenarios where a coin can be 51% attacked and retain value long enough for the attacker to cashout his stake exists


[13-Jan-19 09:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yeah exactly, I agree. Tha argument never made sense to me


[13-Jan-19 09:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> If the attacker cashes out, what does he care of the value of the coin? He didn't to begin with.


[13-Jan-19 09:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> It seems to me that pow has more incentives to drive the coin forward. 1. Big investors in the coin will want there to be lots of powerful miners to protect their investment and transactions. 2. Big miners will want to put work into securing the network in order to protect their investment on hardware and the currency they want to sell. 3. New casual users of the coin will use a coin with lots of people incentives to protect it. But yeah, if their is not enough incentives from time to time, then they can suffer attacks. But obviously I'm a noob in this and I'm interested in seeing how this pos works.

[13-Jan-19 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @rptr that means you likely need to rescan. you can do that by starting the daemon again, either by restarting Agama or the CLI, and when you do, if Agama, select "Activate coin" the long way and choose "daemon param: rescan" as a drop down option on native


[13-Jan-19 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> @jl777c The purpose of an attack is to gain profit - most often by stealing from an exchange via a double spend. They spend to the first exchange, then mine enough to cause a reorg in which they omit this transaction, and as such may now spend it again to another exchange. It's not only really, really likely to completely shatter trust in a coin - even if people hold it up, it's clear that the coin is not safe. The effect is pretty much catastrophic on success.

[13-Jan-19 03:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> ... well, I don't think we need to worry about solving such complex problems as decentralized finance, simply because it's clear humanity is too damned stupid to continue to survive for much longer.


[13-Jan-19 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Well.. It is a shame people don't value decentralization as much as they probably should, especially since it's what got us here to begin with but these aren't the same people here. Those ones who made it all happen aren't the ones who will abandon a project simply over what a chart says or support a centralized operation without even knowing it


[13-Jan-19 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> No, no - that's not the issue... it's so, so much worse.


[13-Jan-19 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> But I do also believe that they will be the first to scatter when things go wrong, leaving more of the true believers to refine what's left


[13-Jan-19 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> They just watched a system they're trusting with their finances just get publically defrauded to the tune of more money than they can hope to ever make... and then continue to use it, thinking it won't ever happen to them.

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I can't speak for them but it is true that this field has attracted it's fair share of unsavory folks since money became a priority over personal freedom

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That doesn't mean it will all fall apart- the benefit of a decentralized process

[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> I like this fact. I want the people who steal from others for a living trying to break it. If they succeed, we ought to know.


[13-Jan-19 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> There should be more people working toward a common mutually beneficial goal than there would be against it


[13-Jan-19 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> That's the beauty of this system... people don't have to get along nor collaborate to still be working toward the safety and security of the same system... just because they want to make money off doing so. üòõ


[13-Jan-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> If they succeed in a sense they have rewarded themselves for exploiting a flaw that shouldn't have been there. It's unfortunate that people's money have to be casualty but at the same time shouldn't they know the risks going in and the experimental nature

[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> @miketout Also, you may know this already, but I just wanna make sure you *really* get what I meant about carry-less multiply. It's basically an instruction to accelerate performing operations inside a finite field of degree 2. To give you some sort of idea... a partially-optimized multiplication inside the finite field 2^4 which I needed, I implemented in a total of 26 gates.

[13-Jan-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OhGodAGuardian> Humans simply have a lot of trouble getting along well enough to collaborate for long periods... the longer the timeframe, the more unstable the situation becomes. This bypasses the problem by causing people to independently work to the benefit of their monetary system - by leveraging their greed, which humanity could never run out of.


[13-Jan-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Not necessarily about leveraging greed, I think that‚Äôs a high accelerant of a much more balanced trade and exchange mechanism built into human nature

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Cool re posted  @John Westbrooks guide on reddit in r/gpumining and getting some good responses and inquiries if anyone wants to join in on the discussion-  <https://www.reddit.com/r/gpumining/comments/ag8az0/simple_guide_on_how_to_earn_vrsc_mining_solo_pool/>


[15-Jan-19 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Pretty cool seeing that reaction from new people. Everyone, if we all pitched in- many doing a little each can get a lot done. For example, I don't have a Twitter or Facebook but I'm sure someone out there does..


[15-Jan-19 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Got flat-out banned from ether mining without even a notice. I guess they really don't want to hear about alternatives to progpow

[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Wow crazy @Godballz but I'm also not surprised

[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Thanks for spreading the post around!


[15-Jan-19 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @John Westbrook hey yeah no problem! Thank you for all the hard work you put into it. I'm glad it's gaining traction and positive support.


[15-Jan-19 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> So I'm guessing that now, we aren't going Cryptopia lol.. Honestly, why not KuCoin?


[15-Jan-19 06:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> It's not about price, at all.
I think, being around for 6 to 7 months, we've developed a very strong & very talented community. 
At some point though, it would benefit the project, bc of the exposure. We would be on a major exchange & also be on CMC. I think these are two things that most projects do. 
This only my personal opinion. And I feel comfortable posting it here and seeing what others say, bc there are some very knowledgeable people in this discord.


[15-Jan-19 06:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I don't know that we aren't going to Cryptopia. they are busy right now, and I expected to hear from them last week. Maybe this is why I didn't. They still have the 2 BTC listing fee. We are about to post about Crypto-Bridge, who would like to list us for 2 BTC, which was the original price when we applied some time ago vs. their 3 BTC price now, and they also have CMC listing, which along with Stex, would qualify us for CMC


[15-Jan-19 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @miketout Cryptopia will probs close down after the last couple days....


[15-Jan-19 07:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> have you heard this as a rumor or from solid information?


[15-Jan-19 07:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Well we have solid information they have a significant loss to funds due to a security breach..


[15-Jan-19 07:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> saying that heaps don't recover after a breach and fund loss situation


[15-Jan-19 07:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @miketout  I'm more than willing to donate to whatever the community thinks is best, if anything. 
Honestly Mike, I do not think KuCoin is more than Crypto Bridge. If it's just a little bit, it's worth it. Bc
CryptoBridge is a DEX. It's not so easy to use.


[15-Jan-19 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ted> Crypto-Bridge......


[15-Jan-19 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> ??


[15-Jan-19 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I still don't see the point in spending $7,000 to be listed on another no name exchange when there is very little trading being done on the exchanges vrsc is already on


[15-Jan-19 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Patrick ManBearPig there is a question of both the exchange and its reach/future potential as well as CMC listing, which requires a second CMC exchange. I think it's a question for the community, and community response will likely determine the final outcome. CryptoBridge is actually interesting in light of the Cryptopia hack, as it is a dex where you keep your own keys locally.


[15-Jan-19 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I've used quite a few DEXs and they suck more than they don't. Nice in theory, poor in execution. Also, incredibly low volume


[15-Jan-19 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Idex has been the best of the ones I have used, and it's pretty much dead now


[15-Jan-19 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> It's not my money, but if it were up to me I would rather see that money spent on ways that will improve Verus. How much has already been spent on listings-- I seem to recall there have been multiple fees paid without actually getting listed, and that most of the listings that actually happened didn't even cost anything?


[15-Jan-19 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we are only waiting for Cryptopia


[15-Jan-19 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> that was the most expensive listing


[15-Jan-19 08:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> 2 BTC


[15-Jan-19 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> covered mostly by donation by the Foundation and also by broader community donations. otherwise, the foundation and community covered Stex and DP, and the Foundation gave AACoin Verus that was used for their promotion. AACoin was otherwise free and did staking


[15-Jan-19 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> ohhh so we have paid cryptopia already :L


[15-Jan-19 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> yes


[15-Jan-19 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> thats damn awkward


[15-Jan-19 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it was paid quite some time ago


[15-Jan-19 08:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Wonder how they will come out of this loss of funds. *Hope their insurance was up to date*


[15-Jan-19 08:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Wasn't there funds sent somewhere that turned out to be a spoofed email or something like that too?


[15-Jan-19 08:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Really, my only wishlist for Verus at this point is increased security of my staked coins. However that can be achieved. Encrypted wallet, or preferably hardware wallet, or some other solution


[15-Jan-19 08:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> I'm only basing my news from it from their official post. "Security Breach" Substantial loss of funds" are 2 of the things they confirmed.


[15-Jan-19 08:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I was referring to Verus sending btc somewhere for a listing but it was a scam


[15-Jan-19 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mavenL> then verus send to the real cryptopia for listing


[15-Jan-19 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mavenL> so paying twice


[15-Jan-19 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @Patrick ManBearPig  oh yeah that did happen


[15-Jan-19 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Phaelon> I've used CryptoBridge before, and it's a pain in the ass for sure.  Once i got it working, it is what it is and it's very powerful, but volume on the platform was modestly low


[15-Jan-19 10:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Phaelon> Cryptopia was a semi-active platform, so that going down the tubes is a bummer for sure.


[15-Jan-19 10:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Phaelon> CMC listing would help alot, so I'm mixed


[15-Jan-19 11:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Wow, someone just dropped a 33k vrsc order on digitalprice


[15-Jan-19 11:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Patrick ManBearPig there was a scammer that offerred 0.1 BTC for listing on Stex, which the Verus Coin Foundation, a contributing organization, but also part of the Verus community, paid and was scammed. Then, Stex came back and said they would want to list Verus, but the fee would be 1 BTC, which was partially raised by individuals the community and the rest paid by the Foundation.


[15-Jan-19 11:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> That was a lesson learned, but not a big hit for the Foundation and not the community.


[15-Jan-19 11:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Sounds like it must have been an inside job by an employee


[15-Jan-19 11:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> employee of who? are you referring to the Cryptopia hack now?


[15-Jan-19 11:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Stex employee


[15-Jan-19 11:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i don't think so


[15-Jan-19 11:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Seems far too coincidental


[15-Jan-19 11:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i got the mail from the scammer, and it was through an SMTP relay, which I didn't verify


[15-Jan-19 11:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> A scammer and the exchange both happen to contact you?


[15-Jan-19 11:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Stex didn't contact me, they responded to my reply, just not in time


[15-Jan-19 11:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> telling me that they had not had any prior contact with us


[15-Jan-19 11:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> ah ok


[15-Jan-19 11:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> and that was their actual listing fee as posted


[15-Jan-19 11:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I will list vrsc on my exchange for a low fee of 33,000 vrsc


[15-Jan-19 11:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i assume you're joking and aren't like cz_binance incognito üòÇ


[15-Jan-19 11:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Well, I don't have an exchange but if you send me that many coins I will make sure I throw one together


[15-Jan-19 11:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> sounds good. i'm sure the community will like the idea too


[15-Jan-19 11:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> It will have a strict KYC requirement which unfortunately prohibits every country, and a withdrawal fee of 1btc while I stake all the coins


[15-Jan-19 11:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> üòÇ ok, so you'll be self-sustainable from such high fees, so you'll be stable. i get it


[15-Jan-19 11:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> and with the kyc, you can take z-txes from nowhere. sounds brilliant


[15-Jan-19 11:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Think of it as a good way to test the security of staking on a VPS


[15-Jan-19 11:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Oh and don't be surprised if I get "hacked" just before tax time


[15-Jan-19 11:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> so, i guess the KYC applies only to withdrawals?


[15-Jan-19 11:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> of course


[15-Jan-19 11:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> makes sense


[15-Jan-19 11:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I actually made the mistake of depositing to an exchange or two which require kyc for withdrawals


[15-Jan-19 11:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Thankfully it was only like $10 worth of eth but I will still pissed


[15-Jan-19 11:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> really?


[15-Jan-19 11:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Granted, they don't tell you until you try to withdraw


[15-Jan-19 11:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it seems if you're going to do that, it really needs to be for deposit as well


[15-Jan-19 11:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> But then how could you steal people's funds so easily?


[15-Jan-19 11:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> just seems it shouldn't be legal that way, because yeah


[15-Jan-19 11:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> There are many many many bullshit exchanges out there.


[15-Jan-19 11:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I made the deposit to do some quick arbitrage, then the order book wouldn't even work. Kept trying to place buy orders and it wouldn't fill. Then tried to withdraw the eth and it hit me with the kyc requirement


[15-Jan-19 11:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> there are, and some that are just good and trying to make it work. Cryptopia's event isn't going to make things easier


[15-Jan-19 11:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I'm glad DP turned out to be a solid, small exchange


[15-Jan-19 11:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> So far I have had good experience with them


[16-Jan-19 12:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> and AACoin with staking is great. i just wish they had a way to earn more trust in the market


[16-Jan-19 12:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> very hard to trust an unknown CEX


[16-Jan-19 12:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> and very hard to earn trust as one


[16-Jan-19 12:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> They could hire me to proofread their siteüòé


[16-Jan-19 12:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> üòÑ you should ask them


[16-Jan-19 12:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I feel like something has to pop with vrsc trading soon. The order books are the fullest I have seen but with the lowest volume of trades


[16-Jan-19 02:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> I have nothing against AACoin, but with yet another Exchange having been  hacked(Cryptopia) I still wouldn't recommend anyone leaving funds on a Exchange after filling buy/ask orders.


[16-Jan-19 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> AAcoin withdrawals take far too long


[16-Jan-19 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I am concluding my informal experiment with staking on there and putting everything back in my vps. As scary as that is too


[16-Jan-19 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @zpajk problem is that making lots of withdrawals can rack up some big fees.


[16-Jan-19 02:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> vrsc withdrawal fee is .01. Someday that might be a significant amount but right now it is not


[16-Jan-19 03:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> @Gloryman In the eyes of the beholder. Risk vs reward.

[16-Jan-19 04:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Patrick ManBearPig  You said you feel like something needs to pop and we need volume, but getting on another exchange is a waste of money. There's a reason that most projects are on major exchanges--exposure. This community can only buy so much Verus. And we can only grow, so fast, if the community does not know who we are.


[16-Jan-19 05:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <yaheardme> @Cruz  I'm pretty sure Kucoin was trying to force certain coins to up their volume by any "means" necesarry in the downtrend. They delisted rdn which shortly after launched mainnet and ran for +50%. So I believe places like Kucoin could be a double edge sword.


[16-Jan-19 05:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @yaheardme What do you think would be a better option?


[16-Jan-19 05:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <yaheardme> @Cruz  Not fully sure in these market conditions, but I don't think there is anything wrong with moving slow in regards to listing on bigger exchanges. I do think places like bittrex is far more reputable than say kucoin.


[16-Jan-19 05:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @miketout  IDEX listing is free


[16-Jan-19 05:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Are those all cmc?


[16-Jan-19 05:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Yeah


[16-Jan-19 05:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Well the free one wouldn't hurt would it?


[16-Jan-19 05:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> CryptoBridge is a Dex..
So is IDEX..
It's well known too


[16-Jan-19 05:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Their volume was very high from like June-August last year. They are known for listing projects right out of ICO


[16-Jan-19 05:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Free is good


[16-Jan-19 05:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I think the purpose of being on CMC is about the same as, announcing projects on Bitcointalk, it's a standard within the community.


[16-Jan-19 05:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Outdated, yes. But that's what everyone goes by.


[16-Jan-19 05:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yeah so if idex is free and they can get us on cmc, what's the harm in trying to get on there? If cmc is the main goal. Unless it's more the combination of getting on cmc along with having the additional exposure and user base of their community.


[16-Jan-19 05:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <yaheardme> Any thoughts on blockfolio signal? It could help with a little bit of exposure, I know personally a handful of friends who use the app.


[16-Jan-19 05:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ph03nix> i believe IDEX is only for erc-20 tokens


[16-Jan-19 05:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @yaheardme would you feel like reaching out to them by chance? I could look for a contact when I get home later if not

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I have been thinking about it a lot lately and where so many projects do have big ad campaigns and where we are currently a somewhat smaller community coin, it's only up to us to do as much as we can for the project because anything you or I do is beneficial to each and every one of us and in that same way, anything that the community does to better itself benefits you and me just the same. We each hold coins and we understand how much more technologically advanced Verus is compared to so many of the larger flawed coins. Any effort that goes in adds value and that is good for us all


[16-Jan-19 06:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> No pressure haha but where I dont have certain social media apps and others may, together we can be a mighty force of an ad campaign


[16-Jan-19 06:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <yaheardme> I am looking at the app currently and under VRSC it says "token team" can contact them. When I click on that it asks for who will be allowed to post on behalf of the team ect ect.


[16-Jan-19 06:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yeah I ran into that as well


[16-Jan-19 06:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Mike said that because it's a community project that there is no official "team" and that if its beneficial the the community that one of us could act in that capacity for that purpose. I'm sure if you run into a spot where you get stuck someone will help


[16-Jan-19 06:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @ph03nix you're right


[16-Jan-19 06:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I don't think IDEX can do anything that isn't an erc20 token though?


[16-Jan-19 06:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Patrick ManBearPig you're right


[16-Jan-19 06:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I just feel like we went over all of this several months ago


[16-Jan-19 06:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Oh I just saw someone said that


[16-Jan-19 06:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> If you wanna try getting as far as you can maybe someone who knows more could take over. I can try too later


[16-Jan-19 06:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> "You said you feel like something needs to pop and we need volume"

That's not really what I wrote though, @Cruz


[16-Jan-19 06:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> The charts do look rather loaded tbh


[16-Jan-19 06:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I feel like something has to pop with vrsc trading soon. The order books are the fullest I have seen but with the lowest volume of trades


[16-Jan-19 06:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> More than they have in a while


[16-Jan-19 06:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Sorry I didn't mean to misquote you


[16-Jan-19 06:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> What I meant is that the order books on the exchanges are getting pretty stacked, but few trades are taking place so it would seem like something will break out one way or the other


[16-Jan-19 06:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I have not seen as many orders on the books as I am now. Especially on dp


[16-Jan-19 06:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Stex is pretty dead though


[16-Jan-19 06:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> This is my only point.
I think the purpose of being on CMC is about the same as, announcing projects on Bitcointalk, it's a standard within the community.


[16-Jan-19 06:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I don't care about the price


[16-Jan-19 06:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> being on cmc is good. Being on a bunch of shittier exchanges though might not be so good


[16-Jan-19 06:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> people will judge that


[16-Jan-19 06:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> You just need to get on one where you can get on CMC


[16-Jan-19 06:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Unfortunately, that requires to be listed on an exchange that charges for a listing


[16-Jan-19 06:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> It's a funny system


[16-Jan-19 06:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Cruz I agree, it's best to get on as many exchanges for as little as possible


[16-Jan-19 06:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Gloryman Well there's no point to be on exchanges that have no volume


[16-Jan-19 06:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Well, now that Gloryman has chimed in we all know the solution


[16-Jan-19 06:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Lol


[16-Jan-19 06:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> It's been settled


[16-Jan-19 06:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I'm kidding. Good morning to everyone


[16-Jan-19 06:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> What about Korean exchanges?


[16-Jan-19 06:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Or something like Gate.io?


[16-Jan-19 06:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Kyc


[16-Jan-19 06:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> No US residents can use them


[16-Jan-19 06:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> so?


[16-Jan-19 06:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> True


[16-Jan-19 06:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Let's look into it


[16-Jan-19 06:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> If the goal is to get on an exchange which is on cmc then that doesn't matter, and it opens up other markets


[16-Jan-19 06:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Patrick ManBearPig  Now you're talking


[16-Jan-19 06:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> A lot of people visit CMC and look at the Recently Added


[16-Jan-19 06:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> A lot


[16-Jan-19 06:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> And they do it daily


[16-Jan-19 06:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Any other exchanges come to mind?


[16-Jan-19 06:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> There are quite a few basically captive markets which foreigners can't touch-- Japan, Korea are two


[16-Jan-19 06:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Huobi, OKEX are both pretty big?


[16-Jan-19 06:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> There are plenty of questionable exchanges... fcoin, fatbtc(pretty shitty, but I've made some loot from it), bitforex


[16-Jan-19 06:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> COSS could be an option but I kind of hate them. They have such a hard time dealing with anything which isn't erc20


[16-Jan-19 06:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> pretty xead

[16-Jan-19 06:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I used to love them till they booted US citizens and required kyc


[16-Jan-19 06:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> no trading fees

[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I can't remember the other one though


[16-Jan-19 06:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I've only traded on Bitso


[16-Jan-19 06:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I kind of miss Bitso. It's pretty great. Deposit cash at any convenience store 24/7, and seconds later buy crypto.


[16-Jan-19 06:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Hell, I paid my rent with that exchange too


[16-Jan-19 06:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Originally yeah but I haven't lived there for a couple years


[16-Jan-19 06:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Kind of pointless if you aren't dealing in MXN though


[16-Jan-19 06:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I'm actually going to delete my comments back to the original one about CMC

[dscrdvrsc] <hellcatz> I don't use Crypto-Bridge exchange, but I'll donate a little to help get VerusCoin listed on more exchanges!


[16-Jan-19 09:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> I began using it back in October, I'm really trying to use more DEX's in general and they are a pretty cool one...and with cmc and ease of use it could help get VRSC listed on cmc imo


[16-Jan-19 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hellcatz> I havent really used any exchange since 2017 üòÇ

[16-Jan-19 09:56 AM] Gateway#3763

[16-Jan-19 10:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> So exciting! Lots of new potential listings, if we all seek out and apply I think together we can get sooo much done!


[16-Jan-19 10:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yeah I haven't sold a single red VerusCoin since I started. In fact I sold most of my alts for Verus


[16-Jan-19 10:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> The question in 2019 isn't When Binance?, It's When Verus?

Best of Luck guys! 
Thanks for all you've done to date to  benefit our project!  ‚ù§


[16-Jan-19 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Thank you again @FishyGuts and @hellcatz as well, awesome.  I'm donating now as well ‚ù§


[16-Jan-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ABK> COSS is looking decent again after the recent upgrade, could be a good option. Otherwise going to pop some money towards the Crypto Bridge listing... Don‚Äôt have a lot but every bit helps I suppose


[16-Jan-19 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> thank you @ABK don't know how it will go, but with ARRR being on CB and their idea of co-announcing and getting z-transaction support, we are asking for that as well. I think it would be a pretty big deal to have a DEX supporting z-txs as well. Like I said, this was not part of their original offer, but it can't hurt to ask. Thanks to @FishyGuts of Pirate for the support and idea!


[16-Jan-19 01:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chazmainian Devil> CB is awesome!!!  Exactly 1 year ago I had a bad experience with Craptopia when they took all trading pairs for coins besides BTC down for three months. Shady.. plus rumors about what they do with POS and MN coins -- They would stake all the coins under the one wallet for the coin... and not remove them from staking till someone physically move the coins off the exchange. That can have evil effects on a POS coin. How decentralized is that anyways? If you are a POS or MN coin you are better off sticking to DEX's where that trick is not possible.  Good decision there!! Go VERUS! üòÉ


[16-Jan-19 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @FishyGuts @miketout thanks and great ideas! Exciting stuff! So donations are open now?


[16-Jan-19 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chazmainian Devil> Wouldn't hurt to ask Cryptopia for a partial refund on their listing fee and also get delisted off of it..Because of what I mentioned above with staking... Taking what you get back, add it to CB funding and disassociate  Verus from Cryptopia completely.  What Cryptopia had happen is not what a new coin wants happening from the start.  Stick with the DEX's  P2P is what it always should have been.


[16-Jan-19 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Chazmainian Devil that is a shame and an interesting point, I never really considered that- large exchanges staking for the coins they hold. I wonder if it would have a large centralizing effect for the larger exchanges


[16-Jan-19 02:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chazmainian Devil> Most definitely!   Think about how long people have coins on those exchanges and not in their wallet??? Yikes! Murder for staking coins.


[16-Jan-19 02:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> It would be nice if cryptopia did issue some sort of refund for the deposit but I would be really surprised if that happened and I wouldn't hold my breath for it. Like you said I guess it wouldn't really hurt


[16-Jan-19 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Chazmainian Devil any idea how many coins are on digital price at any given time? Cryptopia is much larger so I can imagine. This is the first time I've heard that brought up though but it doesn't not make sense


[16-Jan-19 02:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chazmainian Devil> Yes, doesn't hurt to try to get the fee back but also would be a BIG plus if VERUS was only listed on P2P or DEX exchanges.  All listing a POS coin on a non-P2P exchange does  is devalue the staking coin and centralize it at the same time. All the coins they make is pure profit...and you then can imagine what they could do with price manipulation or when they "Sell" all of those staked coins.


[16-Jan-19 02:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yes but at the same time it shouldn't be that massive in the scheme of things, like the max amount they'd ever have would have to be a really huge amount staking against the full current total supply to have a centralizing effect


[16-Jan-19 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Godballz  Good point


[16-Jan-19 02:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I'll contribute. 
Do we still need to be approved?


[16-Jan-19 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Cruz Thanks dude. Me too, count me in as well. I think it would be nice and a good step forward to push the cmc thing


[16-Jan-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Godballz  It will bring more people here, a lot. And I'm sure some will be talented & will want to contribute. In my opinion, exchanges have been the financial winners in crypto, up to date. And it's bs that DP isn't on CMC.


[16-Jan-19 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I mean either way I stand behind a listing that will benefit us in the bigger picture and cmc seems to be able to help there so if specifics aren't a huge issue then I'm not too particular, personally


[16-Jan-19 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chazmainian Devil> @Godballz , it can be major to a new coin that is only listed or first listed on a non DEX...I've seen it happen multiple times now. Besides, it's not like you would be able to prove anything like how much is on a wallet thru block explorer that was actually staking. Especially with this coin.


[16-Jan-19 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Well you can't stake from a private address so it should show up on the Block Explorer but that could always be broken down into smaller addresses but I'm not disagreeing I definitely think that's worth considering at least


[16-Jan-19 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'm not sure which Exchange is being leaned towards or what the best reasons for choosing one would be. I imagine it would be important to have a good-sized one with exposure rather than a no-name one obviously but if the end goal is CMC then it shouldn't matter so much right? And in that case any qualifying one should do


[16-Jan-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> So if that's the only reason and the cheaper or free one would be a good option but if that's not the only reason and I would guess that it's always better to have multiple reasons then it might be better to pay the fee and go for the bigger one but if there are free options I guess more than one choice is also possible


[16-Jan-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Godballz  Maybe I'm getting you confused with someone. What is your most recent Medium article?


[16-Jan-19 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chazmainian Devil> Consider DEX only. All you would see in block explorer is small addresses from 500-1000 coins which are called nodes in the Staking world.  On non-DEX exchanges you would have to add all the coins on the exchange up for Sell orders to understand the size of their wallet in coins that they could potentially stake.  Bigger non-Dex  exchange you get the worse it gets and the faster the coin is devalued.  DEX only please!!! üòÉ  I forgot that you also have to add all of the coins on the exchange that do not have a sell order on them too... See how bad the situation snowballs on Non-DEX?


[16-Jan-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Non-DEX it is


[16-Jan-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chazmainian Devil> LOL!


[16-Jan-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Jk


[16-Jan-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Haha


[16-Jan-19 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I would guess exchanges make more from trading fees than they do from any kind of staking conspiracy, but who knows


[16-Jan-19 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> @ABK It's hard to endorse coss when everytime I try to transfer to or from there I basically have to consult a psychic hotline and hope that it shows up in a reasonable time frame or without needing to open a bunch of tickets


[17-Jan-19 01:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Patrick ManBearPig  haha that sounds reliable.. and @Cruz since you asked, the Medium  link is- <https://link.medium.com/X19zhgljjT> but the reddit link has a bit more added info too- <https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/afj7ae/the_problem_with_pow/> also a different post that briefly explains Verus , meant to catch people's eye and draw them in, in order to simply get the word out in case anyone wants to share or create a similar post to help spread the word- <https://www.reddit.com/r/gpumining/comments/afgs37/fixing_pow_for_miners_pos_just_wasnt_enough_for/>


[17-Jan-19 01:14 AM] Gateway#3763

We are all paranoid about¬†losing our cryptocurrencies to theft on centralized exchanges. Aren't we? That fear makes us look for¬†safer and secure cryptocurrency exchanges. Now, we all know that centralized cryptocurrency exchanges are good but not the best when it comes to s...

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> According to one of the comments below and from what I'm reading about now, it seems- "For now Crypto-bridge is the most active decentralize exchange that we can use. There are few others but they don‚Äôt have so much volume." So crypto-bridge doesn't look so bad it seems. Are there any pros and cons to these DEXs that anyone is aware of, or anyone familiar with some of these platforms?


[17-Jan-19 02:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Godballz  In the past, I know IDEX had issues with the exchange being unable to handle high amounts of traffic. And just in general, it's just a little different than using a traditional exchange. Everything has advantages & disadvantages.

On Sunday, Bitcoin Cash (BCH) developer Jonathan Toomim unveiled a project he‚Äôs been working on called Xthinner, a new block propagation protocol that Xthinner can compress blocks by 99.6 percent and performs roughly 4x to 6x more efficiently than block propagation concepts...

[dscrdvrsc] <Ted> what do you guys think about that?


[17-Jan-19 05:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i think, in addition to HODL, LOTR will be a thing soon, too.

[dscrdvrsc] <Ted> üòÇ


[17-Jan-19 05:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> the literal claim in the headline is a bit bold tho


[17-Jan-19 05:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> If it's true then that is pretty impressive. So technically it's not for bch? Looks like he is working toward making a whole new chain


[17-Jan-19 05:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I feel like that is more off-topicish though


[17-Jan-19 06:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> btw devs stop dumping your coin so much


[17-Jan-19 06:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> we know you are mining close to 50% of everything and you have been from the get go


[17-Jan-19 06:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> hence thats why you switched again to CPU algo, since you or your pals own or have access to server rooms


[17-Jan-19 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> not sure if its that relevant now, cause i dont know how well optimised its on GPUs but still i suspect you dump major chunks


[17-Jan-19 07:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Wolf0> @rptr Er... unfounded accusation, really. You could *always* make the accusation the devs chose the PoW due to having some sort of advantage, and it's impossible for them to disprove.


[17-Jan-19 07:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Wolf0> The burden of proof is on YOU.


[17-Jan-19 07:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> no, compared to putting up accusations, that would require actual work to be done.


[17-Jan-19 07:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03>


[17-Jan-19 07:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cryptonoobie> I‚Äôm banking on a MN coin that should have a DEX out soon.  Keeping my fingers crossed.  Hope no one else here lost anything on CT.  I lost a little bit but nothing too important.


[17-Jan-19 07:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Wolf0> @0x03 Then it's about as credible as any random, unsubstantiated trash you might read on the net. Background noise.


[17-Jan-19 07:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I love all the hysterical claims made here, despite them not being born out by any evidence... like trading activity or anything


[17-Jan-19 07:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Last month it was "FPGA miners crashed the price 7 billion percent since they started!!"


[17-Jan-19 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> @Wolf0  actually i was here from launch, so i know my share of first hand information and talked to certain people enought to know


[17-Jan-19 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> its up to you whether you believe or not im not gonna fud


[17-Jan-19 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Wolf0> @rptr I can make declarative statements too. "Some dude told me..." is not evidence, nor is it even reasonable suspicion. It's called a cop-out.


[17-Jan-19 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> would be nice if (lets call it "these people") these people stopped dumping the fuck out of this coin


[17-Jan-19 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> i dont want to fud here or anything


[17-Jan-19 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> i wanna keep it civil


[17-Jan-19 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Wolf0> I believe they call accusations with zero evidence or justification "defamation of character", or something. Not that you'll be sued, just pointing out it's not a nice thing to do. üòõ


[17-Jan-19 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> well, like I said, I dont benefit from fudding here, so I need not to convince anybody here about what i said.

[17-Jan-19 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Wolf0> Oh, and I suppose I should just trust you on that?


[17-Jan-19 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> there you have one dude "block-miner"


[17-Jan-19 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> that guy with virgin account mined like 25%+ of coins first month or so


[17-Jan-19 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> i believe there was another one or two big guys that came, as it seems like they been here just for this coin, with vanilla accounts


[17-Jan-19 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Wolf0> And could be anyone here - even you.


[17-Jan-19 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Wolf0> Motive would be - dump, spread FUD to drop it more, and buy back.


[17-Jan-19 08:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> well believe whatever you want, these people were devs, their pals or actually whatever but they took way more than its healthy for any crypto environment


[17-Jan-19 08:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> 90% devs or their pals tho


[17-Jan-19 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> anyway cheers i could be wrong im not here to fud, but raises concerns to me at all times


[17-Jan-19 08:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> dropping in out of nowhere with loads of fud isn't exactly "keeping it civil" @rptr


[17-Jan-19 08:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> I'm not seeing anything productive or contributive from you.  Spreading fud is not in any way helpful to the community.


[17-Jan-19 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> i was saing the same thing before


[17-Jan-19 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> its not that its something i just figured out


[17-Jan-19 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> If you want to have a constructive discussion, you'd be coming in with a different approach.


[17-Jan-19 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Right now, all I see from you is totally the opposite.


[17-Jan-19 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> well however it is, im sure you wont admit anything. So it cannot be constructive I wanted to say you or "maybe not you" could use some limit with the dumping


[17-Jan-19 08:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @rptr  Do you have any proof?


[17-Jan-19 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> I'm just asking that you stop the fud.  Personally I have not sold any VRSC in months and don't intend to for quite some time...and having lived on day trading in my past I know a thing or two about irresponsible dumping of small coins and take it seriously in general...but even moreso when it comes to a project in which I have a strong love for and belief in...as I'm sure many other community members here do as well.  Especially those who are here for the long run, contribute regularly to the project, etc.  If I were to look at it logically and make any unsubstantiated claims, it would make more sense to assume someone without a vested interest in and who doesn't contribute to the project's success would be dumping and potentially fudding the community to create ideal dump scenarios.


[17-Jan-19 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> Ok i respect it, I stop right here.


[17-Jan-19 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Thank you.


[17-Jan-19 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ted> @rptr üôÑ


[18-Jan-19 02:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Where is this dumping taking place? And when? There is hardly any volume of trading going on. Why is it always people with hardly any stakes at play being the loudest fudders here?


[18-Jan-19 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> I don't mind those fudders since they are so obvious. Now if someone with two parts of a brain did some research and made an effort they might be able to do some damage, but I have faith in the community calling out stuff like that.


[18-Jan-19 03:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I just want to say that I hate fud more than anyone on this discord.


[18-Jan-19 10:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <idrtis> if you arent thinking of selling now, current price doesnt matter. fud/selling is healthy, let people dump. more people would own part of supply. it would be stronger when it rises.

v0.5.0 I get an error message about electrum server: "sheperdelectrumsendpromise" 
this comes up when I try to send, or try to claim reward


[18-Jan-19 10:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <nick cloudpost> guys, do you know that crypto bridge now charges additional fee for wallet updates?


[18-Jan-19 10:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <nick cloudpost> I hold another coin and they are delisting from bridge because they charge smth like 0.25 BTC for wallet upgrade


[18-Jan-19 11:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @nick cloudpost what coin is that buddy


[18-Jan-19 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> At risk of sending negative vibes, but that sounds like a deal-breaker in my ears, IF it‚Äôs true. On a positive note, I‚Äôd like submitting a listing query to TradeOgre, preferably by someone good with words. üòÉ


[18-Jan-19 11:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> But does the community think we should get the coin listed if they are going to keep milking the coin with unexpected fees?


[18-Jan-19 11:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> should probably be verified before further discussion of alternatives.  Never good to make decisions on incomplete information I think.


[18-Jan-19 12:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <nick cloudpost> "Also SUQA is out.
"SUQA is getting delisted on Cryptobridge in 2 weeks because we will have 2 mandatory wallet upgrades first one at the end of this month and the second one Late March Hard-Fork time. CB is asking 0.5 btc for each upgrade while there is no volume there so we decided to get delisted from Cryptobridge on our own! Please send your SUQA funds to TradeOgre, Coinexchange or Stex!""


[18-Jan-19 12:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <nick cloudpost> I'm holding a bit of Credits (CRDS) - argon2d CPU coin, they will delist from bridge, I think such fees are rediculous


[18-Jan-19 12:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <nick cloudpost> maybe nowadays some upgrades are included in initial listing fee, but you need to verify that


[18-Jan-19 12:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> is it depending on trade volume?


[18-Jan-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @ver_User I believe 0.5.0 stopped working on the Sapling-upgrade with other Komodo coins. You would need to upgrade to the latest, which works fine.

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> If anyone wants to pop by CPUminersclub's discord to represent verus in the verus section down the bottom, they might move us back up top and it could be a great place to attract new CPU miners who otherwise might not have heard of us. I'll post a reminder in a day or two but details are in the marketing section here if anyone wants to show support or post helpful links or even just to say hi! üòÄ

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Would anybody be interested in doing a competition designing the best bumper sticker on stickeryou.com? Perhaps we could all put 50 vrsc into a neutral wallet and pick the winner by vote so it's fair and fun and wouldn't cost the foundation anything!?!?


[18-Jan-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Or as @Thoskk just thought of- the vrsc in the pot could be used to make the stickers to pass out to everyone!  I love that idea because everyone is a winner!!!


[18-Jan-19 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I guess it doesn't have to be specific to that website so long as it's a sticker


[18-Jan-19 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> If this gains traction I'll get working right away on a legit one


[18-Jan-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> yeah I think the idea of @Godballz is worth considering, and the community here is definetly the right one to join


[18-Jan-19 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Hey!  @Thoskk thought of the coolest part where the pot goes toward winning stickers for everyone instead of just the winner. Perfect community prize come up with in a perfectly community way!

[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Godballz  @Thoskk   I would enter that competition

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Cruz awesome! So far a good start! This could be a lot of fun for everyone to participate in and for everyone to also be winners!

[18-Jan-19 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763

[18-Jan-19 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763

[19-Jan-19 01:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> On the issue of Cryptobridge... I would say dance with who brung you. DigitalPrice will be added to CMC at some point, and adding vrsc to more exchanges which are not well known or used, I don't see as benefiting the project. I stand by my initial reaction that there are better uses for 2 bitcoin.


[19-Jan-19 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <basti> @Patrick ManBearPig What would you suggest to do with the btc?


[19-Jan-19 02:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I was going to ask the same question. Digital price is good. I have hand no problems using it. Also, if Crypto Union comes out making fiat a smooth transition, then I am really happy about this. But,  we do need to encourage users as quickly as possible or we might find that another coin (unknown as yet) with a similar application of verus becomes more popular.


[19-Jan-19 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> When Verus was announced, it was done so on Bitcointalk. That's the standard. When you go to find the price & price history on CMC, you can't find it. 
People expect it to be on CMC and there's a level of trust, that comes with that.

Maybe it's just me--and I know a few btc is a lot, it really is. But, in some, way, shape or form---most other projects have paid many times over that, for listings..


[19-Jan-19 03:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I think the community needs to grow. 
And in order to do that, we need exposure.
It's about time more of the crypto community starts to know who Verus is


[19-Jan-19 03:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Cruz agreed. Exposure is key now


[19-Jan-19 03:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> @Patrick ManBearPig , i tend to agree with you. I as well think there might be better exchanges. But than again, we should know which exchanges wants how much listing fee exactly to compare if crypto-bridge is a good deal or not.


[19-Jan-19 03:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> We can only pick the exchanges that are available to us. This is the biggest decentralised exchange as I understand it. Also, I believe the more is better principle, as long as it is at a reasonable price. Getting on two big exchanges reasonably quickly will be a huge benefit to us.

[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> Not always more is better, it should be a good reputation exchange as well. For example i personally would avoid at all costs exchanges like mercatox, livecoin, yobit und fake volume exchanges like Lbank and similars. But than again, that's just me. ....


[19-Jan-19 03:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> Just our of curiousity, what is the listing fee, if there is any at all, on dex exchanges like tradeorgre for example?


[19-Jan-19 03:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> I think, getting listed on an exchange is one thing, but keeping the necessary volume to stay listed is the other.  So, if it can't be made sure to keep the minimum trade volume, we might end up as many other coins. 
I also think, getting listed on CMC would be really helpful, because it's kind of the standard  dictionary and who-is-who in things of cryptos.


[19-Jan-19 03:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Thoskk do you have a CMC link please. I'm a bit of a newbie


[19-Jan-19 03:27 AM] Gateway#3763

[19-Jan-19 03:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> I‚Äôm getting a bit repetitive, but a free Exchange is TradeOgre. They were also quick to set up Grin, but I haven‚Äôt tested that market myself. TradeOgre are on CMC.


[19-Jan-19 03:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> It seems we are getting a solid 200,000 VRSC on DP. Do you this is enough to keep the listing?


[19-Jan-19 03:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @zpajk sounds like a great idea


[19-Jan-19 03:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @zpajk Then I think this is worth considering. I'm not an expert in things of exchanges and which are the best, I must admit. I'm just a hodler who plays with a few coins from time to time üòÑ


[19-Jan-19 03:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> They have a free listing form. I haven‚Äôt done it because one requirement is to explain why the coin should be listed. And I‚Äôm not very good with words.


[19-Jan-19 03:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> Has anybody from the community done this yet? I'm not a native speaker, too. But I think there is a lot of material in @John Westbrook  posts and PR moves. It appears to me that he's a real pro in such things.


[19-Jan-19 03:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> yeah i think this looks like good volume

[19-Jan-19 03:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> only a bit lower than crypto bridge


[19-Jan-19 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> Tradeogre is as well a very easy to use exchange by the way with perfect reputation as i know. This can not be said about many smaller exchanges. I think this would be a good start in my opinion, if it's free, even better.....


[19-Jan-19 03:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> sorry for noob question, but is TradeOgre a DEX?


[19-Jan-19 03:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> yes


[19-Jan-19 03:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> no KYC required


[19-Jan-19 03:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> great, so that would add to security


[19-Jan-19 03:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> So, from all I can tell about crypto (though that is not too much), TradeOgre would be my favourite choice.


[19-Jan-19 03:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> trade ogre isn't a big volume exchange, but it is a reliable excahnge for the user as well. Payouts and Deposits are done very quick there, volume is real, no KYC, and one of the most easy to use exchanges, especially for newbies. As a starter exchange i really recommend it and i'am unbiased here. Writing this as someone have accounts on about 60 exchanges.....


[19-Jan-19 03:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> So you have plenty of experience. I only have about 6 accounts on exchanges, but it's already too much for my taste.  However, that's not about my taste here.


[19-Jan-19 03:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> One more thing i would like to share for future listings, especially at the beginning. When i go through coinmarketcap sites and investigate a given coin and see exchanges like livecoin, yobit, mercatox as their main exchanges i just move ahead. These exchanges are mass involved in dump/pump shemes and scams. Just a point to think about that not ALWAYS more is better.


[19-Jan-19 03:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> yes, totally agree


[19-Jan-19 03:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> something to aim at would be cryptopia, enough they recover from the hack occured some days ago. This exchange went from a suspect and shaddy one to a real good one after they made about 1 year ago changes to the people in charge there. It's one of the top exchanges for newbie traders and people new to crypto due the easyness it provides. Just another thought where to begin with ...... Beside exchanges like crypto-brige, crex24 and maybe stex.....


[19-Jan-19 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> I don't know Cryptopia, just think they may need quite some time to recover, even in terms of if the funds are safe now. I started right away on Binance, which I still think is one of the best, and even better now as they are starting to implement fiat. 
But let's see if there are any objections from other people in here.  There are so many members, and only a few are discussing this.


[19-Jan-19 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> I wonder why there is no #poll channel. Is it by intention, or was there just no need for it?


[19-Jan-19 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> No doubt that binance would be top notch. Wasn't aware we are aiming directly that high....


[19-Jan-19 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> dind't mean that, just wanted to shed some light on my humble experience here ^^


[19-Jan-19 03:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> if i remember right and from some rumours some weeks back the listing fee for exchanges like bittrex or binance was in the range of 30+ BTC. As said, if i remember right, no garantee it's like that!!!


[19-Jan-19 03:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @boxalex cryptopia and many other big exchanges has pump and dump squads.


[19-Jan-19 03:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> I bet they **are** expensive, yes.


[19-Jan-19 03:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @boxalex cryptopia has already been agreed and we should be on there after they sort their hacking thing out.


[19-Jan-19 03:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> even better than. Pretty sure they recover.


[19-Jan-19 03:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @Gloryman  Though doesn't mean we can't go for both if listing on TradeOgre doesn't cost except a good argumentation, I think.


[19-Jan-19 03:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> well, gotta do some housekeeping now, see you later guys


[19-Jan-19 04:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> of course, the more reputable exchanges the better, no doubt here.


[19-Jan-19 04:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @Thoskk I agree. Like I said above, more is the answer

[19-Jan-19 05:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> @basti  *IF* funds are to be spent on getting listed, then in my opinion they would be better served being saved up to a point where a brand name exchange can be obtained. Every project needs to start somewhere, so I think people will accept being listed on a handful of lesser known/sketchy exchanges. As @boxalex mentioned though, at some point I think it starts acting against a projects reputation if someone goes on CMC and it is carried on too many of these less reputable exchanges. 

I have pointed out previously that gate.io does not charge for listings. I am sure there are a number of others. That said-- At this point, I would think the next move or two would be aiming to be listed on an upper-level exchange. 

Eventually, DP or AAcoin will likely be listed on CMC as well. Stex already is. So that would seem to meet the CMC requirement once they are.


[19-Jan-19 05:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> That said, I have not and am not able to donate to the fund so take my opinion for what it's worth


[19-Jan-19 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ratta> tradeogre is cool. loads of gems there. it's no DEX though. and its operated anonymously afaik. be careful with keeping coins there


[19-Jan-19 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ratta> Often the first exchange to list new cool coins. Fairly low volume

[19-Jan-19 12:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I'm taking the position I've been taking, for two reasons. One, CMC is like what the Phone Book or the Yellow Pages used to be, for a person or a business. It gives a sense of legitimacy, for people that want that type of reasurrance.
And two, I'm not sure how long it will be before the Verus Vision is completed, or the base is finished. Because Mike & the dev team, are very very good and they do work fast. So wouldn't it be better to address some of these basic things now, rather than later?


[19-Jan-19 12:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I dislike CMC. But it serves a purpose.
I prefer OnChainFX. 
But it'll take time to move away from CMC


[19-Jan-19 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> what makes you think getting on CMC is not something that is being worked on? adding a CMC exchange is exactly what is needed, isnt it?


[19-Jan-19 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @jl777c  I never said it wasn't. I dont think I'm being  overly critical, by bringing  it up. We have  been trying since October,. We chose Cryptopia over Crypto Bridge and what happen with that, i don't know. But we all know what happened with the exchange recently. 

I do understand that I don't know everything that is going on.


[19-Jan-19 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> Not that it matters. I'm only a community member. The project will decide to do what it thinks, is in its best interest.


[19-Jan-19 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Cruz what do you mean, "only a community member"? this is a community coin, and while some people, like me and others may work full time on it, we are members of the community. if someone in the community has ideas that they believe are good for the project, or want to improve something that has community support, then they can do so, often with some support of the Verus Coin Foundation. I don't know what your position is that you are referring to, because though I've read a number of your posts recently, I haven't yet understood a specific thing you are suggesting that people do, although my read on your posts leads me to think it may be contrary to what the community is doing.


[19-Jan-19 05:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Godballz @Thoskk Devs are often available here, and we usually have mods around the Discord. Is that not enough? It seems more than most projects I had experience with prior to Verus.


[19-Jan-19 06:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @miketout No complaints. I think everyone around here is extremely responsive and helpful to one another.
We were just talking about how Verus was moved up and out of the "unloved" category. It was more a celebratory thing, but as Thoskk pointed out we are now in "purgatory", which is apparently another category, I think above "unloved". I'm still a bit confused about how they do things over there.


[19-Jan-19 07:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Godballz I understood. i was referring to the rules above and wondering if we thought that somehow we didn't qualify üòÉ


[19-Jan-19 07:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Haha ok then that was my misunderstanding. Yeah not sure what else they'd want, a bit odd. Like is every one supposed to pop in and if so what is the maximum allowed time intervals in between visits?


[19-Jan-19 11:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike_O.> Does anyone have a large file of the verus logo they can send me?

[19-Jan-19 11:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike_O.> Or I can just get some going of the basic logo. Are you talking screen printed vinyl or just any kind of weatherproof/uv resistant vinyl.


[19-Jan-19 11:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> I remember that, but has anyone actually made any?


[19-Jan-19 11:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> weatherproof. Like i have had some laser cut  stickers made in the past


[19-Jan-19 11:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> Like the kind on car windows


[19-Jan-19 11:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I think it'd take some organization if any funds are involved. Wouldn't really wanna be responsible. But it'd be fun to make some and I'd be happy to do some just to mess around. If someone better organized would want to do that in a somewhat safe way I'd be happy to participate.


[19-Jan-19 11:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> Ill just straight pay someone for some...ha


[19-Jan-19 11:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> not as fun as a contest tho


[19-Jan-19 11:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike_O.> Aye. Well in that realm of thought its easier for me to do Pirate/KMD/Verus stuff all at the same time. Shipping takes a lot of ... attention. Its easier for me to switch to that mode for abit from prodcution or orders.


[19-Jan-19 11:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mike_O.> I dont see why we cant do both. Honestly we can get sheets of multiple designs too which might be a fun end result to a contest.

John posted this link to logos about a week ago. I guess the svg version is vector so it can be scaled for high rez in any size.
I like the idea of a sticker contest or just have people maybe come up with a bunch of ideas and make something together. I might have a go at it and play around with the logo and some ideas during the week ahead.

[20-Jan-19 11:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Phaelon> If you read the article, that's no proof Binance was hacked.  There were discrpencies the hacker provided, that made the pull less valid


[20-Jan-19 11:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Phaelon> My guess is, the hacker just mnade up a bunch from already available data

[20-Jan-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'm ready for round 2!


[20-Jan-19 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @miketout  @Godballz  Of course you're right, I just think they (CPU Miners Club) would like to have someone present over in their Discord to answer questions. That's why they put that into their rules. 
And in my opinion, "Purgatory" is not better than "unloved", in contrary it is probably worse, and Verus might be kicked out of their discord if we can't at least partially fill their "application" form and publish it. That's why I posted it above, so the empty parts could be filled in by people who know. And about their desired mods or devs, I think we could give a hint to come to Verus discord for answers,  if noone else is present there. Guess this could also work.


[20-Jan-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Thoskk on the other hand, let em do what they want. I don't see jumping through hoops while work can be done being a priority for the really dedicated projects that are focused on accomplishing goals. We didn't even know about them a few days ago and our activity there I'm sure is welcome too


[20-Jan-19 01:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @Godballz  I just think this would be good publicity, because it's exactly where a lot of CPU miners meet. Wouldn't take much, if somebody could give me the information missing above, I could post that and see what happens. I just can't be here 24/7, cuz I'm a little busy with live outside discord, too. Else I would do the mod job with pleasure.


[20-Jan-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> oh, gets deleted... great


[20-Jan-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> how can I post this again without it beeing deleted?


[20-Jan-19 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Its just a lot of hoops to jump through when us going there is good for their discord too so I think it's sort of a mutual thing and itd be nice a little leniency on all the rules. It should still be fun


[20-Jan-19 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yeah I found that out the other day as well. Discord links automatically delete your post


[20-Jan-19 01:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I don't really know a way around it but I'm sure they're probably is a simple one that I just don't know


[20-Jan-19 01:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> I already filled it as to my knowledge, I just want it to be completed and checked by people who know better ... I'll try again


[20-Jan-19 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> kept in now?


[20-Jan-19 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @Godballz  do you see it, too, or is it just me?


[20-Jan-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I am actually not sure if we need more profiteering farms on the network. What we need is people who are interested in the project and want to see it thrive.

[20-Jan-19 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> What about the PoW period?


[20-Jan-19 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @miketout  Yes. A few people were saying that we shouldn't spend the funds to get on an exchange. And sure, it is a lot of money. But there is no way around it. I think what we are doing, is right. 
Sorry for the late response. I am watching my niece and my nephew.


[20-Jan-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Thoskk I dont know what that means- um indefinite maybe? What's that supposed to mean exactly?  Unknown?

[dscrdvrsc] <Ted> i really like portfolio tracking in mobile wallet.


[21-Jan-19 11:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mavenL> why portfolio tracking when we have blockfolio?


[22-Jan-19 12:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ted> so you dont need blockfolio anymore.


[22-Jan-19 12:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the idea is that the wallet knows what you have and can always give you an up to date view of your holdings. it's not tracking portfolios that aren't there or that you enter separately. it's just an automatic function


[22-Jan-19 02:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <basti> Does the Portfolio tracking only supports KMD family Coins?

[23-Jan-19 05:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> this one works definitely, i've asked somebody who's mining verushash2 using that cpu


[23-Jan-19 05:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> with the released binaries you can get from the veruscoin website, maybe it was that url that made a bot go *boom*


[23-Jan-19 06:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> ...but let me guess i misunderstood it and the original question was about GPUs


[23-Jan-19 07:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @–í–∏—Ç–∞–ª–∏–π If your AMD rig has a decent CPU you may get a better hash


[23-Jan-19 11:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ABK> Noticed KMD is on the Ledger hardware wallets, is there any chance VRSC will be too at some future point?


[23-Jan-19 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @ABK We definitely expect hardware wallet support at some point. Our primary focus right now is PBaaS, which is a broad effort across a number of areas of dev and has started to include business development as well. While we don't want to talk about potential opportunities prematurely, so as to respect confidentiality and also avoid anything resembling hype, we believe there is no single thing we could be focused on that has more potential for value and use of Verus at this time.


[24-Jan-19 12:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ABK> Thanks for the reply Mike, makes perfect sense.


[25-Jan-19 06:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <MMMCCCXXXIII> I have this weird feeling, that CB listing will do bad for VRSC üôÑ


[25-Jan-19 06:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> listing is always bad for the coin being listed


[25-Jan-19 06:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> unless it's a DEX


[25-Jan-19 07:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @MMMCCCXXXIII why? @Emmanuel why?


[25-Jan-19 07:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> people like to dump


[25-Jan-19 07:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> but it will also encourage investment.


[25-Jan-19 07:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> on a bear market...


[25-Jan-19 07:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> yeah


[25-Jan-19 07:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <basti> I'm sure that verus survives the bear market. I think verus is like a lambo in a Beetle chassis. The beauty is still visible.


[25-Jan-19 10:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ABK> Verus seems to have a very different community to the usual ICO & Dump crowd, so not sure the DEX listing will be too detrimental


[25-Jan-19 10:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I really think this and many listings for the right reasons are only positive, not detrimental. If people wanted to dump Verus, they already have the ability to do so. People sell and there is some volume, but many just don't want to sell at these prices. The closest thing I saw to dumping was when secret mining gave a very small number of people the ability to mine coins much less expensively than everyone else, and we had some people with many coins who had no idea why they should care about the project besides they could snipe it. Right now, a new exchange, especially a DEX with a lot of customers who don't yet know about Verus, will only spread awareness and provide some additional liquidity, that will be more important when PBaaS is released to prevent giant pumps, which are also not healthy, IMO. It should also secure CMC listing, which is another way to spread awareness. In the case of Verus, I see a risk in many small listings, which isn't as much about more selling as it is a distraction from what's important. I think Crypto Bridge listing is only positive, and I'm grateful that we have a community that could pull together as we did to make it happen.


[25-Jan-19 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @miketout I agree. I have been trading Verus more now recently. There are some big sales of the coin going on but in never pushes the price much below 2900. There is also a lot of big purchasing going on. I for one want to accumulate coins. Hey @miketout , when you develop the PBaas how will you demonstrate it? I'm really curious.


[25-Jan-19 10:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> btw, with all that said, I hope that people both buying and selling Verus could spread the volume around on the exchanges that do support us. show them all a little love üòâ 
@Gloryman the vision paper describes that. there are companies talking about leveraging PBaaS beyond the foundational applications described in the vision paper, which are polls, elections, identity, but nothing I could disclose at this time, since those are companies, not our community project itself. Have you read the vision paper? You might want to take a look, if not: https://veruscoin.io/downloads/papers/VerusVision.pdf


[25-Jan-19 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @miketout I will spread the volume. I have read the white paper but it can be difficult for a pleb like me to understand. I get the points about polls and creating multiple block chains that can be scaled and rolled into one.  But I thought you might want to test and demonstrate the technology before it gets to being on a business.


[25-Jan-19 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Like fun polls


[25-Jan-19 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> or polls on games


[25-Jan-19 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> or like mock identity


[25-Jan-19 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the fun polls and polls on games will definitely be part of the follow on work


[25-Jan-19 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> some were hinted at in the Vision Paper designs


[25-Jan-19 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> So people can really understand the tech and community members can easily describe it to other interested people.


[25-Jan-19 11:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> We could use it to create fantasy soccer game where wallet holders vote for the best players and buy them using assets or something


[25-Jan-19 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> identity is after that. i am extremely confident that once released, it will not be hard to understand. it is all i can do to keep up with both building it and spending time, which I enjoy, with people who would like to discuss using it for some very exciting use cases.


[25-Jan-19 11:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> @miketout Do you mine if I try to create a game that the Verus community could play using the voting polls. I take it we can just create a PBaaS in the wallet and then other wallet users can vote and stuff.


[25-Jan-19 11:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> there isn't really a way to do that until PBaaS, but I'd be happy to help then. right now, my focus is on building it. also, when I say talking to people, I mean big, corporate use cases that will build revenue generating businesses. I believe that I should at least use a little of my time to encourage those kinds of efforts as I build PBaaS, for the benefit of the project and community. I will not be able to generally help people know how to build on PBaaS until it is working. after that, I'd love to see you and others use it for many things.

[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Hey guys, please welcome @vcoosc  to the community. We are both community leaders on RITOCOIN and I have been telling him about the virtues of verus coin. He has a really good cpu and can help add hash and coin holding. 'CPU mining is the future!' , and dont worry, I told him the official slogan line too. üòÇ  Also, he is very active and helpful to have in the discord channel. We are growing with high quality membership and good people.


[26-Jan-19 07:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Welcome @vcoosc 
Always nice to see new members üòé, nice work G man


[26-Jan-19 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> Would a few of you maybe join the CPU Miners Club's discord and vote for VERUS (it's in #coin-purgatory). We only need 2 or 3 Votes to keep it in there.


[26-Jan-19 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> Hey guys just my opinion. I think that cpu farms are not good for verus. I think the best thing is to convince people to be interested in the project and then mine if they have a decent cpu.


[26-Jan-19 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> And if someone wants to freelance as a moderator in their VERUS channel, it would be a good idea. I would do it myself, but I may not be online each day, and surely not 24/7.


[26-Jan-19 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @Gloryman  Guess we can't choose who will mine Verus, though we might need more miners for distribution and acceptance. The one goes with the other.


[26-Jan-19 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gloryman> I think that the miner farms just mine and dump in my opinion. Not that there is anything wrong with that. I don't think they care or are interested in the project I think they just want to make quick profit and I don't think it adds to distribution or acceptance. But do what you thin is best buddy.


[26-Jan-19 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Thoskk wait, how do you vote? I don't think I have yet


[26-Jan-19 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Chazmainian Devil your comments are baseless, as is your false pretense of knowing anything about me or my motivation around work, and FUD around PBaaS. there is no burnout happening, and PBaaS is looking more like the next generation of Teslas than your description

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> OK, I reread your posts, @Chazmainian Devil. maybe, as I thought at first, you are well meaning. i am ok, and thank you for your concern, if that's what it is. i will interpret your comparison to the truck frame as hard work and taking breaks, not saying PBaaS could really be compared to something in bad shape. it's in good shape and coming along nicely.

[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> Just a thought lately:
I have been seeing LOTS of Fake Stake Articles coming out. 
Any resources I can point people to for verus solution and an introduction to these people?


[30-Jan-19 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> Also, this morning DigitalPrice announced they had wallet display issues.  
"Should be fixed" but ask them in their discord if you still can't get anywhere.


[30-Jan-19 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jbates58> @miketout mike, so for the uninitiated (like myself)

What's the difference between transparent and sapling? Other than privacy (I think) why would it matter if you use either on an exchange?


[30-Jan-19 06:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @FishyGuts I haven't heard from DP about a display issue. Was it with Verus? Also, there is not a known fake stake attack on Verus. We check all parts of the stake transaction before storing a block, which prevents propagation, and any header only attack on individual nodes also requires PoW, which is a benefit of the hybrid approach. I also plan to put a better-than-pow solution to even a targeted header attack in the PBaaS upgrade.
@jbates58 I have asked if CryptoBridge will support both transparent and Sapling out, which they should be able to do. If so, mobile wallets will be supported for withdrawal before they also support z-transactions. z-transactions on input would mean that to send Verus to the exchange, you would need a native wallet until we or someone adds z-transaction support to a mobile wallet that supports Verus. That is planned, but we will likely focus on PBaaS over mobile z-transactions until the Zcash z-transaction wallet is finished as well. They are taking the same approach we would take anyhow.
The arguments for would be privacy for all exchange users in and out. The argument against would be privacy for all exchange users in and out as well as needing a native wallet to send coins to the exchange. For example,

[dscrdvrsc] <Ted> great


[30-Jan-19 08:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> since z-tx mostly make sense having big pool of shielded tx, I watch Verus as a coin where z-tx are just a bonus not so much in use in reality


[30-Jan-19 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> while there is a difference between t-tx and z-tx maintanance  t-tx are more important it seems in this context ?

[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> Hey @FishyGuts, nice to see u in our discord. I hope u hang out more here. Also, I'm looking forward to u interviewing mike about PBaas.


[31-Jan-19 12:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <basti> I voted thump Up. I like the function to use z adress for Exchange. But the native mode is not for mass adoption. This could scare off some investors who are unfamiliar with it. Still support from me. You have  to go new ways.


[31-Jan-19 01:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> I would wait until the zdeposit/zwithdraw is stable before enabling it.

[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i'm waiting on linux to sync up üòÑ


[31-Jan-19 03:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but it's looking fine.


[31-Jan-19 03:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> linux 0.5.5 agama works for me as well, staking and mining.


[31-Jan-19 03:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> debug.log and `getmininginfo` and GUI output match


[31-Jan-19 03:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> which... is a good sign


[31-Jan-19 03:48 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <AlexLibertas> Who's the head chief in here - is it @miketout ?


[31-Jan-19 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> That'd be him with the üëë


[31-Jan-19 04:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> he's asleep now i think, just fyi


[31-Jan-19 04:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AlexLibertas> Cool cheers guys


[31-Jan-19 04:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AlexLibertas> How's the community in here? It look's pretty active from what I've seen, i'll drop in and out over the next week


[31-Jan-19 04:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> excuse my french but it's fucking awesome


[31-Jan-19 04:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> nothing short of that


[31-Jan-19 04:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AlexLibertas> Awesome


[31-Jan-19 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ted> @AlexLibertas welcome


[31-Jan-19 07:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @AlexLibertas welcome ‚úå


[31-Jan-19 08:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @GlorymanRTS over here


[31-Jan-19 08:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> ok so with your first analogy. What was unique about it compared to leaving the room and catching up later?


[31-Jan-19 08:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> so like I was saying, 1 of the 3 guys leaves the room while the other 2 keep making transactions in their ledgers, the 3rd guy let's say doesn't add anything to his ledger, when he returns he just updates with the entries the other 2 made and is caught up


[31-Jan-19 08:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> yeah i understand that. So that is when you turn off you wallet and not change it


[31-Jan-19 08:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> What's unique about the other analogy, wherein the 3rd guy "forks" away, that's equivelent to him leaving the room and while he's alone entering transaction entries that the 2 don't know about


[31-Jan-19 08:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> So, how does being on a different wallet mean that you are making transactions that the other two dont know about?


[31-Jan-19 08:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> then he comes back and wants them to be valid, but in those lines where he entered his own, unbeknownst to the other 2, they have agreed upon transactions already filling it out.


[31-Jan-19 08:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> So they aren't going to delete theirs in favor of his


[31-Jan-19 08:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> if he wants to keep entering valid data with them, he has to delete all the entries he made alone and replace them with thiers


[31-Jan-19 08:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> why do old wallets make up their own transactions?


[31-Jan-19 08:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> i get that more ledgers wins. I don;t get that an old wallet tries to make transactions that other ledgers don't know about


[31-Jan-19 08:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> So that's a really simplified, to make the "fork" part more understandable let's say there are 10 people and 3 leave


[31-Jan-19 08:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> the 3 sit in another room making entries in their ledgers


[31-Jan-19 08:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> go on


[31-Jan-19 08:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <papacheal> @John Westbrook Has anyone else mentioned the UI "bug" that seems to have appeared in 5.5 wallet release regarding staking/mining? When I click "Start Staking", the  UI appears to enable both Staking and Mining as "true", as if they are linked. If I "Stop Mining" nothing happens; I have to "Stop Staking" to stop them both.


[31-Jan-19 08:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> then 1 of those 3 tries to go back to the other 7 and have his new entries validated and the 7 to replace their entires with his new ones from the group of 3


[31-Jan-19 08:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> not going to happen because the 7 already had consensus on their entries made while he was away


[31-Jan-19 08:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @papacheal check out gui channel buddy


[31-Jan-19 08:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> so if he wants to keep a valid book within that group of 7, he would need to remove the entries the 3 made and update that section of where he was away with entries from the 7


[31-Jan-19 08:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <papacheal> @GlorymanRTS My bad...didn't scroll back far enough past your accounting discussion. üòÉ


[31-Jan-19 08:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Now, add one more layer


[31-Jan-19 08:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @John Westbrook yeah bro I understand more ledgers with the same entries is a different fork from other ledgers with a different entries.


[31-Jan-19 08:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> they aren't just entering data


[31-Jan-19 08:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @papacheal np buddy. I hope it solved your problem


[31-Jan-19 08:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> back to the 10, they are exchanging money and keeping record


[31-Jan-19 08:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> ok i get that


[31-Jan-19 08:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> everyone agrees to keep a duplicate ledger of all transactions that occur in the group in order


[31-Jan-19 08:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> listening to the extra layer part now


[31-Jan-19 08:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> yeah i get that


[31-Jan-19 08:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> person 1 gives 5 tokens to person 2 and everyone updates their copy of the ledger with that transaction


[31-Jan-19 08:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> this goes on for a while


[31-Jan-19 08:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> now the 3 leave the room


[31-Jan-19 08:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> 5 plus 5 plus 5 right


[31-Jan-19 08:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> in a different room they exchange tokens


[31-Jan-19 08:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> who exchanges the tokens?


[31-Jan-19 08:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> the 3


[31-Jan-19 08:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> the 3


[31-Jan-19 08:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> üòÉ


[31-Jan-19 08:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> lol, ok


[31-Jan-19 08:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> they make record of it in the same ledgers they took with them from the first room


[31-Jan-19 08:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> 3 and the 7?


[31-Jan-19 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> 10


[31-Jan-19 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> üòÇ


[31-Jan-19 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> yeah i follow


[31-Jan-19 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> the 7 guys in the first room know nothing of these transactions and in the mean time are also making exchanges and recording them


[31-Jan-19 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @stretcher83 RIDDLE SOLVED


[31-Jan-19 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> üëçüèºüòé


[31-Jan-19 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> üòÅ


[31-Jan-19 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Sorry


[31-Jan-19 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> let's say, for simplification, while the 3 are away 3 thransactions are made by them in their little room.  and by luck 3 transactions are made in the group of 7.


[31-Jan-19 08:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <stretcher83> Just following along , nice explanation john üëçüèº


[31-Jan-19 08:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> so they get an eraser and say dont worry you can be on the same group of leaders (JK) üòÇ


[31-Jan-19 08:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> if any one or all of the 3 return to the first room, their copies of ledgers will only match each other (the 3), but not the 7


[31-Jan-19 08:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> the 7 say, if you want to stay and enter in your book the rule is that everyone's ledger must match before we move on to the next entry


[31-Jan-19 08:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> So they either need stay out of the room or erase the 3 transaction entries they made while away and replace them with the 3 made by the 7 during that time, then they can join the group again and keep going


[31-Jan-19 08:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> That's why we have words like consensus or rules etc


[31-Jan-19 08:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> or even algorithm


[31-Jan-19 08:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> So person A 5 to person B, Person B 5 to Person C, in the group of 3. if the 7 show Person B 5 to Person C. It wont count because they didn't have the first transaction person A5 to person B, right?


[31-Jan-19 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> but they could delete the A5 to person B and they will be let back in


[31-Jan-19 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> So it all matches?


[31-Jan-19 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> except that in the room of 7 they won't know about the transaction of Person B to Person C, because it occurred in the other room.


[31-Jan-19 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> So they'd have to delete any and all entries made while away from the room of 7


[31-Jan-19 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> if no entries were made, (they were offline), then it's a moot point


[31-Jan-19 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> they just have to add the entries they missed while away


[31-Jan-19 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> maybe they had to use the restroom


[31-Jan-19 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> no harm done


[31-Jan-19 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> hopefully


[31-Jan-19 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> lol


[31-Jan-19 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> So let's add yet anohter layer


[31-Jan-19 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Coinbase


[31-Jan-19 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> lol, So, using the old wallet is like using a different room


[31-Jan-19 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> No


[31-Jan-19 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> wait


[31-Jan-19 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> if you mean:


[31-Jan-19 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> using a wallet on a forked chain, then that is like using a different room


[31-Jan-19 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> and if you then take that wallet back online to the main chain, any entries made to it from the other forked chain, will just not exist and be removed/replaced with the main chain consensus entries that occurred during that time


[31-Jan-19 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> What I mean is how can using the old wallet cause a fork or (leaving to another room as you were saying)?


[31-Jan-19 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> using an old wallet doesn't cause a fork


[31-Jan-19 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> I thought you said we need to update our wallets so we are not on a forked chain

[31-Jan-19 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> No I said it could result in you forking away


[31-Jan-19 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> why you would fork away is not just because you're on an old wallet


[31-Jan-19 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> what's the difference in 'forking away and 'causing a fork'?


[31-Jan-19 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> it would occur for other reasons like an attacker taking advantage of the security issue that was fixed


[31-Jan-19 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> Oh, you mean older versions with security issues


[31-Jan-19 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Yes


[31-Jan-19 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> but all the older versions have security issues right?


[31-Jan-19 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> That's why this is a critical update, it addresses an issue


[31-Jan-19 08:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Right, v0.5.5 fixes the issue from prior versions (5.0 - 5.4)


[31-Jan-19 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> Ah, thanks for explaining , you have been very helpful.


[31-Jan-19 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> üòÉ glad to help!


[31-Jan-19 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> what do you do for verus? do you code for them?


[31-Jan-19 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> So much of the tech of blockchain is really simple, but the "tech" layer makes it hard to understand a lot of time


[31-Jan-19 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> how does staking fit into your room full of people analogy ?


[31-Jan-19 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Right now I'm contribute by helping with communications and am doing some coding on a couple cool things which I'll share soon


[31-Jan-19 08:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> oh, that's cool what kind of resources do you use for the communications?


[31-Jan-19 08:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> So that's another layer, coinbases, in the simple example everyone is just exchanging tokens...the coinbase is where the supply of coins originates, so people have tokens/coins to exchange with each other


[31-Jan-19 08:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> staking and mining are like "jobs" that let you get paid from the coinbase


[31-Jan-19 08:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> What is the metaphor for layer? floor room?


[31-Jan-19 08:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> but the coinbase isn't a person, it's another algorithm driven function, and spits out coins if you solve a puzzle


[31-Jan-19 08:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> it's sort of like a game really


[31-Jan-19 08:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> üòÉ


[31-Jan-19 08:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Idk


[31-Jan-19 08:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> So everyone comes into the room and there's this shiny cool, maybe ancient-looking, box, we'll call it a "box of truth"


[31-Jan-19 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> maybe staking means that the people in the original room are forced to stay in the room and piss their pants!


[31-Jan-19 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> the 10 sit around the box like a seance


[31-Jan-19 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> ok, I want to hear what happens to the box of truth!


[31-Jan-19 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> and for mining, it's a really hard problem to solve and each works super hard to figure it out before someone else.


[31-Jan-19 08:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> if it's getting too difficult for anyone in the room, difficulty can drop so it takes only a minute to solve

[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> like sudoku


[31-Jan-19 08:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> sure!


[31-Jan-19 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> solve it first, the box of truth spits out beautiful shiny coins


[31-Jan-19 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> 24 of them


[31-Jan-19 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> üòÉ


[31-Jan-19 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> but how is that different from mining?


[31-Jan-19 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> that was mining


[31-Jan-19 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> you use the same metaphor for mining and staking!


[31-Jan-19 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> üòú


[31-Jan-19 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> basically


[31-Jan-19 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> i'm tired honestly lol


[31-Jan-19 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> but staking is showing you value the coins, because you hold onto them


[31-Jan-19 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> ok, how are you means of communication going? what do you use?


[31-Jan-19 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> the more you hold, the more "stake" you have in the entire thing, the room, the group, the box of truth


[31-Jan-19 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> etc etc


[31-Jan-19 08:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> okay going to stop cos I actually am tired and need to do some work

[31-Jan-19 08:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> have a good weekend


[31-Jan-19 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @hellcatz So, what is the spoon a metaphor for in crypto?


[31-Jan-19 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hellcatz> They made a spork üòÑ


[31-Jan-19 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> hahaha


[31-Jan-19 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> did you make that?


[31-Jan-19 08:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hellcatz> Google is amazing


[31-Jan-19 08:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> hahaha love it


[31-Jan-19 08:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @hellcatz is it you who does the fpga coing?


[31-Jan-19 08:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> later @GlorymanRTS


[31-Jan-19 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hellcatz> No not me,   I was working on OpenCL stuff, but I got to a road block and havent found a big enough ladder yet...


[31-Jan-19 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @John Westbrook I hope we chat about this stuff later, its fun


[31-Jan-19 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> sorry not avoiding your question on communication, but we can talk more about it, I do have some tasks that are pressing at the moment. In short I'm not sure what you mean by tools, I use the tool of words I guess


[31-Jan-19 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @hellcatz I would love to get the AMD's working. Do you think the radeon 7 might do well. I was thinking about getting them?


[31-Jan-19 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @John Westbrook I mean median and means


[31-Jan-19 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> twitter, blogs, youtube, twitch, radio, ect


[31-Jan-19 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> links


[31-Jan-19 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> mags


[31-Jan-19 08:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Just try to help as much as possible getting word out, writing stuff, helping drive marketing stuff, help where I can with branding/rebranding efforts, pr, really anything I can help with in all that.  And then working on the website and some cool and exciting upcoming projects I'm working on now


[31-Jan-19 08:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> ah, yeah, not youtube or twitch...would love it if someone was good at those things to pitch in


[31-Jan-19 08:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hellcatz> I picked up some AMD cards back in early equihash days.  Had a few 390X and 480's.  I haven't used any AMD cards in a few years now...


[31-Jan-19 08:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @John Westbrook So you are like  website designer mainly?


[31-Jan-19 08:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @hellcatz so you don't know much about the radeon 7


[31-Jan-19 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hellcatz> No, it would be nice to get OpenCL working though...hehe    
I think Chris mentioned he would jump on it as soon as they figure out how to get as much as possible out of cuda...


[31-Jan-19 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @John Westbrook I'm trying to grow my twtich and youtube, but not much luck so far. Keep at it I gues.


[31-Jan-19 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> my history is very diverse lol


[31-Jan-19 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @hellcatz yeah, but I mean the features of the 7nm and the 16GB HMB2 memory. I wondered how much difference it would make


[31-Jan-19 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> been an entrepreneur my whole life...literally like when I was 11 I was calling biz op adds in the back of Popular Science


[31-Jan-19 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> DM me the link?


[31-Jan-19 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> lol, I don't even know what that is


[31-Jan-19 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @John Westbrook youtube and twitch? sure


[31-Jan-19 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> it's a magazine...I had like years of old copies.


[31-Jan-19 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> its only poker and RTS games I like playing and commentating


[31-Jan-19 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> I mean I was subscribed as a youngster.


[31-Jan-19 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> I only properly started last weekend


[31-Jan-19 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hellcatz> I havent seen Popular Science in a long time @John Westbrook üëç


[31-Jan-19 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> right?


[31-Jan-19 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> I was thinking about crypto


[31-Jan-19 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> but its hard as i dont know much


[31-Jan-19 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> man my fav was the one where they talked about flying cars


[31-Jan-19 09:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> that can be a really good place to be @GlorymanRTS in regards to helping others who don't know much


[31-Jan-19 09:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> if you can learn enough to accurately help people and simplify it for them


[31-Jan-19 09:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @John Westbrook sure I don't mind helping and trying


[31-Jan-19 09:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> part of the challenge for people who get more and more entrenched in complex technology is sort of the disconnect in how to explain it in simple terms


[31-Jan-19 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> cos the questions don't happen for them anymore


[31-Jan-19 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> I'm on track to getting around 2000 hours of watchable stream


[31-Jan-19 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> they are creating stuff and don't need to see it from the angle of a noob


[31-Jan-19 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> nice

[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> actually the guys I usually stream to don't need simplification. They are some of the best coders in the world


[31-Jan-19 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> I'm happy to help you if you have certain topic etc, you could pick my brain


[31-Jan-19 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> oh, cool!


[31-Jan-19 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> is it relevant tho?


[31-Jan-19 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> you stream poker games?


[31-Jan-19 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> The guys that watch my RTS games are like top level academics and computer scientists, lol


[31-Jan-19 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> oh awesome


[31-Jan-19 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @John Westbrook yeah, poker stream is not too popular at the moment


[31-Jan-19 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> so the real challenge is to explain things in a way that they don't discredit you?


[31-Jan-19 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> oh rts games I missed that in my tired fog


[31-Jan-19 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> I will ask them to pop by sometime. One of them said he wasn't interested because he's doing too much academic work and doesnt want to do much elese


[31-Jan-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> Another said he prefers to code computer games


[31-Jan-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> Another said he wants to design games instead


[31-Jan-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> well, gotta do what you love


[31-Jan-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> Oh there is one guy who said he would pop by


[31-Jan-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> let me find his youtube. really nice guy


[31-Jan-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> cool


[31-Jan-19 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> his name is warren


[31-Jan-19 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> he played that RTS final 2v2 on my stream


[31-Jan-19 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> He mainly codes websites


[31-Jan-19 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> I think he went to harvard


[31-Jan-19 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> I'd imagine if the acedemians understood what Verus is about and is so far, they may find it quite fascinating


[31-Jan-19 09:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> as you can see by my spelling, I'm not one


[31-Jan-19 09:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> cool


[31-Jan-19 09:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> as for coding, I mainly do websites as well


[31-Jan-19 09:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> they do. but they often are busy doing really importants stuff or just stuff they find more amusing.


[31-Jan-19 09:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> i prefer building things from scratch, regionally where I am in the usa there's not much business for that


[31-Jan-19 09:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> I can also feel a bit guilty about asking them because they usually play RTS to relax


[31-Jan-19 09:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> Not to be asked to work! lol


[31-Jan-19 09:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> people are cheap and have the owner's son or whoevever do the wordpress stuff lol


[31-Jan-19 09:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> ah yeah


[31-Jan-19 09:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> speaking of work, I'll chat later üòÉ


[31-Jan-19 09:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> good questions and hopefully my explanations were helpful!

[31-Jan-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mountaindrifter> Is there information somewhere about the security issue that was resolved with the recent update, however vague it may be


[31-Jan-19 12:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @mountaindrifter I would imagine if we hear anything it would be well after most have upgraded to the new version. I'm sure many users haven't had the chance and it wouldn't be good to reveal a potential exploit so soon


[31-Jan-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Thinking about the z-transaction/t-transaction thing, one good thing about z-transactions is that it would ease the suspicions of a few that some exchanges could be staking. So that's a plus, along with being untraceable.

[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> you think that's safe?


[31-Jan-19 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hellcatz> Interesting, it should be fine.  If you start getting connection issues let me know.  We may hit some unknown limit.


[31-Jan-19 01:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> good deal. Will test it out first to make sure it's actually faster


[31-Jan-19 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hellcatz> If you do run into connection problem, you can always send some workers to the alternate stratums around world.
Thanks for playing, happy to help!


[31-Jan-19 11:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Question: Is Verus' explorer as comprehensive/functional as other explorers in the crypto space? i.e: can one view what amounts individual addresses/wallets hold on the blockchain? And also, is it possible to determine that a group of addresses belong to the same wallet? e.g: can it be determined, without having access to one's Agama wallet, that all 100 addresses that come with that wallet belong to one wallet/account, simply by viewing the explorer?


[01-Feb-19 12:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @jintaa yes and no. it is possible to track connections between transparent addresses, but when they go into the private pool of funds, any direct connection to their source or destination is broken. Still, with deeper analysis, it is also possible to track some funds into the pool and assign probability of those transfers being related to others of similar amounts out shortly after being somehow related. Having both transparent and private addresses makes privacy possible, but unless you have a forced, fully private chain, like Pirate, which then has some challenges with programmability, you may be able to analyze to some degree, unless people are trying to preserve privacy intentionally.


[01-Feb-19 12:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Ok, @miketout , how about being able to determine if the 100 addresses assigned to an agama wallet all belong to the same wallet, just by looking at the explorer? Are the addresses randomly assigned to each wallet, or are they somehow linked, even on the blockchain/explorer?


[01-Feb-19 02:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> wallets generate addresses that cant be linked


[01-Feb-19 02:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> however usage can end up linking them, especially via change


[01-Feb-19 02:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> or using multiple addresses as vin inputs


[01-Feb-19 02:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> what I see on BTC is that some entity is sending small tainted dust amounts 0,000005 to the largest BTC addresses. then when these wallets do a spend, the tainted dust is spent and creates a linkage to the other input addresses and output addresses


[01-Feb-19 02:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> this allows construction (over time) a pretty accurate statistical mapping of email address to BTC address


[01-Feb-19 02:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> and ip address


[01-Feb-19 02:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @jl777c buddy can i ask your opinion on something.


[01-Feb-19 02:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> combine this with the KYC info that exchanges (and hackers) have and transparent addresses, lives up to its name


[01-Feb-19 02:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> of course, not everyone and certainly not the explorers will have access to the ip router level correlations or exchange KYC info


[01-Feb-19 02:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @jl777c If I put most of my verus on a sale order on verus at 3100 hoping it will sell and then the price will go lower in future, so I can buy. Do you think  that is a good trading strategy?


[01-Feb-19 02:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> can you predict when the bear market ends?


[01-Feb-19 02:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> if you can, just sell all crypto and buy back the moment the bear market ends


[01-Feb-19 02:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @jl777c not using technical analysis or fundemental analysis.


[01-Feb-19 02:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> you need to use psychic powers to determine the exact end of bear market


[01-Feb-19 02:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> if you dont have such powers, then best to cost average while the price is low


[01-Feb-19 02:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> thanks buddy


[01-Feb-19 02:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> @GlorymanRTS What you proposed is gambling, unless you have enough to control the market, thus minimizing the risk.


[01-Feb-19 02:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> So, it's gambling but it could pay off?


[01-Feb-19 02:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> With my luck whenever I'd sell it would be right before a bull run.


[01-Feb-19 02:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> But if there is a bull run, the price will come back down in future and u can just buy again when the price is low right?


[01-Feb-19 02:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> If it were that simple. It's a gamble either way.


[01-Feb-19 02:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Someone has to be willing to buy at the price you're selling, and someone has to be willing to sell at the price you're buying. Pure and simple.


[01-Feb-19 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @zpajk thanks for it advice buddy, it's appreciated.


[01-Feb-19 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> ``1000 VRSC sell at 0,00003100 BTC = 0,031 BTC
0,031 BTC buy back at 0,00002500 BTC = 1240 VRSC``
240 VRSC gain, if it goes through. Only you can determine if it's worth the risk. Multiply that with whatever the amount you were thinking. But greater amount would equal less chance of hitting full bids/asks because of the low volume on the exchanges.


[01-Feb-19 08:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> This is called market making. You can do it with any commodity. Most commodities are more heavily traded than Verus so the spread is not so wide and they are less profitable


[01-Feb-19 08:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> But there are companies which exist to do exactly what is described here and they certainly are profitable


[01-Feb-19 08:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> The wrinkle is that you need to consistently be the top of book at the bid and the ask, which means you need to fight with others (read: bots) trying to do the exact same thing


[01-Feb-19 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> The other risk is that the underlying commodity moves out of the channel you have identified. It's hard to estimate the size of that risk for Verus


[01-Feb-19 10:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <runningwithbeer> I notice that the new wallet seems to connect to 5 peers by default. Is there a list of additional reliable peers?


[01-Feb-19 10:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> I'm the most reliable peer i guess. üòÇ üòá


[01-Feb-19 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gamer278> What is the difference in connections? since the start of mining verus back over the summer I always had 4 connections. After upgrading to 0.5.5 i know have 5 connections. Any benefit to more connections?


[01-Feb-19 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> yes, more connections means that new blocks will propagate to you faster


[01-Feb-19 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> reduces the time you spend mining stale blocks


[02-Feb-19 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> it's a great benefit to all 'full node' operators like pool operators, explorers and such (also for the electrum servers respectively the vrsc nodes behind). before it was rather hard to build up a number of connections. now, it's much easier


[02-Feb-19 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and while the increase by 1 on your local end won't do much difference for you guys but in some edge cases where 4 of the 5 are not responding (), my pool went from cancering around 4-8 connections to >15 right after relaunch with the new release


[02-Feb-19 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> this is a slight change that makes me very happy üòÉ

[dscrdvrsc] <gamer278> I just upgraded to new wallet b and it says unknown error rescanning blocks. Should i just wait?


[04-Feb-19 07:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> as long as it's only complaining about the blockchain data and it's not complaining about any wallet related stuff it's ok to wait or brute-force this "problem" away by using the bootstrap or something. differently put; rescans happen, sadly


[04-Feb-19 07:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ok88> looking for a smart way to extract keys out of 100+ wallet.dat files so that I can easily import the keys to a single wallet. Any ideas?


[04-Feb-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hellcatz> @ok88 That will need to be scripted, there isn't a dump all wallet keys RPC call (I do not think..)
There is a dump single address key   RPC call though...

Look up your addresses,  then script a loop to dump all the keys for them one by one...sorry, i don't have examples...just the concept...hehe


[04-Feb-19 09:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hellcatz> List your t-addr: `getaddressesbyaccount ""`
List your z-addr: `z_listaddresses`
Dump t-addr key: `dumpprivkey addr`
Dumpy z-addr key:  `z_exportkey addr`


[04-Feb-19 09:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hellcatz> Looks like there is a `dumpwallet` for t-addr and a `z_exportwallet` for z-addr  command to dump then all into a single file...


[04-Feb-19 09:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> You can dump all wallet keys with z_exportwallet, but for 100 wallets, you may do better to run a recoverwallet Python script that I have as a gist, as long as there aren‚Äôt many z-addresses in the wallets, as the script pulls out t-addresses only. I can post a link when I‚Äôm back to the PC.


[05-Feb-19 04:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <LocoMB> I was just about to install latest VERUS wallet, but realized that it is _STILL_ called Agama, and Agama0.5.5.b at that- 
I really do not appreciate that, am I the only one who does not like that?
What is this about?
Is this going to fuck up my Agama0.3.3 installation?


[05-Feb-19 04:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <LocoMB> Are the other coins still accessible in Agama0.5.5.b?
I do have separate users for each wallet I use, but I still dont like the idea of mucking about with _TWO_ different versions of an app that run under the same name


[05-Feb-19 04:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <LocoMB> So why does Komodo main not adopt Agama0.5.5b? 
Something in there that does not go with Komodo, ARRR and all the other chains?


[05-Feb-19 04:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Hi @LocoMB !
Have you read the post from february 4th in  #announcements? It can't tell you what to do, but it explains the options. Don't know if the non verus enhanced agama has gotten around to support verus fully yet.


[05-Feb-19 05:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <LocoMB> no, will do, Thanks!


[05-Feb-19 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @ok88 this script, which does require the prerequisites and Python 3.5+, can create a bash script to import all the transparent keys in a wallet: https://gist.github.com/miketout/ce869cbbedf48d55a813ff6c026e2166
after you run the bash script that is its output, you would want to do a rescan of the wallet. If you were doing 100 wallets, you would want to do the rescan after all the other imports to make it faster.
It's nothing official or that I can even say anyone besides you should use, but I have used it to recover a few wallets that were corrupted.

[08-Feb-19 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> 252MH/s for one ordinary device is too high. Most likely using verushash 1.0 instead of 2.0.

[08-Feb-19 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Yeah, it's probably running the old verushash 1.0. Any pool running the main algorithm, 2.0, won't accept those shares.


[08-Feb-19 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763

[08-Feb-19 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> I'm guessing you don't actually want to use verushash 1.0?
Use a newer ccminer release for verushash 2.0 instead, if that's the case.

[08-Feb-19 09:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Oh, all of it. ^^
I'm assuming you have Windows and have already gotten a address?
Then head over to: <https://github.com/monkins1010/ccminer/releases/tag/v3.3>
Download all the files, except the two extra compressed files named 'Source code'. Be sure they're all in the same folder after downloading.
Edit 'run.verushash.bat' with a text editor.


[08-Feb-19 09:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> ```ccminer -a verus -o stratum+tcp://na.luckpool.net:3956 -u REoPcdGXthL5yeTCrJtrQv5xhYTknbFbec.1050 -p d=6000 -i 18.5
pause```
If you want to change to another specific pool, change `-o  stratum+tcp://na.luckpool.net:3956`
But most of all, change `-u REoPcdGXthL5yeTCrJtrQv5xhYTknbFbec.1050` to `-u YourOwnTransparentAddress.WorkerName`

[dscrdvrsc] <anrahu akeba> Thanks


[11-Feb-19 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> you're welcome ^^

[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> @anrahu akeba
Is it this one? <https://explorer.vrsc.0x03.services/richlist>


[11-Feb-19 04:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <anrahu akeba> Yes!thank you very much!


[11-Feb-19 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <anrahu akeba> And thank 0*03 too...


[11-Feb-19 08:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TribeOne> Reading about the project.  Looks interesting.


[11-Feb-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GeoAloha> @jimboscott glad it worked! re, your question, I didn't select a parameter; it looks as though @SadykovT also had this issue


[11-Feb-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GeoAloha> and addressed it in the same way


[11-Feb-19 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <its> I've noticed that difficulty jumps a lot from block to block. Is this expected?


[11-Feb-19 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @its I'm citing @miketout  here:
```
the difficulty is going up and down, which is intended to happen quickly as the chain responds to PoS in order to keep a consistent block time
```


[11-Feb-19 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <its> Interesting that this was discussed yesterday. I was just looking at the difficulty chart today and noticed this.

[12-Feb-19 06:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ukminer17> #gpu-hashrate I think it's around 4mh/s?


[12-Feb-19 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> 1080ti is between 9 & 10 MH/s now, i think


[12-Feb-19 10:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> A while ago someone linked me to a list with hashrate of many cpu:s have forgotten the link, anyone who can re post it?


[12-Feb-19 10:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> @miketout Why is it that GPUs: have such a low hashrate? its very unusual that a cpu hashes better than a gpu with all those core and fast memory in em?


[12-Feb-19 10:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> @fng77 Do you mean this one? <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RrSYJDV0Mjj3X-myMC3aQDGkcipivxHsD7ZxJ3r5f_A/>
It's pinned in #cpu-hashrate


[12-Feb-19 10:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Yes! Thanks!


[12-Feb-19 10:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Regarding gpu hashrate vs cpu, I'd recommend you either check out #announcements from 4th december and on, or maybe <https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-community-responds-to-secret-fpga-mining-be5e9ce0eafb>
But in short, it's a result of an algorithm change to equalize hardware, as FPGAs were "too efficient" on verushash 1.0. With the new algorithm GPU miners are still being optimized in aim to gain more hashpower, but as of now CPU is still favored.


[12-Feb-19 10:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> #announcements miketout 2019-01-04
```... Chris has also helped us validate that the new VerusHash 2.0 does a much more complete job of equalizing non-CPU hardware. For now, the best GPUs will be comparable to a low to moderate speed CPU. Knowing Chris, he will improve performance over time, but even with multiples from where we are now, we have some hard evidence that the new algorithm is working exactly as intended. VerusHash 2.0 retakes its position in the crypto-industry as only algorithm we know of that can be mined competitively on CPUs alongside GPUs through equalization. We will find out soon how it stands up to FPGAs, and though I expect them to be able to mine reasonably, I'm confident it will do much better in that respect than the last algorithm. If we are successful in equalizing FPGAs in the final analysis, this will be the first algorithm ever to achieve that. ...

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Got some btc up there this morning just fine. If I have any issues getting the vrsc out later I'll def let ya know


[13-Feb-19 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Veruscoin is fluctuating very much in value like 200% from day to day, which I think is a bit unusual. Anyone that ave a theory about why?


[13-Feb-19 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Thats just low volume


[13-Feb-19 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <kryptoshi> Little trading... everyone staking and keeping the rewards...not a bad thing


[13-Feb-19 09:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Ok, just wondering! it always seem to come back from the drop üòÉ I really don't fully get this with staking. I have like 20 VRSC and been staking for like 2 weeks. What am i really doing? what is the reward and how big is the chance to get reward and does that chance increase wit the amount of coins that you are staking with? Say a worst case senario, i Have 100 VRSC been staking for three months, can it be that you don't get anything, is this just by chance?


[13-Feb-19 10:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> You have a good understanding of how it generally works @fng77, it is based on statistical probability but with luck involved of course and your chances are indeed based on your staking amount except you may want to think bigger amounts at this stage. A community member created this helpful tool, you just need to find the current block height from the explorer and enter it along with your staking amount-
Staking Calculation Spreadsheet- <https://www.dropbox.com/s/yvclqq98j8nxdmg/Verus_POS.xlsx?dl=0>


[13-Feb-19 10:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Sorry and what you are doing when you stake is similar to when you mine with proof of work- it is a consensus mechanism designed to secure the blockchain but one that uses much less energy than PoW. The reward is currently 24 vrsc.


[13-Feb-19 10:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Nice Info! very good, i also want to be a part of protecting blockchain but a reward wouldn't make me cry either.


[13-Feb-19 06:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> 20 your chances are pretty low, but stranger things have happened


[14-Feb-19 12:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Guys have you seen latest VRSC value? $0.111314! Very nice!

[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> üëçüëçüëç


[14-Feb-19 01:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Interesting announcement


[14-Feb-19 01:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> Happy to answer any questions people have. Its been amazing working with the Verus team on this and developing a solution that doesnt nerf the CPU miners (which I am one of too)


[14-Feb-19 01:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'm truly impressed with the price especially for hash per watt. Originally I believed in the fpga endeavor but had no real intention to own one myself but those numbers are impressive while still remaining balanced.


[14-Feb-19 01:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Definitely considering at least checking one of those babies out


[14-Feb-19 01:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> yes, fair price, good results, not killing cpu mining


[14-Feb-19 01:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> This is something very important to us as a team. I do wonder why some teams look for pure profit only. Crypto can be profitable so we believe one can have some ethics at the same time.


[14-Feb-19 01:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> questions about fpga mining should be directed to #mining, just reminder ü§ê


[14-Feb-19 01:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> We will also most likely limit the total sales volume of the units to ensure a decent spread of hashrate between FPGA and CPU


[14-Feb-19 01:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Honestly, I wish the number of channels would be condensed. Especially with the limited activity


[14-Feb-19 01:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> and on top of that we have a max of 6 per customer to help maintain decentralisation


[14-Feb-19 01:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Would you set that fpga up similarly to a gpu rig?


[14-Feb-19 01:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Thank you @CryptoYeti @ukminer17 and @Cuttlebit for your team's work, joining the community, and considering the community's interests along the way. I'm going to sleep, but I guess on your time zone, you may have an eventful day üòÉ


[14-Feb-19 01:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @CryptoYeti i will be pre ordering this one soon, hopefully today, we just plug it into a spare pcie slot on our computer right?


[14-Feb-19 01:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> @miketout Do you want to create a channel for general discussion on this product? So we dont bombard general chat?


[14-Feb-19 01:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> @miketout And thanks to you too for the opportunity. Personally I love the fact that we share similar ethos'


[14-Feb-19 01:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> hmmm... i think @paia  is right that people in mining would want to discuss


[14-Feb-19 01:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @CryptoYeti it works with normal windows pc right, it wont get messed up with amd drivers or something?


[14-Feb-19 01:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> if tomorrow, it seems we need a channel, let's add one, but how about switch to mining for now?


[14-Feb-19 01:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> no problem lets go to mining


[14-Feb-19 01:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> @GlorymanRTS @Patrick ManBearPig Yes this works in PCI-X slot on regular motherboards


[14-Feb-19 02:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> @CryptoYeti  Just a little curios I missed something in the conversation, what is it that works in PCI-X slot? a extension card for cpu:s or something?


[14-Feb-19 02:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Ok, think I saw it in mining forum, verus fpga ukminer?


[14-Feb-19 02:14 AM] Gateway#3763

[14-Feb-19 02:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> @fng77 - This is a PCI-E PCI-X dedicated card with pre loaded VERUS bitstream. Its not an accelerator card


[14-Feb-19 02:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> Basically, plug it into a slot, load up the miner and off it goes.


[14-Feb-19 03:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Lumbi> @Godballz what is the hash per watt on v1 verus with a fpga?


[14-Feb-19 03:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> @CryptoYeti is it available for sale yet? If not what is the planned price?


[14-Feb-19 03:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> ok, found the link. Pre order.


[14-Feb-19 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Very cool.


[14-Feb-19 03:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> How do you get a coupon code üòÖ  a little expensive for me..


[14-Feb-19 05:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> Coupon codes available to the verus community supporters on a one by one basis. Please DM me to arrange. üòÉ


[14-Feb-19 05:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Lumbi I don't own an fpga but according to Wind, the F1 is 64gh/s @ 440w so ~145.45 MH per watt but that is on the old algo of course so it doesn't really apply. I understand it does for lumber though I just wouldn't want to get off track here or confuse anyone. The new FPGA being discussed apparently gets a watt per MH which would make it incredibly efficient


[14-Feb-19 05:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @CryptoYeti yay!


[14-Feb-19 05:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> Yeah. Verushash V2.0 was developed by @miketout specifically to close the big gap that was in there between FPGA and CPU's on V1. This is to ensure a much more fair position for all miners on the verus chain.


[14-Feb-19 05:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yeah the old algo was like 64 of my 1080 ti's. Way outta proportion. This new business model you are putting out in conjunction with the VerusHash 2.0 balanced design algo has an opportunity to reshape the cryptospace for the positive and help spur on a much needed change


[14-Feb-19 05:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Pretty psyched bout it tbh. Really proud of y'all and the cooperation that you've shown. Thanks! üòÅ


[14-Feb-19 05:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Never thought I'd be an FPGA owner either but here I am.. hah


[14-Feb-19 05:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> And that is how real, far reaching change is made and this actually feels like the first legitimate step toward FPGA mainstream adoption


[14-Feb-19 05:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> My question now is-- what happens if another FPGA dev comes in and blows out the competition again?


[14-Feb-19 05:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Will it be a rehash of the conversation in December? Will Gloryman sell all his VRSC again?


[14-Feb-19 05:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> Everything is possible I guess. But Mike has designed verushash v2.0 to make this considerably more difficult than it was with V1. This is the point of the new algo to very much close the gap down and hopefully prevent any developer from taking over the network with just FPGA's


[14-Feb-19 06:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Patrick ManBearPig oh man that last line truly made me laugh out loud!


[14-Feb-19 06:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - LOUD Mining Dev-Ops> is the FPGA mess-with-able?


[14-Feb-19 06:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I heard that in an announcers voice at the end of a cliffhanger on an action tv show


[14-Feb-19 06:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Good question


[14-Feb-19 06:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - LOUD Mining Dev-Ops> do you need a full xilinx software package to devlop on it


[14-Feb-19 06:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> it will be like the current GPU hashrate over the initial hashrates


[14-Feb-19 06:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> improvements, but not orders of magnitude


[14-Feb-19 06:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> all depends on how close to optimal the initial version is


[14-Feb-19 06:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> maybe it is already 90% efficient and 10% is all that can be gained. if it is only 50% efficient, then in that case we will see double the performance, but from what I have seen I would be really surprised if it is that inefficient


[14-Feb-19 06:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> so i dont expect any more than 25% to 50% improvement over the initial, maybe only 10%. now different hardware might have different performance as we all know


[14-Feb-19 06:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> technically our FPGA card can be used independently, if one wanted to develop for it then yes they would need Xilinx Vivado really


[14-Feb-19 06:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> while all these other coins talk about ASIC resistance and tweak their algo that is fpga mineable within a few days, verushash2 appears to be simply solving the entire issue


[14-Feb-19 06:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> we will be releasing a lot of bitstreams for other algorithms that would be compatible with our verus specific card so people do have the option to mine other currencies.


[14-Feb-19 06:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> All these equihash coins that forked away from asics only to have hidden fpgas mining... üòÇ


[14-Feb-19 06:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> Totally agree on the V2 algo @jl777c  Mike has designed this to make things much fairer for everyone involved


[14-Feb-19 06:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> and yeah. Pretty sure there is private mining going on for equihash variants, ETH, cryptonight, X16r and others


[14-Feb-19 06:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> We're looking at all of these ourselves and planning on NOT keeping it hidden away. But most of these will be on our other much more powerful FPGA board designs using Kintex/Virtex Ultrascale + and also probably some Intel/Altera solutions too.


[14-Feb-19 06:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> @Patrick ManBearPig @LOUD Mining(vrsc.loudmining.com) The source code will become open source, so if you have a vivado license, you could totally play around with it üòÉ . I will also be pushing any optimizations i find to the public repo


[14-Feb-19 06:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cryptonoobie> Is there any upper limit to the number we can install in a PC?  Other than PSU requirements?  Can you put them next to each other in a standard mobo and not have interferences?


[14-Feb-19 06:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> I theory these could be run in standard GPU rigs basically replacing GPU‚Äôs that are not so profitable now


[14-Feb-19 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> This was one of the things we have felt was important from the beginning. It gives an entry point to FPGA mining for GPU miners who want to move forward with mining tech.


[14-Feb-19 06:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cryptonoobie> I just preordered one but then found I have to pay in BTC.  How much time do I have to fulfill payment?  Do I keep my position in the queue?


[14-Feb-19 06:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> Hey dude. There is a small window for the BTC payment due to market fluctuations. I can however cancel the order so you can prepare payment and manually keep your queue position so that‚Äôs not lost if that helps.


[14-Feb-19 06:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> Scrap that. Just updated the system to allow a good few hours for BTC payment to complete. üëçüëç


[14-Feb-19 06:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cryptonoobie> Ok thanks!!

[dscrdvrsc] <cryptonoobie> lol my coinbase pro acct is short 0.002 BTC.  love it when that happens.  I've got some elsewhere..


[14-Feb-19 07:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cryptonoobie> I'm just going to reorder now and let the previous order expire, can you help me with my position after the order is placed?  I want to do it from my PC so I can cut and paste the address.


[14-Feb-19 07:06 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <basti> trading live tomorrow


[14-Feb-19 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Hooray!


[14-Feb-19 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> I will be starting an account soon


[14-Feb-19 10:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> @basti as I understan they will begin with a new trading platform at cryptobrigde, am i right? what confuses me a bit is that they seem to have thier own Agama wallet? version 0.3.4? is this one better than 0.5.5b at veruscoin.io or the same? i have downloaded the walletit looks exacly the same as 0.5.5 and 0.3.4 is also a beta. Wich one to use?  üôÑ


[14-Feb-19 10:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <basti> @fng77 It's best to use the wallet from veruscoin.io. there are you on the safe side


[14-Feb-19 10:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <papacheal> @CryptoYeti @Cuttlebit What are the PCIe slot requirements for the FPGA card? Can these run in risers in a GPU rig or do they require a full PCIe slot to operate? Also, Linux is mentioned as the primary support OS: does this include the Ubuntu 18.04 LTS flavor?


[14-Feb-19 11:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @papacheal I think that was just asked over in mining and it was said that they should be fine running on risers


[14-Feb-19 11:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> Yes, risers are fine


[14-Feb-19 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <papacheal> Sorry, yes, I see what was asked already. Didn't search far enough. Any thoughts on the Linux support: will the bootable image you supply be required, or can we retrofit an existing  18.04 install to support the FPGAs?


[14-Feb-19 11:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> @ukminer17 ^^


[14-Feb-19 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ukminer17> 16.04 18.04 fully supported


[14-Feb-19 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @Patrick ManBearPig this is a great question and I appreciate you using me as a barometer to decide if VRSC is worth holding and investing. Firstly, I would like to say that with open FPGA bounties and development with the community I believe that if there was secret FPGA mining it would be less significant than the previous sniping. Secondly, we can now have full confidence in mike's ability to manage and code a fork if necessary. Thirdly, as the project moves along and more are interested in buying, this would actually create so opportunities to buy before the PBaaS. So, with all these differences in mind, I will not be dumping my VRSC and you can be rest assured that VRSC has the Gloryman seal of approval. üëç


[14-Feb-19 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @fng77 if they are using a different Agama wallet, it is likely the Komodo version. I would have to confirm with @pbca26 that the Komodo version of Agama now supports VerusCoin. If not, the two wallets can at least run side by side, and the Verus enhanced Agama also supports Komodo coins. Until I know that the Komodo release supports the Verus daemon, which I wasn't aware of yet, we recommend the latest Verus Coin version to run VerusCoin. I will look further into this today. Thanks.


[14-Feb-19 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Thanks @GlorymanRTS ! glad to hear üòÉ

[15-Feb-19 01:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> About the UKminer FPGA,  just checked the details and performance.  I think the mathematics used in some upper posts are way missleading and don't show the whole larger big picture of what will happen. While i agree that the MH/s per $ calculation is mostly correct and that's on factor there are way more important ones. The MH/s factor is only interesting for initial hardware distribution or fairness, nothing more, nothing less. After that the most imporant factor becomes the MHs per Watt factor which is absolute in favour of the FPGA's with over x 3.25. Or in other words, the FGPS is 3.25 times more competive. Than we come to the difficutly factor. As the FPGA has a really high hashrate compared to the average CPU hashrate. For example mine. I'am mining with my I7-8700k which is still one of the better CPU's all the time while working with around 6-7 MH/s. Means the FPGA will mine at least 10x more than the average joe user is mining right now, mostly even 15-20x more. This is especially of interest when we consider now the without doubt raising difficulty the FPGAs will cause. Higher difficutly => less mining rewards for the CPU's => less profitability for CPU's which anyway are in many regions allready borderline due electricity prices => forcing out CPU miners. Just logical.


[15-Feb-19 01:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> I hace done a lot of research the last months on various projects and how given approaches lead to mining centralization. Many devs forget that the electricity price per kw/h is the most important one. The higher hashrate hardware you have on the network the more crucial it gets favouring geographical centralization,  beside hardware centraliazation of course. As an example. A german miner for example has to pay around 35 cents per kw/h compared to mining facilities in the inner mongolia region in China for example which have access to 2 cent per kw/h electricity.


[15-Feb-19 01:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> This is important to know when we talk about FPGA's or Asics in general. With high hashrate specialized hardware and i personally consider an FPGA a highhashrate unit small hobby miners get forced out automaticlly for 3 reasons: 1.) Limited access to the hardware. 2.) Limited technical knowledge on how to run specialized hardware. 3.) electricity prices.


[15-Feb-19 01:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Yes. This is apparently a factor. Difficulty will rise fast when these things hit the market. Something I forgot about completely myself.


[15-Feb-19 01:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> Yes indeed, difficulty will increase along with availability of higher hashrate units.


[15-Feb-19 01:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> However CPUs will likely get a good hashrate bump in the next generation. With 7nm Ryzen on the immediate horizon


[15-Feb-19 01:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> And also better efficiency due tot the die shrink


[15-Feb-19 01:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> @fng77  as said allready, i have invested a lot of time in doing researching on hardware and geographical centralizaton due electricity prices. Difficulity is the factor that forces out ALL the miners (expect a handfull hardcore miners) that live in higher electricity regions. The world average electricity price is around 13 cents per kw/h. The  higher the difficulty gets the more miners from higher electricity price regions get forced out.


[15-Feb-19 02:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> @Cuttlebit , i assume the same will happen to the next generation FPGAs someone will build immediatly after it's clear that FPGAs are tolerated on the Verus network. And than again, while eventually, if we take it for given that the next cpu's will have better hashrate, i'am pretty sure they can't compare in MH/s per Watt, and that's the important point.


[15-Feb-19 02:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> Have in mind currently the best Ryzen's are 3.25 less electricity efficient compared to the first FPGA!!!


[15-Feb-19 02:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @boxalex there is also possible improvement in current cpu miners available. We are on very early releases don‚Äôt forget


[15-Feb-19 02:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @boxalex you also mention an 8700k pulling 6-7MHs while I run this and pull 16-17MHs


[15-Feb-19 02:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> And other CPUs like Ryzen and TR being better for mining that are mainstream.


[15-Feb-19 02:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> So we are not looking at 15-20x the performance.


[15-Feb-19 02:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> @Ginasis Mining Pools , how much improvement do you have on CPU mining? You have right now to close a gap of x3.25. Means the Ryzen 5 2600 for example must either mine 17.5 MH/s  at 30 Watt or around 55 MH/s at 65W. That's not realistic. Actually my bet goes that the FPGAs are getting even more efficient with some tweaking....


[15-Feb-19 02:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> Yes, in the performance per department it FPGAs will likely always remain superior


[15-Feb-19 02:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> I said i mine with an 8700k WHILE working


[15-Feb-19 02:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> I can do basically anything but game while mining


[15-Feb-19 02:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> and use only 5 threads, that's what i call average joe mining.


[15-Feb-19 02:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> you can use 8-10 and still have good CPU performance


[15-Feb-19 02:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> @Ginasis Mining Pools , that's you, again, i'am talking about average joe miners that run mining beside working, gaming on their PC. It shouldn't be a question on what's possible for a single person but what the majority average joe miners are doing.


[15-Feb-19 02:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> You cannot hinder progression based on a small portion of a community


[15-Feb-19 02:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> There is always going to be something bigger and better than what you currently have.


[15-Feb-19 02:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> And again, i took the 8700k as an example as i have first hand data for it. If you want, compare it to an i3 whatever version to compare to the FPGA.  These guys literally can stop now mining if difficutly goes up.


[15-Feb-19 02:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> I don't want to stop anything. I'am just adding important information and showing the full big picture in advance on what happens in future. Nothing more, nothing less. I even didn't say don't let FPGAs on, that's not my point or incentive. Others have to make decisions. I just wanted to add more information, that's it.


[15-Feb-19 02:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> I‚Äôd imagine serious miners looking to turn the maximum profit will turn to FPGAs. However the goal will be to strike a balance between CPU, FPGA and GPU miners


[15-Feb-19 02:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> @Cuttlebit , i understand the goal and hence, it's the reason i'am here even and interested in verus. Just my personal opinion is that a balance should be in the range of 1.5. Everything above is disbalance, but than again, that's just my personal opinion. There is exactly 0 chance a miner can compete with a 3.25+ difference factor on efficiency. Leave alone the 2 cent china miner compared to the 35 cent per kw/h german miner.


[15-Feb-19 02:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> I think maybe GPUs need to get a bump which places them in between CPUs and FPGAs


[15-Feb-19 02:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> Morning all.


[15-Feb-19 02:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> Heya


[15-Feb-19 02:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> @boxalex Yes, the FPGA is the most efficient solution for mining VERUSHASH v2.0 but..


[15-Feb-19 02:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> We are not planning on our miners nerfing the network like has happened before


[15-Feb-19 02:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> We are limiting sales to prevent this


[15-Feb-19 02:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> We also have a 6 boards per customer rule to support decentralisation7


[15-Feb-19 02:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> @CryptoYeti , this raises 2 more problems


[15-Feb-19 02:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> Granted, difficulty will be affected


[15-Feb-19 02:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> 1.) limited access to hardware is automaticly favouring centralization


[15-Feb-19 02:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> 2.) that


[15-Feb-19 02:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> but not like it was on V1 by previous FPGAs


[15-Feb-19 02:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> 's your fpga, how will garantee for others?


[15-Feb-19 02:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> *who


[15-Feb-19 02:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> Unfortunately, as much as I would like others to adopt our ethics I'm not sure thats possible


[15-Feb-19 02:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> As said, that's the problem


[15-Feb-19 02:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> totally agree


[15-Feb-19 02:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> which is why we have approached this as ethically as possible


[15-Feb-19 02:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @boxalex thanks for your input buddy. Here is my opinion on the issue. CPU compared to FPGAS
1. The CPU mining has zero investment requirements. You either hand a good cpu for work or gaming. 
2. CPU 60mhs/250w thus .24mhs/watt
3. FPGA 70mhs/80w thus 0.875mhs/watt
4. There for improvement in efficiency is x3 but hardware is about 33% of the price. 
Conclusion, FPGAs are not good enough to kill of cpu mining.

Difficulty changers
1. Firstly, the difficulty changes 33%-50%, based on the big jumps in price, because of the CPU farms from China. 
2. The investment opportunity for the FPGAs is so minimal it seems the effect will be minimal. If 50% of the hash becomes FPGAs and force farms out that will be good and might lead to higher rewards because of less dumping.
Conclusion is that it could go either way with regards to difficulty changes benefiting or harming cpus, but it will be minimal. 

Centralisation
1. With regards to the price of the electicity for getting coins for decentrailisation, its better for cpus to be less efficient so that the hash is less centralised around china's cpu farms.
2. I think that these FPGA make is eaiser for hobbyist miners because these fpgas are for normal pcs and are plug and play. 
3. The efficiency of the FPGA miners actaually makes it easier for people in developed countries to run them to mine verus. 
Conclusion, FPGAs make the hashing power more decentalised.


[15-Feb-19 02:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> Look, i have myself an bigger asic facility and it's the biggest mistake i ever made since participating in crypto. I'am coming from the ZEC community and than back i supported asics, shame on me, as said, biggest mistake. As i saw than back the full impact i decided to research every single impact mining hardware as and most important the impact of electricity prices. Most underestiminate them and than wonder at a given point while the top mining pools are in china and the whole network is dominated by chinese miners.


[15-Feb-19 02:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> dude. Ash (the other founder) and myself are miners too. CPU/GPU/ASIC. We do understand the frustrations


[15-Feb-19 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> this is why as hatrdware devs we are trying really hard to be as ethical as possible


[15-Feb-19 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> Someone was always going to develop FPGA for VERUS. Personally i'd much rather an ethical team doing that.


[15-Feb-19 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> @GlorymanRTS , the inital price has about 0 effect, hence it should be the least important way after difficulty and most important electricity effiency. About the dificutly changes. Based on the FPGA miner with limited availability, maybe, but it won't be only this FPGA for sure. If you give me numbers on how many units are going to be sold for ALL batches i will make a calculation on how much difficulty will raise. As i have even no numbers for batch 1 i hope we get some numers right now.


[15-Feb-19 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> @CryptoYeti , how many units is batch 1 and how many batches are planned?


[15-Feb-19 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> Batch 1 is 500 units


[15-Feb-19 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> We are likely to only do 2 batches.


[15-Feb-19 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> We'll be watching the markets and charts and mostly likely adjust up/down as things pan out


[15-Feb-19 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> No one can stop FPGA's hitting the network again, but I do hope we can do this in a better manner than others have.


[15-Feb-19 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> initial price is important buddy. 0 investment means you can take profit even if minimal. Any other investment is a risk that needs to be paid off. I think that FPGAs for verus are different because miners that are trying to get maximum  profit wont be on verus coin. There are just other coins to snipe that are way more profitable. So, the impact won't be as high. Also, It will mainly be people who are interested in verus coin that get these FPGAs and the will be more likely to hold rather than dump. So, increases in price are more likely and hashrate more secure.


[15-Feb-19 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> 500 of these little FPGAs is tiny!


[15-Feb-19 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> the black miner F1 had thousands of super powerful FPGAs


[15-Feb-19 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> with 10x the chips in each xD


[15-Feb-19 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> @GlorymanRTS , the 0 investment has it's very advantages as well. More miners, more community, more decentralization, fairer distribution, fair harware availability and a lot more. Just as an counter argument.


[15-Feb-19 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> these new fpgas are equal to my cpu. The last FPGAs were like 60 x 1080 tis. Huge difference.


[15-Feb-19 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> @GlorymanRTS , i have doubts you are the average joe miner than....


[15-Feb-19 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @boxalex 0 investment also means that 50% of the hash rate if often Chinese cpu farm dumpers. So, it can go both ways


[15-Feb-19 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> agree, that's the POW problem in generally.


[15-Feb-19 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @boxalex I mine with 2x AMDs and a 2990wx. I literally have a work/gaming station. No specific mining hardware. This will be my first time I get specific mining hardware.


[15-Feb-19 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> So, FPGAs will be better for the difficulty and I believe they will improve profitability for CPU miners


[15-Feb-19 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> I could be wrong, but that is my opinion.


[15-Feb-19 02:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> impossible. CPU miners are getting forced out on higher electricity regions. I didn't make a calculation yet, but my guess is that every CPU miner above 10 cents per kw/h won't stay profitable after 1st batch is online..... Current price in mind.


[15-Feb-19 02:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> just vague, don't nail me on that one


[15-Feb-19 02:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> it's actually and elemtary logical conclusion: The more hashrate => the higher difficulty => the more shifting towards low electricity regions. 100% garantee!


[15-Feb-19 02:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> This is ideal. If we can get all the cpu farms out because it is not efficient enough as you said then 50% of the POW coins wont be dumped. If cpu miners are mining at 0.15 per kw/h, they can accumulate, stake and price will gradually get higher.


[15-Feb-19 02:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> that's not how it works mate


[15-Feb-19 02:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> 100% not guaranteed. You underestimate the 50% dumping and how it effects the price. its just how it works mate


[15-Feb-19 02:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> you can't force out the 2 cent per kwh chinese miner, you force out the average joe miners


[15-Feb-19 02:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @boxalex we force them out every other week


[15-Feb-19 02:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> 150GH falls to 75GH-90GH every time they dump the coin


[15-Feb-19 02:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> You forget that CPU farm miners will mine something else if slightly less efficient


[15-Feb-19 02:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> I don't forget it and i don't have in mind the autoswitching profit miners, which is a problem for itself actually.


[15-Feb-19 02:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> Like i said, I'm still confident about my conclusions made above. FPGAs are good for the project/community and cpu miners.

[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> That's your opinion and that's ok, i have gone through this allready with ZEC with 1000's of hours research done by now. Have always in mind that an FPGA is actually an ASIC itself, no matter we call it here a FPGA.


[15-Feb-19 02:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> I think if FPGAs were only 1.5x more power efficient than CPUs, then no one will get them right? Unless you are running a super farm where every watt saves you big time. With CPUs you have more flexibility, and also better resale prospects if you decide to shut down.


[15-Feb-19 02:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> I mean, CPUs and GPUs are also technically ASICs lol


[15-Feb-19 02:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @Cuttlebit completely agree. I actually think that the investment prospects of these fpgas is so slim that the only people it makes sense for is the people believe in veruscoin long term. This is also a good thing. Any other miner for profit investor would probably buy else where.

[15-Feb-19 02:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> I guess the best analogy for FPGAs. Is it's like an interpreter for hardware. If 'ASICs' are C++ then FPGAs is like python

[15-Feb-19 02:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> @CryptoYeti i wonder, is there a maximum amount of FPGA units per order/person in your first batch?


[15-Feb-19 02:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> @GlorymanRTS , i get where you are coming from and your logic. But from history and experience it's not how it will work (Doesn't exclude that it could work!). From experience it's like: 1.) After you have an initial investment most people want to ROI. 2.) The more volatile a given currency the higher the chance coins gets dumped. 3.) The higher the difficutly the higher the sell pressure to achieve ROI. This said i wouldn't count on that FPGA miners aren't looking for profit and ROI. One good thing with CPU mining is that as there is no initial investment the sell pressure should be lowest.


[15-Feb-19 02:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> or the other way around, have there already been orders of like 100 boards at once?


[15-Feb-19 02:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> He said earlier 500 FPGA for 1st batch, limit to 6 per customer.


[15-Feb-19 02:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> Biggest order is 6 cards. Thats the limit


[15-Feb-19 02:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> From Bitmain experience we all know that these limitations are actually not working.


[15-Feb-19 03:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> even less if paid in crypto


[15-Feb-19 03:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> limit per customer could i suppose be worked around if a customer wanted more than 6, different name/different address/different ip address etc. Its hard to fully control that but we will do our best


[15-Feb-19 03:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @boxalex I appreciate you arguing with me and challenging my ideas. But like I said, the examples you are giving are miners that want quick ROI, those miners wont mine verus coin because there are other coins with higher ROI they can snipe. That only leaves mine and holders, at least to a larger extent.


[15-Feb-19 03:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> total sales is totally under our control and we will pull the whole product when we feel this is appropriate.


[15-Feb-19 03:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @CryptoYeti how many have sold so far? I don't want to get left out?


[15-Feb-19 03:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> @GlorymanRTS , that's a valid argument for the price situation today. We all can agree i guess that we hope verus price will raise soon or late. So in case, hypothetical, Verus raises 10-100x you will get a FPGA flood for sure...

[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> @CryptoYeti , thinking a bit about it. What is the chance some Chinese facility will copy these FPGA's? The uk let's me believe you are located in the UK, means china manufactores would have a bigger price advantage and procuding such FPGAs, not?


[15-Feb-19 03:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> and potentially we could in fact ship directly from china

[15-Feb-19 03:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> another side effect that comes in my mind is that once FPGAs are on the network it wil be nearly impossible to spot other FPGAs, private FPGAs, whatever....

[15-Feb-19 03:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> that's not going to happen anymore. Asics and private facilities have learned by now how to stay under the radar. Best example is monero today with again about 85% asics just discovered the last days....


[15-Feb-19 03:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> then again, monero is a whole different story. thinking 'coinhive' alone tells me enough to stay far

[15-Feb-19 03:19 AM] Gateway#3763

[15-Feb-19 03:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> Time will show how things work out. My predictions based on previous researches, experience and common sense in some points: 1.) Difficutly will raise with the FPGAs for sure. 2.) Mining centralization + geographical mining centralization to come with this, mostly located even more in china and some previous soviet republics. 3.) Less community as the average joe hobby miner will get forced out. 4.) Mostly more sell pressure due ROI. 5.) More FPGA producers to come and/or bitstreams for other models/types of FPGAs. 6.) More attack vectors due higher hashrate hardware and mining centralization. 7.) End of the year, chinese mining pool centralization. Let's  check in some months how much of my predictions have become true üòâ


[15-Feb-19 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763

[15-Feb-19 03:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> There is 1 bitcoin only, but there are about 5,000 altcoins .....


[15-Feb-19 03:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> to me the bitcoin price more is a metric for the overall state of the crypto world more than anything else, tbh

[15-Feb-19 04:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> So we are not looking at 15-20x the performance.


[15-Feb-19 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @boxalex : you forget 1 important factor: more and more households have access to their own solar and/or wind energy, resulting in drastically lowered energy costs. These ‚Äòaverage joes‚Äô will never be driven out, because of mainstream electricity costs. I prefer to use my excess electricity to be used for mining instead of dumping it on the grid for a reduced tariff.


[15-Feb-19 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> more like 1.5x


[15-Feb-19 04:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> @Oink , i don't forget this factor in no way. There are mega minor for the average household user so far compared to the whole hashrate. I will try to find a paper that adressed this issue for 2018 and it was way below 1% of the hashrate used from solar and wind energy. At a level at below 1% it isn't worth putting into into whatever calculation so far, even less taking it as an average. But it is of course an interesting point for future researches IF such setup could compare with <2 cents per kw/h mining facilities that use hydro power in the inner mongolia, Yunnan, Sichuan region in china for example. Or the atom power driven facilities in the former Soviet Republics that have acess to 2.5-4 cents kw/h electricity prices. Of course including the initial investment for these. Just adding here that chinese miners in other regions than the above mentioned are quieting mining at 5-6 cents as they can NOT compete with the electricity prices and facilities in the above mentioned regions. Means there is even mining centralization within china itself, quiet interesting by the way.


[15-Feb-19 04:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I appreciate the answer. 2 comments on that:
1. What percentage of hobby miners is picking up the energy bill themselves (students on campus, teens living at parents, etc)?
2. How much energy are hobby miners using dispersing the waste energy (heat) compared to mining farms? These costs must be factored in if your goal is profitability!


[15-Feb-19 04:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> As soon as China steps away from fossiel fuel based electricity, the situation you described changes drastically (https://theconversation.com/stop-worrying-about-how-much-energy-bitcoin-uses-97591)


[15-Feb-19 04:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> 1. I use solar energy during day and battery at night during summer. 2. In winter it it keeps the house warm so gas bill is super low.


[15-Feb-19 04:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @GlorymanRTS : Same here... I just burn less (renewable) wood...


[15-Feb-19 04:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> Chinese rio chasers are go bankrupt all over the place. Its on the hobbyists and specilative miners that will survive in my opinion. I mean mainly.


[15-Feb-19 04:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> @Ginasis Mining Pools Performance increases on more expensive hardware of course :), but the price to performance is pretty good on the ukminer cards i think


[15-Feb-19 04:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> Interesting points again i have discussed bevor. 1.) There are indeed miners that don't pay the electricity bills for themself, including students, stealing, whatever. Living at their partents does NOT count as the parents pay for it, hence the negative is still in the family no matter the son miner is sponsored. Makes actually sense. There are for sure such mining operation and a wild guess would be it's in the range of less than 1% again due the logical conclusion that more needs more hardware, special electricity setup and so on to get a higher level to have an impact on the whole worldwide hashrates. For sure for young projects like verus coin this percentage could be higher of course.


[15-Feb-19 04:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> No doubt again. To sum it up. the higher the hashrate and difficutly gets the less such miners you have in percent. About 2. That's actually a very missleading argument, mostly coming from previous asic-gpu discussions. First of all many bigger mining facilities are located in anyway cooler regions to limit such issues from beginning, see iceland, north china regions, north india regions, soviet republics, all colder regions. Second, compared to the hashrate output you don't produce that much heat. In my previous mining facility where i used about 75 kw/h the ventilation/heat dispersing power usage was around 1.5 kw/h only in the summer months (4 months and 0.0kw/h in the 4 winter months), just as an example. Now of course the larger the facility the more ventilation needed/dispersion needed. Yes and no without going into further details just let's assume there are some expenses needed. Again, at lowest electricity costs it's cheap anyway. Second and most important, these facilties have cheaper access to hardware than we in europe or the guy in the USA has. No shipping, no custom taxes, no nothing. Count here at least 25% less for hardware. Than these mining facilities get way cheaper prices or even worse, produce them their own way cheaper. If you pay now for an Asic 1,000 US$ Bitmain itself mostly produced it for 200 US$. Same goes for gpu minining farms with special Nvidia deals and i could bet the same with a facility that will build their own let's say 100,000 FPGAs. Now as an additionally argument you could add that these facilities have additionally expeneses for workers and so on. Sure, but these are highly efficient again and beat you. I guess your time has a value as well üòÉ 1 employee is mostly maintaining 1,000-10,000 units of whatever ....

[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> Just my personal opinion on more decentralization and/or preventing dumping coins would be, that shifting rewards more to POS would have a better effect, but that's just me of course.


[15-Feb-19 04:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> Cpus mean that 50% of hash is centralised in one Chinese pool. Fpgas mean that verus community members can buy them and therefore spreads the hash rate accords the world and into the hands of people that believe in verus coin. Fpgas means more hardware is viable, not less.

[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @boxalex I don't agree pos give coins to whales and stops distribution to a wider community


[15-Feb-19 04:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Can‚Äôt we offer fpga with solar panels in 1 deal... ü§£


[15-Feb-19 04:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> If we can make CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs all comparable, that would be ideal


[15-Feb-19 04:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> laugh at me (or dont) but i'm actively researching for some solar panels for mining stuff


[15-Feb-19 04:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> it's more difficult for a whale to accumulate a bigger stake than a mining faciltiy go mine huge portions of coins. Absolutly proofen by the way.


[15-Feb-19 04:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @Oink loud mining have a promotion for 1500 verus, us should check that out.


[15-Feb-19 04:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> well aware of the fact that i'm an idiot being a german and into mining - considering our power prices


[15-Feb-19 04:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @Cuttlebit agreed 100%. We less centralised that way.

[15-Feb-19 04:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @boxalex distributing to newer community members is better in my opinion.


[15-Feb-19 04:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> more stakes for mining, yes please


[15-Feb-19 04:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> suck it miners


[15-Feb-19 04:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> I think at this stage, with the impending next generation CPUs this year, especially with 7nm TSMC and 10nm Intel, CPUs will be getting a bump in efficiency.

[15-Feb-19 05:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> @0x03 I know a couple of people who have built small second hand solar systems and used 18650's for storage for less than $1000.

[15-Feb-19 05:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> @GlorymanRTS , that's pretty unfair. You can do your calculation right now to see how much you have to pay to accumulate let's say 500,000 VRSC


[15-Feb-19 05:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @CryptoYeti I‚Äôll love to have info on that!


[15-Feb-19 05:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @0x03 solar setup for mining?  Talk to jbates about it he runs miners completely from solar/battery no mains


[15-Feb-19 05:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> Calculation and proven are not the same thing buddy  @boxalex


[15-Feb-19 05:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> @Ginasis Mining Pools ahhhhhh thanks


[15-Feb-19 05:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> yes, now it makes sense üòÑ


[15-Feb-19 05:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Obviously your unfounded opinions are much more proven than math, right Gloryman?


[15-Feb-19 05:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @Patrick ManBearPig üòá üòä üëç


[15-Feb-19 05:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Math has been the same for thousands of years, but your opinions change with the day


[15-Feb-19 05:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> it's proven that accumulating whale stakes on POS costs several times more than than the investment on mining to achieve the same level of stake with POW.


[15-Feb-19 05:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Assuming you could get it at the current bid on DP it would cost ~$45,500 to buy 500k verus


[15-Feb-19 05:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> nope


[15-Feb-19 05:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Or about 114 of the new FPGA cards


[15-Feb-19 05:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @boxalex both affect price. Pow distribution means more users that can make the coin more valuable. Pos means that the coins go to a smaller community of whales if pushed harder.


[15-Feb-19 05:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> with every portion you buy the order book changes and price gets higher


[15-Feb-19 05:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Yeah well, you would need to be a moron to market buy half a million of coin this thinly traded


[15-Feb-19 05:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @Patrick ManBearPig ‚úå


[15-Feb-19 05:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <boxalex> buy daily 10,000, price gets up if you want or not


[15-Feb-19 05:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @Patrick ManBearPig appreciate the compliment buddy


[15-Feb-19 05:07 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> Lol


[15-Feb-19 05:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> IMHO: the biggest effect on the price of any altcoin is the fact that you have to trade it, before you can spend it... If VRSC was widely accepted the price would be stable


[15-Feb-19 05:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> that's why Verus is hybrid stake and mine üòõ


[15-Feb-19 05:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> You could probably get it from our good friend Devpro for $60,000


[15-Feb-19 05:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @Oink agreed. Making tradable coin and increasing use is better.


[15-Feb-19 05:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> So instead of bickering over the (de)centralization one should focus on acceptance


[15-Feb-19 05:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> .... if anybody needs to have a website hosted or similar, i will gladly accept VRSC.


[15-Feb-19 05:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> just sayin'

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> What the heck  @GlorymanRTS!


[15-Feb-19 12:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Jk. I'll miss him too


[15-Feb-19 12:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I hope he was kidding


[15-Feb-19 12:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> He wasn't


[15-Feb-19 12:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Could have just burned himself out with crypto


[15-Feb-19 12:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I know that feeling


[15-Feb-19 12:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> CryptoBridge... get ready for the dump


[15-Feb-19 12:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I don't think most of the crypto community gets that there are community members, with what they would consider, little to very little crypto. I'd put myself in that category. I think Stretcher was in that boat too. 
I like him though. He likes Verus & crypto, a lot.
Sad to see him go.


[15-Feb-19 12:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @jimboscott Why so?


[15-Feb-19 12:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Just seems it always works that way...


[15-Feb-19 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Funny thing - over the last 6 hours I have staked 5 blocks - that is WAY above expectations of 1 block per day at best.


[15-Feb-19 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Wonder if people moving to exchanges in that kind of numbers that makes staking less difficult.


[15-Feb-19 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Well it's funny you should say that because I have been staking higher than usual lately but the last couple of days I've only hit once so it could simply be luck or in my case a lack thereof. I wonder about that though myself. It makes sense but if so itd be in our favor to hold anyway unless it really dumps but I think the dumpers have already been doing so and most here I like to think are holders and understand the longer term value of the project


[15-Feb-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Nice to know that my lack of luck is making others happy at least! I‚Äôm way under average. Nothing wrong though. ^^


[15-Feb-19 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @zpajk me? I was trying to be reassuring, sorry if it came off wrong. What I meant was it could just be a random swing of luck too as I've been on a dry spell myself in the staking department but it wasn't so bad just a few days ago. So while you were wondering why rewards were higher than usual, I found it funny because I was thinking they were lower based on my own experience recently.


[15-Feb-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> @zpajk remember _your_ luck when we did your pool. üòõ

[15-Feb-19 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> OoO now I wanna know.. I like lucky stories. Mine here was the first mined block I hit in the solo days within the first couple of hrs. Thought it was the norm and I left it on while I went on vaca for the whole week without a hit, only to find out when I got back just how lucky it was


[15-Feb-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> he wanted to learn how pools worked, i showed him.


[15-Feb-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> we were...about done, i logged off his premises, we minded our own business, and with practically 0 hash he hit a block within like... was it 30min


[15-Feb-19 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> well within a time frame you wouldn't even bother checking if anything happened, basically


[15-Feb-19 01:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Oh, sry @Godballz, I didn‚Äôt intend to actually sound disgruntled. I fully understand the ups and downs of luck. üòÑ

[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @Cruz#3678 I am also in the bracket of not much crypto. I was always trying to give stretcher a little boost every now and again because he was the best at finding projects and teaching me stuff, such a great guy. It's a pity it wasn't more financially rewarding for him. We new more people like him and less shrewd businessmen, it makes crypto so much better.

[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> I know we use AVX when mining in nhegminer, read a little about AVX at wikipedia. Then there is AVX2, Does that make any difference in hash rate? And question about AES, some cpu:s are have superfast MB/s in AES benchmarks, is that used by miner, the speed i mean? or is it just needed and the mining speed only depends on cores, ghz and cache?


[15-Feb-19 11:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> @fng77 You need SSE2 for "_mm_xor_si128", PCLMULQDQ for "_mm_clmulepi64_si128", SSSE3 for "_mm_mulhrs_epi16", AES-NI for "_mm_aesenc_si128 "


[15-Feb-19 11:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> As far as I know you don't actually need AVX for mining Verus, but I read that nheqminer might need AVX to work on linux?

[17-Feb-19 09:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> There is no requirement to do anything with z-addresses on Verus. We do recommend moving funds to Sapling addresses for performance, but there is no requirement or announced timetable for depreciation of old z-addresses on Verus, and we have never announced anything like that. I believe on Pirate, the deadline may have been Feb 15.

[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Hey, @miketout ; I'm a few days late with this, but I thought your take on a very interesting discussion from earlier was much needed. Boxalex and another community member were going back and forth on the topic of how fpgas in electricity cheap regions (among other factors), leads to an inevitable centralization of hashing power in areas like China's inner Mongolia, or someplace like that, in spite of the cpu equalization. @boxalex  made some very interesting points (and admirably kept the conversation mature), and seems to be coming from a place of experience. Basically, his argument is, cpu equalization is woefully inadequate if you don't have equalization of the cost of electricity: if a cpu in Berlin runs on electric costs that are 10-15x's more expensive than fpga/cpu farms have access to in parts of China, the code sadly doesn't matter (in preventing centralization), regardless of how ingenious; the cost is inherently too prohibitive and in due time, most of the mining of the coin would be coming from a very specific region, and voila- Centralization. Thanks for your time, @miketout.

[18-Feb-19 06:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> @miketout- above is a screenshot of @boxalex 's summarizing statement, so to speak...


[18-Feb-19 07:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Well, I don't think the Verus team can do anything to equalize electricity rates around the world so what is the point of the conversation?


[18-Feb-19 08:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> That's like saying I don't think a crypto dev team can do anything about government monetary policy or censorship, so what's the point? The point is developing an effective solution to the problems facing the world, in case you haven't been paying attention. This is a potential obstacle to Verus' stated goals, hence the point of the conversation is what is Verus' plan to overcome or circumvent it, if they indeed agree that it's an issue. Verus couldn't control secret, unethical fpga mining could they? Did they ask what's the point? No, they did what they've always done and came up with Verus 2.0 along with all its innovative solutions to the problems at hand, regardless of the fact that they couldn't control other actors' actions. So the POINT of the conversation is doing what can be done on the part of Verus to prevent this potential of crippling centralization from derailing the entire mission.


[18-Feb-19 08:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> well i think a part of the solution is PoS right?


[18-Feb-19 08:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> since PoW is inherently dependant on cost of electricity


[18-Feb-19 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I think he means further adjustments to the algo to bring CPUs closer to 1:1 with FPGAs but I'm sure that would come with it's own drawbacks such as exposing us to more expensive and out of reach FPGAs and ASICS because the methods used to make it more difficult for FPGAs would make it so only a few could have access down the line. I believe the current algo was designed to create as close to balance while not using some common techniques like requiring expensive ram that other projects chose to use. The FPGAs for those projects are much more expensive. I do agree with as close to 1:1 but not at the cost of much worse centralization further down the line


[18-Feb-19 08:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yeah and PoS helps A Lot


[18-Feb-19 08:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> @Godballz If you make the algorithm memory hard, then CPU won't stand a chance until we get HBM on CPUs. So i think the current solution is a nice balance


[18-Feb-19 08:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> It would increase the efficiencies of GPUs, decrease CPUs and force more wealthy miners to use higher end FPGAs


[18-Feb-19 08:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I agree.


[18-Feb-19 08:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @jintaa its an important topic to discuss and I found @boxalex comments interesting but I don't agree with him.


[18-Feb-19 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @Godballz no one would use fpgas for mining 1:1 because of hardware cost. Also, fpgas decentralise imo because it puts the chinese cpu farms out of business.

[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> well there are also FPGA farms too, ideally no one gets put out of business üòõ


[18-Feb-19 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> All I said was a clarification on what the other dude said if you read what I said I said that the developers likely chose the algo for a good reason


[18-Feb-19 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @Cuttlebit fpga has max 6 selling. Also, its so inefficient that i doubt anyone would build a verus fpga farm on a large scale


[18-Feb-19 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @Godballz oh i see, cool bud i get u

[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> my bad


[18-Feb-19 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> Yes that's true for the ukminer boards, tho with the code being eventually open source, there will ports to other boards in time


[18-Feb-19 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @Cuttlebit but i still doubt they will be as efficient and therefore likely to farm something else


[18-Feb-19 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> @Godballz Yea the algo was a major pain to work with for FPGA lol >.>

[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @miketout have you considered making the code exclusive for like 6 months to give a chance for ukminer to sell his hardware a limit the a potential immediate jump in difficulty in verus fpga mining ?


[18-Feb-19 09:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Any solution that relies on appealing to "better angels" and "have you no shame" tactics is dead in the water. That's not how competition in an open market works, regardless of your personal feelings or morals. I'm flabbergasted at how people don't get this. The only viable solutions are ones that optimize the equality of the playing field as much as possible for everyone, and then let's them have at it. If you think pleading with hardware devs "please! don't sully my beautiful crypto vision with your greedy end runs!!" is even marginally  effective, you don't know how this works. We've ALREADY seen this play out just a few weeks ago- Mike Tout tried to reason with the secret miners and they chose instead to continue making profits (shocker!). That's the whole reason why the team was forced to implement VerusHash 2.0. It's just how markets work, and more importantly, how human psychology/society works.


[18-Feb-19 09:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @jintaa you're right. There's no way to control people and it is human nature to look for an advantage, so really it is up to the code to try to equalize things as much as possible and idealistic visions are just that- idealistic, but I do still believe it is good for developers to keep site of them and always keep them in mind and I think that is what we have seen so far here, more than in most projects. Just as it is natural for people to seek advantages, I think it is natural for this type of conversation, and even healthy in the right context


[18-Feb-19 10:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I think much of the conversation is naive at best


[18-Feb-19 10:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> How can anyone be surprised? You can't release something open source then say "but oh don't use it!"

[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Hopefully no more time will be wasted with the whack-a-mole game, and development on things which will actually improve the coin will ensue-- such as a way to meaningfully protect our stakes!


[18-Feb-19 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> @Godballz I agree 100%- we shd be clear eyed in understanding the inescapable influences of human psychology whilst also keeping hold of our own scruples and ideals.

[18-Feb-19 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> well, there could be a solution to make it more distributed among small miners and much less profitable for mining farms ... and it's similar to PoS:
1) allow only solo mining
2) when a miner finds a block, it will be blocked for 100 blocks (just an example) before it's allowed to find another block
3) new addresses must wait the same number of blocks befor they are allowed to find a block.


[18-Feb-19 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> or, as an alternative, all blocks found in between might as well be distributed to the whole mining and staking community, so all would at least benefit a bit.


[18-Feb-19 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> in this case, even pool mining could work


[18-Feb-19 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> or, another idea, there could be a third way to mine: PoC (like Burstcoin does). 
...
And this gives me some more ideas what could be established by VerusCoin ... got to write them down... will post them when I think they're ready to.

[18-Feb-19 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> I've made some half ass efforts but honestly everything is written for GPU


[18-Feb-19 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> the other problem is that you can't tune Xeons, the GPU guys can downclock to save a ton of money on power


[18-Feb-19 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> The phis are hungry no matter what, and if you're using the memory a lot it just gets worse


[18-Feb-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> there's really just no algos out there that are both computationally intensive AND memory-hard, it wouldn't make much sense to design that way


[18-Feb-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> fair enough


[18-Feb-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cuttlebit> you can't downclock the core and leave the uncore untouched?


[18-Feb-19 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> Xeon Phis are great. The socket based ones are a little limited but the PCI-E Knights Landing cards with MCDRAM are amazing just tricky to work with, in a way they‚Äôre halfway between a GPU and a CPU, but much more GPU like. Definitely some potential but I think Intel is phasing them out now.


[18-Feb-19 06:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> @CryptoYeti technically the x200 coprocessors were never officially released

[18-Feb-19 06:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> the socketed 200 series are essentially identical however, including the AVX512 instructions and MCDRAM


[18-Feb-19 06:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> @Cuttlebit AFAIK they are frequency locked like most Xeons, I didn't see anything in the BIOS that would allow me to change frequency


[18-Feb-19 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> Yeah the 200's hardly ever come available. Ive traded in datacentre and exquisite datacentre stuff (the stuff no one else deals in) for 15 years now, seen considerably more FPGA's than Phi's come though my hands

[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Hey, @miketout , I know you're crazy busy with work, but do you think you can take a few minutes to address concerns/issues some community members have been discussing over the past week? I wrote up a whole summary and properly formatted query a couple of days ago, sorry, can't go over it all again, but I'll copy paste the main question I had, thanks.


[19-Feb-19 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Hey, @miketout ; I'm a few days late with this, but I thought your take on a very interesting discussion from earlier was much needed. Boxalex and another community member were going back and forth on the topic of how fpgas in electricity cheap regions (among other factors), leads to an inevitable centralization of hashing power in areas like China's inner Mongolia, or someplace like that, in spite of the cpu equalization. @boxalex  made some very interesting points (and admirably kept the conversation mature), and seems to be coming from a place of experience. Basically, his argument is, cpu equalization is woefully inadequate if you don't have equalization of the cost of electricity: if a cpu in Berlin runs on electric costs that are 10-15x's more expensive than fpga/cpu farms have access to in parts of China, the code sadly doesn't matter (in preventing centralization), regardless of how ingenious; the cost is inherently too prohibitive and in due time, most of the mining of the coin would be coming from a very specific region, and voila- Centralization. Thanks for your time, @miketout.

[19-Feb-19 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> I want to note I disagreed with this. I think equalization will bring hardware to a higher variety of people. I also thing that renewables and efficient homes are better than big farms. Just my 2 cents.


[19-Feb-19 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <markv> Is UKminer legit? I mean I dont wany to send $399 and lose my hard earn money..


[19-Feb-19 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <markv> What's  the best cpu processor for Veruscoin?


[19-Feb-19 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @jintaa it's really a complex subject with contradictions actually inherent in the concerns themselves. Additionally, the economics that will drive these behaviors are really only things you can assume at scale, which we don't yet have, and which when we do, will have other decentralizing factors in place, and maybe even a differently tuned VerusHash algorithm. For example, when people invest in FPGA mining, which will be more power efficient, the cost of direct Verus mining will go up for all, and CPU farms, as they continue to mine, may start to concentrate in specific geographic regions, which should not be equated to the kind of organizational centralization, which is seen as a potential concern for security. At the same time, there is an interesting other effect -- since FPGAs are actually more power efficient, as professional CPU mining seeks geolocation with the lowest power costs, FPGA miners have an easier time competing from anywhere in the world.


[19-Feb-19 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Now, when you consider what is coming with PBaaS, the ability to make money on all sorts of projects that use the Verus system through mining and staking, that earning potential itself will have the effect of more decentralized mining on Verus and other projects in its ecosystem simultaneously.


[19-Feb-19 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> For example, the current PBaaS work will enable a combination of merge mining and stake-based contribution to PBaaS chains that scales and allows PBaaS projects to start up and offer earning to miners and stakers, as long as they are also mining and staking Verus. This means that each miner will be able to both mine Verus, and currently (could change before even early release) up to 8 other PBaaS chains of their choice at the same time, each hash being leveraged across all 9 chains.


[19-Feb-19 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> every miner or staker could choose to participate in these projects or not, and the combination of projects they choose to mine and stake could be different for every single miner and staker if there are that many live projects running. Most often, miners and stakers will choose projects to support based on profits, but often people will choose projects to mine and stake along with Verus because they believe in the project, bringing new people constantly to the Verus ecosystem and providing more decentralization incentive through that as well.


[19-Feb-19 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> If we find that there is an issue in imbalance based on VerusHash 2.0, I believe that the work we did there, which was originally targeting a more modest equalization than we have achieved, could be adapted for further equalization. Right now, there are new generations of CPUs coming out, and we have yet to see how FPGA evolves. To the extent I have concerns about the potential impact of FPGAs on decentralization of the network and growth of Verus as a whole, I believe we should consider these factors as data to inform our decisions going forward. I think UKMiner and Cuttlebit have done an incredible job developing their FPGA designs in an open and community friendly way, and Cuttlebit has also expressed interest in helping the community support additional hardware types or possibly even providing feedback or help on algorithmic tuning for the best network health and decentralization over time. Where we are now is a far better position than we were when the first FPGAs came out, and none of this particular round of discussion takes the PoS component, which is 50% of network validation, security, and distribution into account. I have recently heard from people who have been accumulating during the recent drops, and by doing so, they are participating in another form of decentralization that will contribute to health and security of the network as well.


[19-Feb-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @markv my personal opinion is that @ukminer17 is legit, and I believe @Cuttlebit , who did the bitstream work has engaged the community with high integrity and a very helpful technical approach, not limited to FPGAs. Neither the Verus Coin Foundation, nor I have any affiliation with or compensation from UKMiner, and that is just my personal opinion based on how they were first recommended to us and their work and open cooperation all the way through.


[19-Feb-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <markv> Thanks Mike! I'm noob here, can u pls tell me what's the best CPU to mine Veruscoin?


[19-Feb-19 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ukminer17> the AMD Ryzen 5 2600 has a pretty good price/hash ratio


[19-Feb-19 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @ukminer17 is right about that CPU being the best price/perf that I've seen recently. It's not the best performance of all choices, and some of the newer CPUs have yet to be fully optimized, but from those easily available, it's best bang for the buck and the example we used to determine that the UKMiner V1 is just over 1.5x price/performance. All of the Ryzen or threadrippers seems to be ahead on price performance over other CPUs right now.


[19-Feb-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <markv> Thank you both!!


[19-Feb-19 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Thanks, @miketout, for that reasoned and knowledgeable response. I know no one has a crystal ball here. And when you consider the kind of community member/investor who's still anywhere within a hundred miles of crypto after the year we've had, honestly, I have to admit I think some ppl- I'll even include myself- might be in a little more need of certain reassurances as they conduct their research and due diligence....I continue to support Verus. I wish us all the best on this continuing journey.


[19-Feb-19 10:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> One thought that I have about the fast raise in VRSC value the latest, could that be connected to the release of the FPGA miner? More people getting interested in VRSC now with introduction of a effective miner? I could of course be wrong.

[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Yes i have been seeing that too


[20-Feb-19 12:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> summer vibes maybe üòõ


[20-Feb-19 12:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Difficult technical analytical stories about bitcoin value, predicted the bear market would turn into a bull market. Which is happening now... Doesn‚Äôt explain the rising VRSC-BTC rate, though. I imagine the recent press releases have drawn some interest...


[20-Feb-19 12:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> vrsc/btc has been pretty flat for a while. Spikes to 3k, drops back down to 2500 sats.


[20-Feb-19 12:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Pretty much since the beginning of December


[20-Feb-19 12:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> If you take out the big pump between October and December it's still up a decent amount from initial trading in August


[20-Feb-19 12:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Since there is no vrsc/usd markets it's pretty pointless to look at any usd figure


[20-Feb-19 02:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <markv> Question: WIth the current hashrate approximately how much VRSC you can mine a day using Ryzen 5? Thank you!


[20-Feb-19 02:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> My ryzen5 2600 @4050 MHz does about 3.5-4.0 VRSC per day on ginasispool...


[20-Feb-19 03:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Any big accumulator of vrsc that is happy with selling at 2500 sats or above will continue to keep the price down, until buy volume increases enough to drain that sell will, which may or may not be to cover costs. The current ‚Äúvalue‚Äù of vrsc is highly speculative.


[20-Feb-19 04:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <markv> @Oink, thanks! How about staking. Let's say you have 100 Vrsc how much you will earn when you stake?


[20-Feb-19 06:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> @markv mining questions should be directed to #mining

[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> So I believe fears about centralization abroad and due to FPGA is highly overblown


[20-Feb-19 09:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> there's a counterweight in terms of capital availability and cost of capital


[20-Feb-19 11:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Miners need to sell eventually to recoup capital expenditure. Someone needs to buy. They can stake.


[20-Feb-19 11:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I want to stake, so I buy

[21-Feb-19 06:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Is it an old time locked reward or do you want to know how long until a staked reward becomes mature?

[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> so agama needs to run while that happens

[23-Feb-19 06:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jonske1> I sent 6k verus before it went in to maintenance... not received... gone from exchange... sitting in limbo somewhere...


[23-Feb-19 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @jonske1 I have a question to them outstanding


[23-Feb-19 08:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jonske1> Yeah I have emailed them and asked in their discord. Even though it was sent prior to the wallet maintenance I'm told I have to wait until wallet comes back online...


[23-Feb-19 08:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jonske1> Over 2 days now.


[23-Feb-19 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> @jonske1 from experience with Pirate, it will show up.

[dscrdvrsc] <markv> Anyone here had deposit  issues with Digital Price Exchange? I think that exchange is a scam.


[23-Feb-19 11:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> In the last 6 or 7 months, I've never heard of a withdrawal or deposit problem that wasn't resolved quickly, and what I have heard of was rare


[23-Feb-19 11:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @markv firstly, dp has worked perfectly with me. Secondly, u can talk directly with the developers on their discord if u have a problem.


[23-Feb-19 11:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I have made quit a few deposits of BTC and VRSC to dp without issue. On the other hand, that is what everyone says until they have a problem. I had a withdrawal from liqui.com take 28 days last year, with no response from support. Everyone just blew it off and said they never had a problem... look where liqui.com is now


[23-Feb-19 11:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> So far though I have been pleased with DP since I started using it in September


[24-Feb-19 12:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Railrain> When I made my first deposit VRSC attempt about 6 months ago, I was surprised to find out via support that the deposit starts in 15 minutes after your transfer - if you mean this, @markv  - In the trade interface, they are not indicated anywhere. üò¨ 
The current experience of the ARRR deposit has shown that twenty confirmations start to count in ~ 30 minutes after your transfer.üòï


[24-Feb-19 03:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yeah, I've used Digital Price for months without issue and have actually had one of the better exchange experiences there. I remember contacting them for a similar issue and not only did they get back to me promptly but they did so to notify me that the issue should be resolved and when I checked, it was.


[24-Feb-19 04:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> they're probably not scamming people. i had one or two sparrings with their support i wasn't a huge fan of, but DP definitely is one of the less-trouble-giving exchanges.

[dscrdvrsc] <wistar> @markv: I have used DP extensively since last July and it has been very good. I had one issue where some withdrawals were marked as "rejected" but they responded nearly immediately to an inquiry and all was resolved in the space of an hour or so. I have asked general questions of their support team and received quick responses. They are as good an online service as any I have ever used and better than most.

[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> *We have just made the announcement for immediate availability of VerusPay, WooCommerce payment gateway, written by Verus community's own @John Westbrook . As far as we know, this is the first self-sovereign payment gateway that supports optional private Sapling payments as well. Here are the Reddit and Twitter announces so you can spread the word.* 

Very proud of the team for this accomplishment.  We were working on this recently but our solution was not elegant like this.  Very well done Verus Team, @John Westbrook for the Gateway and @michaeltoutjr for VerusPay.

[25-Feb-19 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Vycid was thinking about your theory of FPGA purchases redirecting funds that people might otherwise use for buying, and it's actually pretty interesting in a couple ways. First, I agree that at least temporarily, until velocity of the money supply evens it out, it is likely to have such an effect if the sellers then sell Verus and keep none. At the same time, one interesting thought that came to mind is which would get you more mining/staking power, an FPGA for Verus or the Verus itself? Over the long run, the answer should be that you would earn more by spending it to buy the FPGA, or someone else is getting the better deal.


[25-Feb-19 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> @miketout yeah, that's an interesting question. I know for sure that the 50/50 split is definitely very supportive of the price. Usually the triple-digit annual inflation rates will sink new coins before they can take off


[25-Feb-19 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> There's probably some equilibrium point, where the competition over the hashrate reaches a point where it's better to stake. But every time a new generation of hardware comes out (in this case ASIC) that equilibrium is disrupted and you get some capital outflow


[25-Feb-19 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That's funny, I was thinking about that too. Staking the same amount of Verus extends the catch up time somewhat. That is a good point you two make, not only are funds temporarily redirected to the device sales but the sellers are going to be converting as well which would have a double whammy effect. Considering this, it isnt too bad a drop and I'll be interested to see as time goes on a likely good rebound effect since things still seem to be holding up pretty well, bear in mind the whole market is a bit wonky at the moment


[25-Feb-19 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> Ice Lake with 512 bit CLMUL could potentially be another disruptor


[25-Feb-19 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Vycid yes I'm very interested in seeing what Ice Lake can do as well


[25-Feb-19 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Especially against the rumored 64 core AMD offering


[25-Feb-19 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Buying equipment for mining increases your risk exposure though. Especially specialized equipment. How long will an FPGA retain any resale value? Depends on the market. Also depends on competition. If I buy Verus, I eliminate everything but the market risk.


[25-Feb-19 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> For the cost of the ukminer I could buy about 4300 verus. And with swing trading I could probably turn that into 5-6000 in a short time


[25-Feb-19 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> can't put the ukminer on a credit card either to spread out the capital expense


[25-Feb-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> Wow, UKMiner doesn't have a credit card processor?

[25-Feb-19 05:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> You are excluding a lot of potential customers by not taking credit cards, particularly considering that they are basically a financing option for people


[25-Feb-19 05:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> Mining hardware is essentially a business investment, not a personal purchase


[25-Feb-19 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> Of course accepting cards opens you to up to all kind of bullshit like chargebacks. Then again, I am more inclined to trust companies that aren't afraid of chargebacks than those that clearly are


[25-Feb-19 05:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> Crypto is trustless, pre-orders aren't. I will never again pay for a pre-order with crypto - learned my lesson there. But a credit card? Sure, I'm protected


[25-Feb-19 07:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I have no issue with them not accepting cards, but the point you are trying to make @Emmanuel would be stronger if they were not pricing the cards in fiat.

[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Well at one point there was a massive miner that accounted for a lot of the hashrate. They could have accumulated an amount up there


[26-Feb-19 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I believe that may be Supernet, if I'm not mistaken. As with everyone else, all mined, staked, and/or purchased coins.

[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> What's Supernet?


[26-Feb-19 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> As I understand it, it is a Komodo ecosystem basket of sorts. They have been mining, staking, and sometimes purchasing from the beginning.


[26-Feb-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> SuperNET became Komodo Platform.
There is also the SUPERNET asset, which is a fund, and a komodo assetchain.

[dscrdvrsc] <TheDruid> may I ask what was the price of VRSC at launch ?


[27-Feb-19 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Speculative


[27-Feb-19 02:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> No pre-mine or pre-buy. So I don't know what's of interest to you.


[27-Feb-19 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TheDruid> so the only coins available are the ones who were mined ?


[27-Feb-19 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TheDruid> what's the price ATL ?


[27-Feb-19 02:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> 2000 sats is pretty much ATL. I may be bias, but it doesn't say much because of the low volume.

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Patrick ManBearPig our big focus right now is completing the first PBaaS release. that's a big baby, and I suspect you'll be happier with that than you would with hardware staking when it's out üòÉ please let me know after the fact if I'm right


[27-Feb-19 10:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I honestly don't even know what it is. Not making any kind of value judgment there, but simply proclaiming my ignorance. On the other hand, I know how F'ed I would be if my VPS/Wallet/Keys and stakes were compromised:(


[27-Feb-19 10:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I realize it's not top of your list-- not complaining-- just curious if in your opinion it is in the realm of possibility


[27-Feb-19 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Patrick ManBearPig that's an easier question to put some thought into. it is not obvious how that would work actually


[27-Feb-19 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> staking is actually processing transactions like mining


[27-Feb-19 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> so, it needs to validate an entire block of transactions and send them to the network


[27-Feb-19 10:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> which is what earns the stake reward. Komodo interest is really just interest. not actual staking


[27-Feb-19 10:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> so, it can happen just with the tx sitting there


[27-Feb-19 10:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I am sure it's not entirely the same with ERC20 tokens, but there are tokens out there which you can earn rewards while your stake is in a hardware wallet. TNT, Smartcash probably others


[27-Feb-19 10:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> but for example Smartcash requires smartnode linked to staking wallet


[27-Feb-19 10:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> thats more expensive than running Agama wallet on your computer


[27-Feb-19 10:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> It seems like there should be some possible way of proving a stake beyond the coins being held in a hot unencrypted wallet


[27-Feb-19 10:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> certainly a chain can be designed to provide passive inflation and distribution of rewards to holders, but to do actual staking, which is rewarding people for their contribution to processing transactions, there has to be some way to validate and process a block. delegating holdings to someone else is potentially doable, but there are centralization issues with that as well, and the staking model we have now contributes in an important way to decentralization that will be even more important with PBaaS


[27-Feb-19 10:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> Verus is using just a different approach, that is more user friendly imho


[27-Feb-19 10:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> proving a stake is the thing that lets you process the block


[27-Feb-19 10:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the block still must be processed by someone


[27-Feb-19 10:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> and generally, since we only have transactions and blocks as ways to make a record that others can validate, we need to use them for proof as well


[27-Feb-19 10:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Ok, so just looking at TNT for example, you hold 5k tnt in an ethereum wallet. Run a VPS which is available to process hashes. If your ethereum address does not hold the 5k tokens then you are not eligible for rewards


[27-Feb-19 10:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> but you are running a node which processes transactions/audits etc


[27-Feb-19 10:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> that's more like a master node


[27-Feb-19 10:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> which, IMO, is more a way to push people into holding coins (taking them out of supply) because you have no other use for them, and when people do that, it can temporarily hold the price up


[27-Feb-19 10:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> Could the processing of transactions be separated from the wallet holding the coins somehow?


[27-Feb-19 10:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we believe that with PBaaS, people will have a lot of use cases


[27-Feb-19 10:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> but also yes. there are ways to do that, which effectively would provide a delegated staking function


[27-Feb-19 10:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> I've seen some talk of signing or something or other


[27-Feb-19 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i have a call and then will be focused on PBaaS development. i don't have a way of hardware wallet staking yet without delegation, but i will keep a background thread on it, and we can revisit after PBaaS


[27-Feb-19 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> üëç


[27-Feb-19 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> I can give some feedback from recently started ZEL nodes - big PITA, imho impossible to run for average user. masternodes mainly require some Linux / SysOps knowledge, that is out of reach for average user. and to cover the costs of VPS and sometimes coins locked in a way, that user cannot simply unlock them, if they need them.


[27-Feb-19 10:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> How much is the theoretical average user staking?


[27-Feb-19 10:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick ManBearPig> i have a few different responses to that, but I am too tired right now. Time for sleep


[27-Feb-19 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> depends on amount of staking coins


[27-Feb-19 11:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> it seems leasing the address to another address is what is wanted?

[27-Feb-19 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Here is the excerpt-


[27-Feb-19 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> -PBaaS: or Public Blockchain as a Service is a revolutionary new take on the blockchain as a service model entirely unique to Verus that offers the tools and necessary means to build on and utilize blockchain technology for business or personal use. It is similar to using a web hosting service to build a website with, but rather than having to build one by yourself from scratch, the service provider supplies the basics and handles all the necessary tasks from general upkeep to infrastructure maintenance. Since Verus doesn't rely on a centralized authority to work, there isn't any one single point of failure in the network, so in the event of a hack, power failure, data breach or loss, Verus' system is immune while the other options aren't. Instead of relying on a centralized system, Verus elegantly does work for the public by utilizing the public to do work.


[27-Feb-19 06:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @jl777c IMO, with the delegation approach, it comes down to a decision of whether the loss of decentralization from delegation would be worth the convenience. Some projects do allow delegating your coins only for the purpose of staking, which would be pretty easy with CC's, as I guess you might be thinking with the leasing idea. I've also seen critiques of the centralization of these projects that are hard to argue with. I think there's a real security benefit to having all general users of Verus who have a PC staking as much as possible. I guess doing it with delegation might tend to centralize to the same or close to the same entities as pools and farms, which seems to reduce at least some of the security benefit you get from a hybrid algorithm.


[27-Feb-19 06:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ted> wow,thanks,verus was born almost one year,i really like it,and respect the hard work of the team,believe we will have a great future.


[27-Feb-19 06:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ted> Merge mining,pbaas,and ... must be the future.


[27-Feb-19 06:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Thanks @Godballz for the post and @Ted as well for your support üòÉ


[27-Feb-19 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> No prob and thank you back for all the hard work! Like @ted said, looking forward to PBaaS and merge mining!


[27-Feb-19 08:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> agreed. leasing is convenient and centralizing


[27-Feb-19 11:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TheDruid> Seems the mining rewards is pretty high when we look at the sell pressure ü§î


[28-Feb-19 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Funny way of looking at it. Seeing how the rewards are "constant", and other things are variables. Yet, rewards halving in about 882140 blocks, ~ 1,67 years.


[28-Feb-19 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I don‚Äôt think it would be rewards necessarily, as I think no single party is earning that much. It does seem like some one with bags may be selling recently. We will see if they kick themselves when we finish this phase we‚Äôre on üòÉ


[28-Feb-19 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I just wanted to put these two links here, they're what I've been able to find on some of the subjects mentioned in the announcements and are rather inspiring to read. Gives me great hope for what lies ahead-
This might help to get an idea of what PBaaS could do vs current implementations of BaaS- <https://blog.chronicled.com/the-argument-against-blockchain-as-a-service-platforms-5396cb31077e>
And something sure to get the mining crowd excited-

[28-Feb-19 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Merge mining comes with a risk: if 1 entity gathers the hash power to take over 51%, he will most likely also take over all auxiliary chains...


[28-Feb-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Only if you can be affected by that Verus is immune


[28-Feb-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> How many chains are as robust as Verus?


[28-Feb-19 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I don't think any single piece has been left to chance there seems to be a lot of care and consideration into the design of this project


[28-Feb-19 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Sorry for my criticism. I used to do my proposals to my staff, asking them to shoot it down. That was my way to discover weak spots... If it can‚Äôt be shot down, it must be a solid proposal...


[28-Feb-19 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> No I think a critical eye is important

[28-Feb-19 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @zxd666 PoS rewards will vary depending on the total verus live and staking, More users could be staking thus less rewards for everyone. I have noticed this change within the last couple weeks also so I expect more people have been staking üòÑ


[28-Feb-19 10:32 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Just bought a Pirate coin from @Draeth's new store (<https://physicalcryptocoins.com/shop/>) for Verus using Sapling privacy through the VerusPay plugin. Worked like a chARRRm! And the Sapling pay <--> store "seeing" the payment was under 30 sec

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> OK, I knew this was going to work, but WOW!! @michaeltoutjr and @John Westbrook you guys have worked together to make an awesome purchase experience! I used the VerusPay multi-coin QR code from my wallet home screen. Pointed it at the VerusPay mobile invoice, and one click later, I was done! Best crypto purchasing experience I've ever had.

[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> Yeah, when I tested the wallet with VerusPay I was lifting the phone to read the QR and the split second it could see it it was off to the races! It was shocking in the best kind of way lol. Really great work @michaeltoutjr

[dscrdvrsc] <Jskull04> ah ok


[04-Mar-19 11:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> It is possible with CCminer, but as dude pointed out: it‚Äôs not worth it....


[04-Mar-19 11:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> @Jskull04 just take a look into gpu hashrate channel. Last I tried with my 1080 ti it was about 3-4 MH/s ü•¥ verus is best miner with CPU or FPGA

[dscrdvrsc] <dude> instead of gpu mining you should buy the amount of vrsc worth the price of a 1080/2080 and just stake. You will earn more   With staking instead of mining that stuff with gpu

[dscrdvrsc] <ethacetin> Can someone explain why the Verus monile wallet app wants permission to use the microphone on my phone (as well as a number of other permissions I don't understand such as controlling my phone and being able to access all my storage and write over it and it pleases)?


[05-Mar-19 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @michaeltoutjr can correct me if I'm wrong about anything. as I understand it, it needs storage because it stores data on your phone. I think that one is as simple as that. The audio/microphone is due to the QR code library used needing access to the video camera, which also includes the audio permission. It isn't used for anything by the app, and if you disable audio permission after it is installed it will still work. since it's open source, you can check the source if you have any real concerns


[05-Mar-19 08:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <michaeltoutjr> @ethacetin Yep, the detailed descriptions of the permissions the app uses, and why it uses them are available at https://github.com/VerusCoin/Verus-Mobile/releases/tag/v0.1.3-beta under the "Permissions" header. Any other permissions stated as required in the install screen are either used for the above descriptions, related in some way to the above descriptions, or possibly added by react-native or gradle during building but never used. We're trying to sort those out before official release

[dscrdvrsc] <michaeltoutjr> @Hollowman9000 Nothing seems out of the ordinary, but because the PoS blocks and PoW blocks are statistically 50/50, there's a non zero chance that rarely we'll get a few fast PoS blocks in succession, followed by a long PoW block as the difficulty algorithm adjusts.

[08-Mar-19 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'm surprised no one is talking about the merged mining too, that's no small feat. Consider how mining profitability has become an issue lately and how some miners jump ship every day in search of something else. Now consider mining Verus and while you're at it, mining several other projects at the same time at no additional cost to the miner. Seems like a no brainer choice and eventually with PBaaS projects growing by choosing to be on the most advanced/secure network and miners having options, Verus can become it's own micro-economy that would offer miners/stakers and project developers an alternative that would be very hard to compete with.


[08-Mar-19 11:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Dot get me wrong, but the way I see it is pBaaS  a form of merged mining, since Verus will be the main chain and any pBaaS chain will be an auxiliary chain.... or do I look at it completely wrong?


[08-Mar-19 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Well you'd think that, since they go together so well and it's such an elegant answer to many problems for both but look at Ethereum, if you build crypto kitties on them you gunk down everyone else on the network, with this each chain is independent.


[08-Mar-19 11:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> If you use the asset functionality on RVN you still have to mine RVN and depend on them rather than mine your own project


[08-Mar-19 12:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Basically what this means is say you take Bitcoin and how it uses sha256, now if you had another project that runs on sha256 and merged mining was possible, you could mine BTC and the hashes you submit will have a chance to win the reward for btc and have the chance to hit for the other coin at the same time so this is something very different. Picture mining VRSC and hitting a block for them but also earning rewards for other projects just as if you were mining them.


[08-Mar-19 12:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> .
This is an excerpt from something I found online:
Merged mining works like this, you have two totally separate block chains, they are not related in any way nor does either contain any data from the other. When you mine you generate hashes that may be the solution to the current block, this is very very improbable per hash, its like a lottery where everyone generates tickets until someone finds the winning one. Normally you make tickets and check them against the Bitcoin block chain to see if they are the solution. With merged mining you create a ticket and check it against both the Bitcoin block chain and the other block chain, Bitcoin and the other chain know nothing about each other, they are two totally different lotteries with different winning numbers, you just sent a copy of your ticket to both. Since you are sending the same ticket to two lotteries you increase your chances of winning one or the other. No Bitcoin data goes into the other and none of the other coin's data goes into Bitcoin they remain totally separate, you simply run both the other coin's and Bitcoin clients on the same machine and submit hashes to both networks, if your hash is the solution to the other coin's block you get it's reward, if you hash is the solution to the Bitcoin block you get Bitcoins, its exactly like if you were mining on just one network, except you submit the same work twice."


[08-Mar-19 12:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That in conjunction with PBaaS AND this new merkle mountain range solution that may rival mimblewimble's blockchain shrinking abilities.. Verus is very technically impressive already but it's really shaping up to be something truly special.


[08-Mar-19 12:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yes, I had read all that info and compared it (in my head) with the way pBaaS is structured. Instead of continuously making a chance on both chains, the auxilairy pBaaS chain isn‚Äôt in continuous contact with the main chain: a far more efficient way to lighten the load on the main chain, which is a huge pro, IMHO.
My main reservation on merged mining is that big mining farms will simultaneously gain more control over several chains. Decentralization is at peril, which is IMHO an unwanted scenario.


[08-Mar-19 12:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Well fortunately VerusHash 2.0 was designed to help prevent this by spreading the hash and as more and more jump on I'm sure more people with CPUs will become aware and join in


[08-Mar-19 12:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> True. On the other hand: Merge mining will decrease the footprint mining has on our global energy consumption. (f*ck*ng autocorrect...)


[08-Mar-19 12:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> It shouldn't have any more of a centralizing effect than say ethereum and its erc projects


[08-Mar-19 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That's another huge benefit! On top of the CPU friendly nature of VerusHash 2.0 being energy efficient the 50%PoS is a big deal and now merged mining is another huge step towards reducing that footprint


[08-Mar-19 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> So many angles covered it blows my mind to think how well they all compliment each other


[08-Mar-19 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I don‚Äôt agree. Since a miner is simultaneously mining multiple chains, profitability goes up. Incentive for our cheap electricity areas to focus on those merged mining projects, which in turn centralizes mining to those areas.


[08-Mar-19 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Then again, if Verus would act as the main chain, the present community could aid upcoming chains/coins.


[08-Mar-19 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That is the idea I believe Verus would be the main chain


[08-Mar-19 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I can only see it as being an improvement on what we already have


[08-Mar-19 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> And a much more decentralized one at that


[08-Mar-19 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Since Verus is in my eyes a stable and growing chain, with 50/50 PoW/PoS I feel it would be unnecessary/unwanted to piggy-bag on a bigger chain.... with our CPU oriented algo, we pretty much ensure decentralization!


[08-Mar-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> No no sorry


[08-Mar-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Verus is the main chain


[08-Mar-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That's the whole point. That's why it's such a big deal


[08-Mar-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I used that excerpt from the internet that used Bitcoin as an example


[08-Mar-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Just so you got a better understanding


[08-Mar-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Basically you would mine Verus and have the option to support other projects and earn their rewards at the same time

[08-Mar-19 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Let me put it this way: my first compute had  a whopping 1 kB memory, so any descent program had to be written in assembler, in order not to run out of memory!

[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @Oink  seems we share some nostalgic memories, I still own one of those Commodore CBM 3032 with datasette ... was my first "PC" ^^

[dscrdvrsc] <dakgnosis> Can you launch an ICO project as an autochain on Verus? Or are autochains for fair launch projects only with only option being a premine for funding?


[08-Mar-19 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Not 100% but I imagine you'd have as much freedom as can be permitted in the code.  I don't see any reason for this limitation but someone with more knowledge may be able to give you a better answer.


[08-Mar-19 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @Jskull04 that is someone mining with a good handful of different rigs. They have been a decent loyal miner with ginasis for a while now. Whoever it is, thanks for the support!


[08-Mar-19 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Jskull04> @That_Guy8 so does it look like that when you have multiple miners under the same wallet/ID?


[08-Mar-19 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Correct that is a whole bunch of seperate miners / devices running to a single address.


[08-Mar-19 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Jskull04> Ah okay


[08-Mar-19 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Jskull04> hmmm so this bounty thing right?! if i do it one how do you prove it? and do you just get sent verus?


[08-Mar-19 09:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> @Jskull04 wow, would like to have all those workers üòÅ Are they on luckpool or?


[08-Mar-19 09:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Jskull04> no Ginasis (lowest fees)


[08-Mar-19 09:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Ok!


[08-Mar-19 09:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> I¬¥ve been thinking about its for a while. Whats the positive things when you mine on Ginasis? wonder if you support verus coin community more directly or so, but don't know. Been mining on luckpool as I said, think ist exiting with the "luck" bonus if you find a block. Not much luck for me üòÑ but any way one of my worker found a block the other day and I think I got 2 VRSC as bonus. Its pretty good for me, that more than day of mining with my gear.


[08-Mar-19 09:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> What is the bounty thing on Ginasis?

[09-Mar-19 12:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I‚Äôm sure there will be such a cpu, or at least something close to it listed


[09-Mar-19 12:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Btw I am so new to crypto.   I don‚Äôt understand.  How does a currency get usage and rise in value. .  Y would one use VRSC vs Vertcoin ..    Does it mean anyone can create a crypto .. so interest new world.


[09-Mar-19 12:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Interesting *


[09-Mar-19 12:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Verus is now in stage 1 of its development. You should really read the vision paper on the veruscoin.io website. That‚Äôll give you a clear indication of its growth potential


[09-Mar-19 12:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Most crypto‚Äôs are deflationary. They loose value over time. Due to the potential VRSC has, I think it will be the opposite for VRSC, since you can actually spend the coin, instead f having to exchange them for BTC or ETH


[09-Mar-19 12:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> So we may get early adopters advantage?


[09-Mar-19 12:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Similar to bitcoin Pioneers? Hahahaha *dreams


[09-Mar-19 12:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Should I mine myself or join a pool?  I am going to be a casual MAC miner.  Only do it while working on light tasks on safari.


[09-Mar-19 12:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Tried reading the white paper. I am lost.   Is there a over view or infographics üò¨


[09-Mar-19 12:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Let me assure you them that there‚Äôs a lot of potential in Verus and keep it at that üòè! See my answer in #mining, but for casual mining I would definitely go to a PPS pool


[09-Mar-19 01:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Oh god  @0x03 @Chris - LOUD Mining Dev-Ops, I looked that stuff up thinking maybe I'd find a yummy new meal..

[09-Mar-19 01:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Thank u. @Oink how do I find a pps pool


[09-Mar-19 01:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> @Godballz  ok thanks.


[09-Mar-19 01:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Ginasis is a good pool


[09-Mar-19 01:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> @Oink  do you know of a pool of pool I think they call it proxy pool.  Basically it‚Äôs for e even more casual miners.  Folks at vertcoin recommended me .. I am not sure if it is a common thing.


[09-Mar-19 01:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @SmeLLyArMpiTs Also this is a post I made the other day and it vaguely sums up many of Verus' current strengths and upcoming features but even since then Mike T has made an announcement in the announcements channel to some even newer features like Merkle mountain ranges that are big deals in their own right.
This is the post with summary- <https://www.reddit.com/r/altcoin/comments/awuk55/comment/ehu9y47>


[09-Mar-19 01:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Don‚Äôt know about proxy pools...


[09-Mar-19 01:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Thanks @Godballz I am reading the link now.     I don‚Äôt understand stalking.   I feel like trying out solo mining .. is a few hours a day any good for that?


[09-Mar-19 01:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> @Oink   I think we continue the mining discussion here .. am wondering if I have a native wallet, can I still join a pool?


[09-Mar-19 01:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yeah I'd say pool would be best bet with one cpu


[09-Mar-19 01:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yes you can. You need an external miner for the pool, like CCminer or nehq. They‚Äôre pinned in the #mining channel. You can even use your wallet to do some threads of solo mining and the external miner to do some threads of pool mining.


[09-Mar-19 01:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> If you use the exchange and pick some up you can stake. In very simple terms, staking is similar to mining but rather than having hashpower your chances of hitting a block are dependent on the amount you have in your wallet


[09-Mar-19 01:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Not even my dedicated Ryzen is solo mining... it‚Äôs in Ginasis pool


[09-Mar-19 01:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> @Oink  noted ..   I kind of feel having my own wallet is more secure and also helps verus right?       There is a miner on verus website.  So I use that to mine to a pool to my address right


[09-Mar-19 01:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> @Godballz do u have a recommended reading? I don‚Äôt understand cause I tot the idea of crypto is u get rewarded for mining.  Staking is new to me.


[09-Mar-19 01:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Right... my wallet is also staking the coins I earn, but they get moved to the staking pool Ginasis has, so usually <100 VRSC in it


[09-Mar-19 01:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> And it helps the network, yes.


[09-Mar-19 01:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Is verus wallet and miner open source ie pple can see and check the code ?


[09-Mar-19 01:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> @Oink   Having a native wallet is not demanding on my cpu / bandwidth ya?


[09-Mar-19 01:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Not at all!

[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> @Oink    Just to confirm.  I cannot use the wallet miner to mine pool.  I have to install the verus miner. Right?   ( sorry I know I have lots of questions. But that‚Äôs cause I am very involved!!!! )


[09-Mar-19 01:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Correct


[09-Mar-19 01:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> I am new to crypto and likely only will have one.  I want to be on the right train.


[09-Mar-19 01:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @SmeLLyArMpiTs I believe our very own talented and helpful John Westbrook wrote a staking guide and that can be found in one of the articles on the Medium link I posted above.


[09-Mar-19 01:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> I have looked Monero..  vertcoin.   Etc


[09-Mar-19 01:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @SmeLLyArMpiTs I would say that most people would tell you that's very risky but my bias opinion wants to say you picked a hell of a lucky guess haha


[09-Mar-19 01:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> @Godballz I don‚Äôt mean how to do it. As in an easy concept of it .. heehee.   Want to understand it.


[09-Mar-19 01:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Hop aboard! I think you chose the right train!


[09-Mar-19 01:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> No shortcuts on understanding it: you‚Äôll need to read the Verus white paper to fully understand...


[09-Mar-19 01:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I imagine it's explained in the article but basically the more coins that you hold in your wallet the better chance you have of finding a block so it's similar to mining in that sense but rather than having a hash power you have the size of your wallet competing against other wallets that are staking


[09-Mar-19 01:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yeah really what @Oink said


[09-Mar-19 01:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That really is your best bet and it's a good read you may learn a lot


[09-Mar-19 02:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Btw.  Which is better for a casual miner? PPS or PPLNS or PPLTS  etc üòÖ


[09-Mar-19 02:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> also where do they normally display their fee? I am just checking out https://luckpool.net/verus/   But don‚Äôt see any mention of fees.

[09-Mar-19 02:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> afaict luckpool has the 'best' (in terms of gambling-safety) payout scheme. forgot the name, he mentioned it in #pools a while back


[09-Mar-19 02:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Casual: PPS (Pay per share)


[09-Mar-19 02:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and thats probably also the question you'll have to ask yourself. it's usually a tradeoff between receiving your payouts earlier and not allowing others to 'fuck with prop'


[09-Mar-19 02:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> just checked the luckpool page and found `Dedicated Hardware for Servers; NO VPS!`


[09-Mar-19 02:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> thus less redundancy?


[09-Mar-19 02:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Continuous/dedicated mining: PPNLS/PPTLS... these schemes punish your rewards if you go offline for any reason.

[09-Mar-19 02:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Thank you.    I read the verus notes.  So I understand that since my Radeon 570 cannot mine yet, using the cpu doesn‚Äôt put me at a disadvantage of the Nvidia mates right ?


[09-Mar-19 02:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> usually not


[09-Mar-19 02:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> And once amd miner is up , I can actually mine on cpu AND gpu ?


[09-Mar-19 02:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> if your cpu isn't very weak, that is


[09-Mar-19 02:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and yes, if you have a nvidia gpu and a proper cpu, you can do both at the same time


[09-Mar-19 02:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Some i5 3800. Turbo to 4200 Karbly lake thing


[09-Mar-19 02:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but generally, the 'recent' cpus are more power efficient than GPUs on verushash2


[09-Mar-19 02:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> that doesn't mean you won't be able to score a higher hashrate with a 2080 or whatnot


[09-Mar-19 02:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but it's eating a ton of power in the process


[09-Mar-19 02:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Any idea when AMD is supported ? Where can I follow ..


[09-Mar-19 02:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> I am on MAC


[09-Mar-19 02:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> it's being worked on


[09-Mar-19 02:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> nheqminer is available for mac


[09-Mar-19 02:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> can you just read theveruscoin website


[09-Mar-19 02:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> thank you


[09-Mar-19 02:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Eg. My Ryzen 2600 does 18 GHs, my 1080ti does 5...


[09-Mar-19 02:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> GH?


[09-Mar-19 02:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> MH!


[09-Mar-19 03:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> MH indeed


[09-Mar-19 03:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Erm u misunderstood me.  I know MAC is supported.   I am finding out about AMD GPU ..

[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> I gave up boot camp into windows.  I installed the latest Radeon driver and it made windows 10 unbootable -.-


[09-Mar-19 03:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> AMD is not supported right now


[09-Mar-19 03:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> AMD GPUs are not supported on verushash2 yet


[09-Mar-19 03:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but chris said before he's working on it


[09-Mar-19 03:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Yap I know.  I mean where can I follow the progress..


[09-Mar-19 03:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> details on that: i dont know


[09-Mar-19 03:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> probably in #mining-dev


[09-Mar-19 03:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Ok ty !


[09-Mar-19 03:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> MAC doesn‚Äôt get much love in these leading edge stuff lol.


[09-Mar-19 03:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> GPU isn't exactly leading edge on verus2 üòâ


[09-Mar-19 03:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and: it's way better than before where we "had" to use docker or something to get a miner onto osx


[09-Mar-19 03:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Typical response  I get for ‚Äú  hi I am using an iMac .. I want to mine ‚Äú .. ‚Äú that‚Äôs like a laptop.  Don‚Äôt bother ‚Äú


[09-Mar-19 03:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> LOL


[09-Mar-19 03:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> it's not completely useless for veruscoin


[09-Mar-19 03:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i'm mining with a mbp and an air, amongst other things


[09-Mar-19 03:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> I tried a short run for vertcoin on boot camp w10.   My gpu was 83 degrees lol.   25mh


[09-Mar-19 03:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> yea no


[09-Mar-19 03:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> just get nheqminer for osx from the veruscoin website


[09-Mar-19 03:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> ...your cpu will get hot anyways


[09-Mar-19 03:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but you don't have to fiddle around with bootcamp


[09-Mar-19 03:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> @0x03  wow.  Air even????   U da star !!!     Not doubting u.. just to learn .. how do u know you are not wasting money on electricity v


[09-Mar-19 03:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i am, especially because of the country i'm living in.


[09-Mar-19 03:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> (for that matter,probably any mining is money loss here)


[09-Mar-19 03:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> So this is more like an investment where in future when the value is up?


[09-Mar-19 03:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> that or ideal values


[09-Mar-19 03:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and it really depends on your power prices


[09-Mar-19 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but what i'm saying is the CPUs in these mac notebooks are not useless for veruscoin.


[09-Mar-19 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> in fact, i'm also mining with 2 core i5 cpus


[09-Mar-19 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> these also work


[09-Mar-19 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and 'make a difference'


[09-Mar-19 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> ...2 more. thats 2 thinkpads


[09-Mar-19 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> one x220 and one x230


[09-Mar-19 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but most of us are probably waiting on ukminer.io to deliver üòâ


[09-Mar-19 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> or lets say "quite some"


[09-Mar-19 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> most is probably ridiculously exaggerated


[09-Mar-19 03:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I know I am


[09-Mar-19 03:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> +1 from me


[09-Mar-19 03:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> @SmeLLyArMpiTs you probably want to give #cpu-hashrate a good read and search for your cpu there


[09-Mar-19 03:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Ukminer sells the customised machines?


[09-Mar-19 03:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> an fpga


[09-Mar-19 03:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Ok I may get some frag here but I am really sincere to learn.  I tot the purpose of verus is to level the playing field .. if a FPGA can rack up more coins vs a modern cpu.   Then won‚Äôt it be back to square one ?


[09-Mar-19 03:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Dunno if they‚Äôre gonna release MAC s/w for it...


[09-Mar-19 03:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> they're breaking their legs off to achieve 1.5x of the best available CPU for their FPGA


[09-Mar-19 03:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and the contender, blackminer, is RIDICULOUSLY FAR from achieving their performance in terms of hash/power, but then again you can already rent the blackminer FPGAs for verus2


[09-Mar-19 03:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> so no, FPGAs won't completely fuck up anything either. somebody who wants to own a ton of FPGAs can do a comparable amount of 'damage' probably when he just buys a ton of huge CPUs


[09-Mar-19 03:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> yea. i forgot mentioning you can already have the blackminers for verus2. and to my judgement, it didnt reshuffle the game


[09-Mar-19 03:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Other algo‚Äôs are more profitable on the F1, so most of them stay on those.


[09-Mar-19 03:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> They key is $ per MH.


[09-Mar-19 03:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Not total hashing power


[09-Mar-19 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Key is $/Watt!


[09-Mar-19 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> mainly power consumption for our end of the world


[09-Mar-19 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> As anyone can go out and spend thousands and blow the average miner out he water.


[09-Mar-19 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> yup


[09-Mar-19 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> (hash/watt) * power price


[09-Mar-19 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Yeah but for bounty


[09-Mar-19 03:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> And FPGAs disturbing the ecosystem


[09-Mar-19 03:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> If they was stupid high MH for cheap


[09-Mar-19 03:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Then they would flood the market


[09-Mar-19 03:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> And push out smaller miners


[09-Mar-19 03:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Since they keep a comparable $ per MH (not too much higher) it wouldn‚Äôt kill cpu mining


[09-Mar-19 03:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> yea. 1.5x is the golden ratio for now in terms of hashrate increase. and ukminer said 70w (if i'm not mistaken)


[09-Mar-19 03:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> this gon b gud!


[09-Mar-19 03:21 AM] Gateway#3763

[09-Mar-19 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> you get them from within the wallet


[09-Mar-19 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> sould be an option to get the params


[09-Mar-19 07:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> it says select a source ..  there is . z.cash and veruscoin.io    so i chose verus


[09-Mar-19 07:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> default is fine


[09-Mar-19 07:01 AM] Gateway#3763

[09-Mar-19 07:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> either or should be the same

[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> do not hesitate to hit me up anytime


[09-Mar-19 07:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> can i join your pool now .. or i need to wait ?


[09-Mar-19 07:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> you will need to wait till it gives you an address in the receive tab


[09-Mar-19 07:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> i have one .. it says public and a ton of weird chars .


[09-Mar-19 07:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> thats the one?


[09-Mar-19 07:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> public is the one you will use


[09-Mar-19 07:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> something like ```RQQnQCaooNmBbTxmbNG16RSe935HwFB5om```


[09-Mar-19 07:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> quick question... miner has no GUI?


[09-Mar-19 07:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> it will have a CMD window


[09-Mar-19 07:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> that will spit info out constantly for you to track it


[09-Mar-19 07:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> any idea for my cpu "Kaby Lake" 3.4 GHz Intel "Core i5"    what is the max thread?


[09-Mar-19 07:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> how many CPU cores / Threads does it have?


[09-Mar-19 07:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> it is 4 cores but not sure if there is hyper threading


[09-Mar-19 07:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> get cpu-z


[09-Mar-19 07:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Id guess its either 2 core 4 threads (HT) or jsut 4 cores


[09-Mar-19 07:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> so do ```-t 4```


[09-Mar-19 07:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> if i dont want to max out my cpu cause i am doing some stuff i just do .  -t 3 right?


[09-Mar-19 07:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> or are you on mac or linux?


[09-Mar-19 07:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> mac!


[09-Mar-19 07:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Ok, sorry


[09-Mar-19 07:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> yeah could do -t 3 to use the computer still


[09-Mar-19 07:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> @SmeLLyArMpiTs Whats the model of your Kaby Lake i5?


[09-Mar-19 07:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Kaby Lake" 3.4 GHz Intel "Core i5" processor (7500) with four independent processor "cores" on a single chip,


[09-Mar-19 07:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Nice! I had one of those that I had to sell. You will get a pretty decent hashrate with that one!


[09-Mar-19 07:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> mac is really messed up .. i choose 3 threads but the os is saying the miner is using 200+% of the cpu -.-


[09-Mar-19 07:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> ok, I kind of recognize that.. Dont know from where but do you have some other cpuload info app?


[09-Mar-19 07:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> i found the answer


[09-Mar-19 07:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> how it work in mac


[09-Mar-19 07:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> 100% = . 1 core -.-


[09-Mar-19 07:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> 1 core


[09-Mar-19 07:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Thats right!


[09-Mar-19 07:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> so i am using 2 cores +


[09-Mar-19 07:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Thats how it is. What hashrate do you have with 3 threads?


[09-Mar-19 07:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> 2.49 MH/s (Now)


[09-Mar-19 07:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> is this crap


[09-Mar-19 07:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> hmm thought that one would produce more..


[09-Mar-19 07:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> its wierd cause i was doing vertcoin on bootcamp windows 10 .. i got 25mh on radeon


[09-Mar-19 07:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> what is the acceptable "average "


[09-Mar-19 07:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> its 2.8 now


[09-Mar-19 07:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> 89 watts of power used


[09-Mar-19 07:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> I did see a averge of 5.40 on the 7500, have a look here https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RrSYJDV0Mjj3X-myMC3aQDGkcipivxHsD7ZxJ3r5f_A/edit#gid=201266774

[09-Mar-19 07:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Its not that bad. Ive seen worse üòÉ 0.1333 on one of my cpus. Another around 4MH/s


[09-Mar-19 07:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> but y is it 25mh on vertcoin .. or its apple : orange?


[09-Mar-19 07:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> we cant compare it direct?


[09-Mar-19 07:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> More like pineapple / Handgranate


[09-Mar-19 07:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> 4.22 now


[09-Mar-19 07:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> its wierd


[09-Mar-19 07:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> y will it grow


[09-Mar-19 07:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> isnt it a direct function of cpu


[09-Mar-19 07:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> it goes a little up and down, you have to look at the average rate when you have mined for a while.


[09-Mar-19 07:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> But still at 5MH you will be able to get some verus. Sometimes you have to use what you got. I can agree that the watts is a little high, but at time maybe you can upgrade to something else?

[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> LOL i punch in the figures in the calculator . .   monthly profit . is .    $ -13.91


[09-Mar-19 07:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> I know. But remember VRSC can also rise in value in the future!


[09-Mar-19 07:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> yeah !


[09-Mar-19 07:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> thats what i am counting on


[09-Mar-19 07:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Then ist good to have a couple in your wallet..


[09-Mar-19 07:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> give me a bitcoin style explosion  muahahah


[09-Mar-19 07:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> i maybe dreaming,, but dreams can be good .


[09-Mar-19 07:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> muahahah


[09-Mar-19 07:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> You never know. Mine some and we also have some fun here in the forum!


[09-Mar-19 07:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> lol lowering the monitor to dimmest is now 84 watts


[09-Mar-19 07:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> muahahahaha


[09-Mar-19 07:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> you know .. now i doubt those folks who say they mine casually and still profit ..


[09-Mar-19 07:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> i think it is highly unlikely


[09-Mar-19 07:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> is it a laptop? Mine with 3 therads, do your other work with the forth, surf and so on. Im not sure about profit either just think Veruscoin is a intersing projekt. See you later! must take the dogs out for a walk.


[09-Mar-19 07:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> thanks and bye!


[09-Mar-19 07:45 AM] Gateway#3763

[09-Mar-19 07:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> oh btw guys i can stop anytime i want right? i wont lose the progress?


[09-Mar-19 07:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> the shares the pool has already credited to your address usually won't be deleted


[09-Mar-19 07:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but thats a thing you'll have to trust the pool operators with üòâ


[09-Mar-19 07:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but in this case: i think i can safely say: no you wont lose progress


[09-Mar-19 07:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> am on ginasis


[09-Mar-19 07:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> now is   Shares: 32768


[09-Mar-19 07:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> @Ginasis Mining Pools hello . . do u have a guide on what the terms mean? like luck .. etc


[09-Mar-19 07:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> basically thats the work youve submitted


[09-Mar-19 07:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> once the pool finds a block you will be paid a portion of that block in relation to your shares


[09-Mar-19 07:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> say all shares on the pool equal to 100% then divide the block by total amount of shares and times that number by your shares minus the 0.75% pool fee and that is your earnings for that block


[09-Mar-19 07:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> then it resets and starts again


[09-Mar-19 07:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Luck basically means the AVERAGE time you hit mine a block. It is an ESTIMATE! Don‚Äôt be disappointed if you don‚Äôt mine a block yourself within that period


[09-Mar-19 08:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> The rest as per @Ginasis Mining Pools comment


[09-Mar-19 08:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Luck numbers probs still off as numbers need changing in the pool code to match verus better (Fairly sure this has not been resolved on Ginasis) but it didn't exactly make high priority since its jsut a pretty number xD


[09-Mar-19 08:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> hm, we changed the avg block time


[09-Mar-19 08:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> with the code as is, it won't get any better


[09-Mar-19 08:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> not a lot at least


[09-Mar-19 08:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> there is some in one of the site pages


[09-Mar-19 08:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> the math behind isn't very complicated tho


[09-Mar-19 08:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> in the website folder from memory


[09-Mar-19 08:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> that it pulls from


[09-Mar-19 08:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> or was it somewhere else


[09-Mar-19 08:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> nope, `libs/stats.js` or something üòÑ


[09-Mar-19 08:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> yeah probs that


[09-Mar-19 08:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> I saw it and wanted to fiddle but thought  i best not xD


[09-Mar-19 08:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Will do more harm than good as per usual


[09-Mar-19 08:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> or just go for a rough estimate, nethash/your hash, avg. blocktime is 60s, so you can find out how much blocks per hour on avg you should hit


[09-Mar-19 08:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> the result will be as good as the luck time snomp gives üòÑ


[09-Mar-19 08:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> üòõ


[09-Mar-19 08:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> ```                var _blocktime = 55;
                var _networkHashRate = parseFloat(coinStats.poolStats.networkSols) * 1.2;

[09-Mar-19 08:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> how about diff?


[09-Mar-19 08:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> diff is auto managed by the pool


[09-Mar-19 08:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> and will constantly fluctuate


[09-Mar-19 08:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> no need to worry about that


[09-Mar-19 08:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> @Ginasis Mining Pools  how about Immature ?  whats that.. thanks!


[09-Mar-19 08:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> blocks that are freshly mined or staked will have to mature for 100 blocks before you can do anything with them


[09-Mar-19 08:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> so if i am  Immature: 0.03872614 .  it means i need to wait till it is 100 before i can use my coin?


[09-Mar-19 08:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> not necessarily


[09-Mar-19 08:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> we don't know of how many blocks this immature balance is


[09-Mar-19 08:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but i think it's probably from one block


[09-Mar-19 08:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> It means you have 0,038bla VRSC in immature stakes.


[09-Mar-19 08:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> As soon as those stakes are mature, they‚Äôll show up as balance


[09-Mar-19 08:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Once the balance >= 1, it‚Äôll be paid to your R-address


[09-Mar-19 08:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> thats a pool specific detail ^


[09-Mar-19 08:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> for ginasis it's 1 indeed


[09-Mar-19 08:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @SmeLLyArMpiTs
This mining guide will go over pretty much everything but you'll have to scroll half way down to the pool mining section- <https://medium.com/veruscoin/how-to-start-cpu-mining-verus-coin-vrsc-from-your-laptop-in-under-5-minutes-f69c9aae340e>
.
 And here is a YouTube video that explains how to set up a .bat file inside a miner's folder (obviously you'll have to substitute some stuff with the Verus guide on GinasisMining etc.) But sometimes it helps me to have a visual-
<https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=WIh0tHxMcOU>
.
Here is a site that gives a zcash mining guide but it goes over basics with things such as difficulty and other things but the first link, John's guide will be the most useful for what you're doing- <https://99bitcoins.com/zcash-mining-guide-beginners-pc/>
I'll look for a better one in the mean time but it wouldn't hurt to go over some basics if you are just jumping into things. Lord knows I had to just like, I'm sure, so many of us.

[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Block: 408160 Sun Mar 10 2019 02:31:15 GMT+1030 (ACDT) 11 of 100
Mined By: RSP2BMFTVFVzJwUph6T2fVMK7xvCb4sCKo.m13cn2levcpu .    so this means this block is  89 short!


[09-Mar-19 08:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> yes, but thats also only half of the answer


[09-Mar-19 08:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> as there is dpow happening, and the pool can make it look like the block isn't mature


[09-Mar-19 08:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> when it actually is üòÑ


[09-Mar-19 08:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> so... the short answer: just assume 130, especially when waiting for the red numbers on any pool

[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> can i understand why is there a need to wait?  as in isnt mined coins already real coins?


[09-Mar-19 08:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> @Godballz   thanks


[09-Mar-19 08:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> there is so much to learn for crypto !  makes me feel like a caveman haha


[09-Mar-19 08:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i never asked myself why blocks need maturation time, i just realized.


[09-Mar-19 08:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but it's very probably security/safety related


[09-Mar-19 08:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> In case of forking, it needs to mature for 100 blocks, to make sure you‚Äôre still on the proper chain


[09-Mar-19 08:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> anything after the first notarization after whatever event is very safe.


[09-Mar-19 08:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> somebody will surely correct me on this


[09-Mar-19 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> i am literally goggling the terms u all use.. forks ... etc .  haha


[09-Mar-19 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> so other coins like vertcoin has maturing time too right


[09-Mar-19 08:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> probably every coin


[09-Mar-19 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @SmeLLyArMpiTs I would strongly advise you to read the Verus vision and white paper on the veruscoin.io website. Google the unknown terms in there and in a day you‚Äôre up to speed.


[09-Mar-19 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> to check my understanding .. if i attempt to solo mine by using the wallet..  and i quit 1 hour into it ..  whatever progress i have is lost right>


[09-Mar-19 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> @Oink ok..


[09-Mar-19 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> i tried reading earlier .. was confused


[09-Mar-19 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> hahah


[09-Mar-19 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> will continue


[09-Mar-19 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> thanks so much to all here for the kind answers üòÉ


[09-Mar-19 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Solo min8ng is like: you stake a block or you don‚Äôt. There‚Äôs no buildup in funds. All or nothing


[09-Mar-19 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> i think i am starting to understand .. based on my understanding.. my  Immature: 0.05107928 .  will only go up when the next block is found and my shares counted .. right?


[09-Mar-19 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> and once the 100 block passes for the respective blocks,  it will go into balance!


[09-Mar-19 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> In solo mining, theres no share crediting. you only earn when you find a block.


[09-Mar-19 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> the 'wasted' shares aren't credited.


[09-Mar-19 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> when you (hypothetically) quit mining 1sec before you hit a block, that would be very unlucky, but ...thats how it works.


[09-Mar-19 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> OUCH hahaha


[09-Mar-19 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> @0x03    >> i think i am starting to understand .. based on my understanding.. my  Immature: 0.05107928 .  will only go up when the next block is found and my shares counted .. right?
and once the 100 block passes for the respective blocks,  it will go into balance!


[09-Mar-19 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> am i right?


[09-Mar-19 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> it's not any different for pools tho, they just assume they'll find blocks regularily so they can pay you out üòâ


[09-Mar-19 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but they're depending on finding blocks as well, they just do the maths ahead and tell you how big the fraction of work of that block you committed was, in terms of balance


[09-Mar-19 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> it's not like a pool has a magic 1000 verus balance it can pay out from


[09-Mar-19 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> i read about it ... so call the risk of the pool operator right


[09-Mar-19 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> well, it's not "risk" less operating a pool


[09-Mar-19 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> way before something like that comes into account


[09-Mar-19 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> first of all you're providing some http service (pool frontend) to the internet.


[09-Mar-19 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> in cryptospace.


[09-Mar-19 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> that WILL attract fuckwads


[09-Mar-19 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and they will try and do all sorts of funny stuff to your pool


[09-Mar-19 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> not even to the website part only, but who guarantees you the users of a pool all use 'legit' miners?


[09-Mar-19 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i mean, don't get me wrong, you cant just change 2 lines of code in the miner and be better than anybody else


[09-Mar-19 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but... theres a lot of different ways to piss you off


[09-Mar-19 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> interesting.. thats the world we live in ..


[09-Mar-19 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> btw mate.. is my understanding . correct for the immature theory


[09-Mar-19 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> >> i think i am starting to understand .. based on my understanding.. my  Immature: 0.05107928 .  will only go up when the next block is found and my shares counted .. right?
and once the 100 block passes for the respective blocks,  it will go into balance!


[09-Mar-19 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> any block after the block you're talking about is taking one off the 100


[09-Mar-19 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> i mean for my immature to go up


[09-Mar-19 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> now its 0.05107928


[09-Mar-19 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yes and most pools have a minimum balance before they release funds. Usually it will say on one of the setup pages on the pool


[09-Mar-19 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> so my immature balance will go up once the next block is found and i am credited right


[09-Mar-19 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> any found block you mined along on will give you more credit, yes


[09-Mar-19 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> cool


[09-Mar-19 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763

[09-Mar-19 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dudezmobi> gg hitbtc


[09-Mar-19 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Btw there is no fees using the verus miner right?


[09-Mar-19 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> correct only pool fees


[09-Mar-19 09:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @dudezmobi damn, messed up..


[09-Mar-19 10:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> @dudezmobi  Wow...thats crazy.  Definition of fail


[09-Mar-19 11:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dakgnosis> Very bad look for HitBTC. Hopefully they get held accountable for this behavior. As for the fork coin, just another scandal on their part.. they have somehow managed to outdo verge on the drama. Lol


[10-Mar-19 01:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> hello ! agama is basically a multiple in one wallet right?  and there is no fees to use it ?


[10-Mar-19 01:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> be aware of different versions of agama. but yes.


[10-Mar-19 01:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> agama can be a 'multicoin native wallet' as well as a "multicoin litemode wallet"


[10-Mar-19 01:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> as well as just your veruscoin wallet


[10-Mar-19 01:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> i downloaded from the verus site..  however i want to add ETH but i cant find it


[10-Mar-19 01:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i have jack of an idea wether that would be supported


[10-Mar-19 01:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i fear, rather not


[10-Mar-19 01:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> i read on komodo website there is ETH


[10-Mar-19 01:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> hm. did you try this one? üòê


[10-Mar-19 01:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> thats the part where it sucks to have multiple versions of it online


[10-Mar-19 01:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> oh


[10-Mar-19 01:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> the thing is:


[10-Mar-19 01:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> the komodo agama probably doesn't have the latest verus daemon inside


[10-Mar-19 01:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> agama belongs to komodo right?


[10-Mar-19 01:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> on the one machine i do use a gui at all, i have both installed, komodo and verus agama.


[10-Mar-19 01:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> well, "belongs to", yes kind of, it's one of their projects.


[10-Mar-19 01:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> can i upgrade the verus agama? lol


[10-Mar-19 01:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> your best bet is to install both i fear üòê


[10-Mar-19 01:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> or just lern how the commandline of the wallets work üòâ


[10-Mar-19 01:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> it will save you SO much trouble üòâ


[10-Mar-19 01:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> is there an official eth wallet?


[10-Mar-19 01:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> idk


[10-Mar-19 01:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> out of my knowledge territory


[10-Mar-19 01:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> i am ok to learn commandlines..


[10-Mar-19 01:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> i learn something new


[10-Mar-19 01:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> sending eth incur fees?


[10-Mar-19 01:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> how about sending verus?


[10-Mar-19 01:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> you should think about being more proactive in taking in knowledge.


[10-Mar-19 01:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> about every of your past questions can be answered with little to no time on google.


[10-Mar-19 01:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> sorry.. am searching on google too


[10-Mar-19 01:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and soon there will probably be a time when people feel you have asked enough you could've googled


[10-Mar-19 01:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and will stop responding


[10-Mar-19 01:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> just tot i will chat here


[10-Mar-19 01:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> ok .. apologies


[10-Mar-19 01:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> this is not a 'shut up' but a 'consider this!'


[10-Mar-19 01:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but watch out for a book called 'mastering bitcoin'


[10-Mar-19 01:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> may be a little early on in your learning process


[10-Mar-19 01:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> hng, these came out backwards.


[10-Mar-19 01:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> yea, that book is very useful and explains a lot of the underlying concepts, that are similar between blockchains (despite being labeled as a bitcoin book)


[10-Mar-19 01:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> theres a free version on github, if you download a pdf tho, you did probably pirate it, these aint legal.


[10-Mar-19 01:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> ok thank you . .


[10-Mar-19 01:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> will find the proper version on github


[10-Mar-19 01:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> the cool variant would actually be to buy it


[10-Mar-19 01:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> the author did an exemplary job and i think it should be rewarded


[10-Mar-19 01:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> you can buy PDFs, and these are legal.


[10-Mar-19 03:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dudezmobi> yeah


[10-Mar-19 06:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Didn‚Äôt some joker threaten to or actually release ‚Äúmastering bitcoin‚Äù after buying a copy?


[10-Mar-19 06:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Author made a power move and released it for free


[10-Mar-19 06:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> I‚Äôd pay the man


[10-Mar-19 06:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> hi community .. i need to reformat my mac.. i read the backup notes..  so basically i have to copy the wallet.dat to somewhere and restore it once i am done with reformat . .


[10-Mar-19 06:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> yes. you have some choices, copying away your wallet.dat to a safe place is probably one of the easier ones.


[10-Mar-19 06:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> obviosly double- and triplechecking everything while you copy it aside.


[10-Mar-19 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> am installing the ios test flight wallet


[10-Mar-19 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> see if i can migrate to that instead . .


[10-Mar-19 07:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i would recommend not mixing reinstall and experiments


[10-Mar-19 07:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> just do the one thing first


[10-Mar-19 07:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and then play with the other


[10-Mar-19 07:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> especially because the IOS wallet is under active development still


[10-Mar-19 07:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> that may end in desaster, even if the possibility for desaster isn't like 75%


[10-Mar-19 07:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but it's a bad idea still üòÑ


[10-Mar-19 07:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> ok mate. .   can i copy my private key and then reinstall? i dont mind downloading the block chain again . .   ( i tried to google and read but i cant find much on verus wallet besides the copy wallet.dat )


[10-Mar-19 07:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> copy off the wallet.dat


[10-Mar-19 07:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> it's a bit of pseudo security, because wether you loose your wallet.dat or your main private key isn't a huge difference unless your wallet.dat is encrypted


[10-Mar-19 07:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but you shouldn't store the plaintext keys


[10-Mar-19 07:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and to resync the blockchain use my bootstrap


[10-Mar-19 07:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> it will save you a LOT of time


[10-Mar-19 07:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i think it was `%%APPDATA%%/Komodo/VRSC` where you want to unpack this to: https://bootstrap.0x03.services/veruscoin/VRSC-bootstrap.tar.gz


[10-Mar-19 07:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> oh wait. osx


[10-Mar-19 07:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> `~/Library/Application\ Support/Komodo/VRSC` probably


[10-Mar-19 07:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> i cant even find my wallet.. this mac is killing me .. i think i will just abandon this wallet..


[10-Mar-19 07:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> mac is really really very restrictive in my opinion


[10-Mar-19 07:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> i spent a few days trying to mine and i still cant get it right -.-


[10-Mar-19 07:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Do you have your seeds or your WIF-keys of all addresses in your wallet? If so you can access those addresses from a new wallet!


[10-Mar-19 07:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> ok... my helper instinct kicks in


[10-Mar-19 07:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> if you trust me enough with it, i'll remote-desktop into your machine for 5min


[10-Mar-19 07:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> to show you where the stuff is


[10-Mar-19 07:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> also... doesn't osx have a search feature üòÑ


[10-Mar-19 07:32 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> try `cmd+space` and enter wallet.dat


[10-Mar-19 07:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> that should do the trick imo


[10-Mar-19 07:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> @0x03  i tried searching nothing came up.    even when i choose to see hidden files.    @Oink   i did not set any p/w nor phrases .. when i installed the wallet.. i went straight to sync and mine ..


[10-Mar-19 07:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> can you use a terminal, @SmeLLyArMpiTs


[10-Mar-19 07:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i'll offer something you should never do: i'll send you over commands to copypaste that will copy the wallet.dat onto your desktop.


[10-Mar-19 07:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Shall we move to #community-support ?


[10-Mar-19 07:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but i think peer 'trust' should be enough in here for me to give an impression that i'm not fucking anybody over


[10-Mar-19 07:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> @Oink not this time, we'd split a lenghty discussion in half


[10-Mar-19 07:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and this doesn't help the general 'searchability' of the info üòâ


[10-Mar-19 09:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> I have been thinking a lot about the UK FPGA miner. Some thought I have:


[10-Mar-19 09:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> 1. Is there any chance that someone else will make a clone? Like china and sell it for 100 bucks or something? Heard it was opensource on the software.


[10-Mar-19 09:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> 2. Will there be a version 2 in the nearest future and will this one be worthless in that case?


[10-Mar-19 09:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> 3. Is there a possibility that versus 2.0 makes their algorithm "FPGA incompatible" in future?


[10-Mar-19 09:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> 4. Are the community onboard with this FPGA miner? I mean do the think its ok?


[10-Mar-19 09:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> 5. Is there a "firmware" in the device that can be upgraded in future, if there are bug and so on?


[10-Mar-19 09:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> 6. I have a gpu mining rig. Can you dualmine, with say all the GPU:s and this one on the same motherboard, just as you can do with Cpu:s and gpus on the same board?


[10-Mar-19 09:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> 7. What about this "blackminer" everybody is talking about? is it better, worse, same? Can it mine verus 2.0


[10-Mar-19 09:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Any info or your thoughts on this will be appreciated! üëÜ


[10-Mar-19 09:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> oops maybe I should have wrote this in "mining" therad?


[10-Mar-19 09:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> i also mailed these (and more) questions directly to ukminer.io, but would like to know what all you guys think also!


[10-Mar-19 09:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gregorst> 7) Blackminer is a fpga miner, recently it started to support verus 2.0 but bitstream's development is not ended, so the performance are not the max the miner can do


[10-Mar-19 09:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> holy moly thats a lot of questions üòâ


[10-Mar-19 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> @0x03 üòÉ


[10-Mar-19 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> 1: always


[10-Mar-19 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> @gregorst ok


[10-Mar-19 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> 4: i am ok although i asked for any updates 3 times now, not getting any reply


[10-Mar-19 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> so thats 'for now'


[10-Mar-19 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gregorst> 5) Fpga miners use bitstream and yes, you can install newer , remove older etc


[10-Mar-19 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> 5: bitstream: yes. unsure if i go the whole picture


[10-Mar-19 09:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> 1. Worries me.


[10-Mar-19 09:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> well... anything can be copied


[10-Mar-19 09:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> it's more of a 'there is no way to stop such things' than a 'it will be copied 100%'


[10-Mar-19 09:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> just to put it into perspective a bit more


[10-Mar-19 09:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> pretty tough if you buy something for 399 and two months later you can buy a better clone for 99


[10-Mar-19 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @fng77 someone could make a clone but the base xil chip in the unit isn‚Äôt exactly cheap let alone the development and production of a batch of units.


[10-Mar-19 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> It wouldn‚Äôt be at that much of an undercut to UKMiner.


[10-Mar-19 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> yea. the question will be: will it pay to have a copy


[10-Mar-19 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> this will be deciding factor.


[10-Mar-19 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> @Ginasis Mining Pools Alright


[10-Mar-19 09:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> we should just all stfu and wait until mike has spoken


[10-Mar-19 09:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @SmeLLyArMpiTs please don‚Äôt abandon your wallet. You can either install the TestFlight mobile app onto your phone and send the coins there normally or @michaeltoutjr, @Asher , me, or someone should soon be able to tell you the wallet location on a Mac.


[10-Mar-19 09:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> 8. Who is the developer of the xil chip?


[10-Mar-19 09:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i tried explaining it to him üòâ


[10-Mar-19 09:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> 2. There could be a version 2 but to get better gains from a new unit it would require a better base FPGA chip (or more chips) this cost more.


[10-Mar-19 09:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gregorst> xilinx


[10-Mar-19 09:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Xilinx. They sell them as if they are CPUs.


[10-Mar-19 09:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Basically


[10-Mar-19 09:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> 5. There is basically firmware called bitstreams that can be updated any time to mine better or mine other crypto algorithms


[10-Mar-19 09:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Or do any other task that is made for the device for that matter


[10-Mar-19 09:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> ok @Ginasis Mining Pools


[10-Mar-19 09:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> like weather sim


[10-Mar-19 09:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i'm looking forward üòÑ


[10-Mar-19 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> 6. Yes you can have your GPUs mine 1 thing. Your cpu mine another and the FPGA mine something different.


[10-Mar-19 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> cool


[10-Mar-19 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i didnt answer 6 because we don't have the hw yet


[10-Mar-19 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Hell you can seperate your GPU rig and mine something different on each GPU.


[10-Mar-19 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> it shoul dbe a yes however


[10-Mar-19 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> @0x03 You thinking of getting one?


[10-Mar-19 09:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> I see no reason that the FPGA miner will stop / hinder mining anything else on GPUs.


[10-Mar-19 09:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> That would be a bad flaw in the program / miner of the FPGAs


[10-Mar-19 09:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> @fng77 i've preordered one


[10-Mar-19 09:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> !! Jealous !! Me that is


[10-Mar-19 09:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but don't take me as a decision helper on that


[10-Mar-19 09:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> When do you expect delivery?


[10-Mar-19 09:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i just asked over in the ukminer discord


[10-Mar-19 09:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> üòâ


[10-Mar-19 09:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> ok


[10-Mar-19 09:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> HOPEFULLY some time in march


[10-Mar-19 09:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> üëç


[10-Mar-19 09:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Nice!


[10-Mar-19 09:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> 8. The blackminer has multiple slightly lower model xil chips in it than the single one in the UKMiner. So once they update their bitstream it‚Äôs performance may increase but shouldn‚Äôt be anything crazy high.


[10-Mar-19 09:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> 7* ^


[10-Mar-19 09:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @ukminer17 and @Cuttlebit have taken an open approach. That means they are supporting the community effort to move to FPGAs without secret mining or the centralization that comes with it. We can expect clone boards at some point, and people will be able to use their open bitstream over time. Exactly when they publish their source with confirmation is still open. I believe that as long as they are confirmed, the community should support them as much as is reasonable, as the open approach they have decided on is somewhat unheard of in other projects. While we may and likely will tweak the algorithm in a future PBaaS update if more equalization is needed, we do not intend to move to an algo that blocks FPGAs at this time, and I don‚Äôt see a reason to do so.


[10-Mar-19 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Thanks for that info @miketout , That is a essential question I had.


[10-Mar-19 09:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i'd like to share this from over at the ukminer discord

[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Thanks


[10-Mar-19 09:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> To top it off: $399 is a competitive price for a 85Watt, 70MHs card. This will not hinder decentralization. I believe it will promote it...


[10-Mar-19 09:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> @0x03 can you invite me to ukminer discord? Dont rember if ukminer already did it but im still not in üòÉ @Oink Yeh, thats good number.


[10-Mar-19 09:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> did that work? see your DM


[10-Mar-19 09:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Worked, Splendid!


[10-Mar-19 09:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You could have followed the link on UKMINERS homepage... LOL


[10-Mar-19 09:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Ok, just lazy today

[10-Mar-19 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> Just popping in to answer any Q‚Äôs while I‚Äôm stopped off. Out and about at the moment but do have 5/10 mins before I‚Äôm driving again.

[10-Mar-19 10:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> A lot of questions I know. But 399 is a lot of money. But Im thinking about selling one of my pugs to get it. He is 12 years old anyway..


[10-Mar-19 10:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> Hahahaha.


[10-Mar-19 10:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> Dogs before mining please dude. üê∂


[10-Mar-19 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> @CryptoYeti Alright. üòÉ  If you look up a couple of lines I have asked 7 questions that are essential to me. These:


[10-Mar-19 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> 1. Is there any chance that someone else will make a clone? Like china and sell it for 100 bucks or something? Heard it was opensource on the software.
2. Will there be a version 2 in the nearest future and will this one be worthless in that case?
3. Is there a possibility that versus 2.0 makes their algorithm "FPGA incompatible" in future?
4. Are the community onboard with this FPGA miner? I mean do the think its ok?
5. Is there a "firmware" in the device that can be upgraded in future, if there are bug and so on?
6. I have a gpu mining rig. Can you dualmine, with say all the GPU:s and this one on the same motherboard, just as you can do with Cpu:s and gpus on the same board?
7. What about this "blackminer" everybody is talking about? is it better, worse, same? Can it mine verus 2.0


[10-Mar-19 10:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> fng77 if you actually sell a dog for mining, i'm never ever going to speak a single word with you again


[10-Mar-19 10:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> that is one of the worst things i've heard around this discord so far please do not even think about it!!!


[10-Mar-19 10:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> @CryptoYeti Some are already awnered but Id like your input when you got the time.


[10-Mar-19 10:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> Cloning is irrelevant unfortunately. Someone only needs to design a card using the same 420t chip and also with the power mods/requirements in order to do the same job. One unfortunate element to FPGA tech.


[10-Mar-19 10:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> @0x03 I hope you understand I was joking üòÉ I love them more then I love myself


[10-Mar-19 10:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> good to know. it wasn't obvious.


[10-Mar-19 10:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> UKMINER is only releasing 1 Verus mining option. The one for sale right now.


[10-Mar-19 10:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> to me üòâ


[10-Mar-19 10:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> @0x03 sorry


[10-Mar-19 10:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> It‚Äôs unlikely that Mike will make an algo change that totally eliminates FPGA. This is very hard to do. FPGA‚Äôs can be nerfed but generally not eliminated.


[10-Mar-19 10:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Right


[10-Mar-19 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> We have some great community support. But we are a new company so it‚Äôs very early days for us. We have various coders and other people join the team since we launched.


[10-Mar-19 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> No firmware as such. But we will be releasing bitstreams for other coins that will work on this card


[10-Mar-19 10:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Cool, sound very good!


[10-Mar-19 10:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> Blackminer is another company. We can‚Äôt comment on their business.


[10-Mar-19 10:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Ok, very happy with the answers Thanks @CryptoYeti


[10-Mar-19 10:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> @fng77 pleasure dude.


[10-Mar-19 10:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @fng77: one general remark. With the future rise of miners / FPGA‚Äôs / new CPU‚Äôs the network hashrate will inevitably rise, resulting in lower revenue for every device on the network. To me it‚Äôs common sense to keep that in mind, but I realize not everyone looks at it this way. It will translate into a longer ROI and in the end lower revenues, if that is the goal.


[10-Mar-19 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> yes


[10-Mar-19 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> If your goal is supporting the network, my above statement is obviously irrelevant


[10-Mar-19 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> we have limited sales to 2 batches to support the CPU side of Verus mining.


[10-Mar-19 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Which I appreciate, @CryptoYeti !!!


[10-Mar-19 10:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But there‚Äôs talk of Ryzen3 series and maybe the prospect of cloned FPGA‚Äôs. Just a general warning that nothing in our future is set.


[10-Mar-19 10:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> mm


[10-Mar-19 10:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> We're also putting some further thought into this matter and will comment once we have finished discussing internally.


[10-Mar-19 10:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoYeti> and yeah, this is crypto. The future changes daily üòÉ


[10-Mar-19 10:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> @Oink Cloning could be a big problem. @CryptoYeti Perfect!


[10-Mar-19 10:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Closing the source code is not a good idea... this is an open community... the code might be adapted for other devices... Cloning is not too worrying for me, because the Xilinx chips are still needed, so it won‚Äôt cut the price in half. They may be a little cheaper b using substandard parts, but will they perform as UKMiners device. Will they last as long? Cheaper device may turn into spending more money than it‚Äôs worth


[10-Mar-19 10:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Yes I know, that's why I deleted it üòÉ I¬¥m with you on that.


[10-Mar-19 10:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Sry, was writing. Didn‚Äôt notice it changed...


[10-Mar-19 10:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> no, no Nice of you to answer, I was thinking about it and the drawbacks. Like windows vs Linux üôÉ


[10-Mar-19 10:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Its very cool that you also can mine other crypto with the FPGA as well I think!


[10-Mar-19 10:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> But Im gonna stick to VRSC for a while, thats for sure.


[10-Mar-19 10:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> you better do üòâ


[10-Mar-19 10:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> üòÖ


[10-Mar-19 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I think it would be madness for UKMINER to not make use of the versatility of FPGA. Even if it‚Äôs just for marketing... I will stick to VRSC for sure, but then again, nothing in our future is fixed, except the fact that we all have to die....


[10-Mar-19 10:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <fng77> Thanks everybody for your input! Out with the dogs again. I have to carry the older one, he cant hadle the cold here. My left arm looks like this after this winter üí™


[10-Mar-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> ...doesnt `!vrsctip info` work in DM?!


[10-Mar-19 12:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> it used to


[10-Mar-19 12:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> doesn't it for you, as well?


[10-Mar-19 12:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> no longer working


[10-Mar-19 12:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> ok, then it's prolly a discord issue


[10-Mar-19 12:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> because it answers others in DM


[10-Mar-19 12:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> paia confirmed


[10-Mar-19 12:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> ok, gonna restart discord


[10-Mar-19 12:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> looks like the bot is broken


[10-Mar-19 12:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> oh, ok


[10-Mar-19 12:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> oh?


[10-Mar-19 12:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> @sclear


[10-Mar-19 12:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> wake up


[10-Mar-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @0x03 it doesn't answer me in DM. only when I'm DMing with the bot itself, and then it can't send to others


[10-Mar-19 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> @sclear needs to have a look i think


[10-Mar-19 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i have asked @sclear since we got the bot about fixing rain and soak, but I haven't gotten a reply. @FishyGuts / Pirate donated it to the community, and I believe they have asked as well.


[10-Mar-19 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> me neither, i did message him before


[10-Mar-19 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> in fact i'm waiting for a reply since exactly the day the bot joined us here


[10-Mar-19 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> me too üòÉ


[10-Mar-19 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> awesome üòê


[10-Mar-19 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> and I suspect @FishyGuts maybe as well


[10-Mar-19 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> kinda worried, he's a nice dude and it's unexpected for him to go missing like that


[10-Mar-19 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> no more sclear-like exits please üòÉ


[10-Mar-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> hopefully, he's fine. the bot seems to be working with basic tipping functions still


[10-Mar-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> !vrsctip thunder 24


[10-Mar-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <VRSC TipBot> :cloud_lightning: @elme has been thunderstruck with 24 VRSC!


[10-Mar-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> lucky dude, eh


[10-Mar-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> üòâ


[10-Mar-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> and thunder works


[10-Mar-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> üòÉ


[10-Mar-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> yea everything thats commonly used works in public


[10-Mar-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> it's just the DM part that went bonkers a day or so ago


[10-Mar-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i was able to talk to it in DM no 48hrs ago


[10-Mar-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> that still works for me when I am in DM with the bot, but I have never been able to access it from DM with someone else


[10-Mar-19 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> he'll probably get the @mentions. and i've just sent another message for good mesure.


[10-Mar-19 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> Yes I told him I need to get a RL contact for him with Peoples funds sitting in his bots. üòÉ 
@sclear


[10-Mar-19 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i have found back his mobile # and sent an sms


[10-Mar-19 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i'll let u know when i get a reply


[10-Mar-19 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> promised


[10-Mar-19 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> bot seems to have resumed work ... maybe it was out for dinner


[10-Mar-19 02:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <wistar> It works for me in DM, at least to make inquiries.


[10-Mar-19 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> yea, probably went on a short strike. works for me again as well


[11-Mar-19 01:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> ok, sclear is alive üòâ


[11-Mar-19 01:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> got a reply üòâ


[11-Mar-19 04:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> how can we make use of the fact that we've answered about any question about 10 times in the past in this discord? would anybody like to do a FAQ or something?


[11-Mar-19 04:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> the search function of discord isn't of much use and i understand 100% why people may not want to use it


[11-Mar-19 05:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Something like #faq-chosen #faq-draft #faq-edited , maybe? üò¨


[11-Mar-19 05:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> I get what you're saying. I'd wanna reach a point where we don't need to write to each other too. That'd be the dream! /s


[11-Mar-19 05:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Another back office boy.... LOL


[11-Mar-19 05:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But a faq or a how-to section would be a valuable addition!


[11-Mar-19 05:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> oh right we have faq channels *ducks, whistles and goes back into his corner*


[11-Mar-19 05:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but that still doesn't free us from the search feature üòÑ


[11-Mar-19 05:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> it may be overcomplicated, but why not just have a directory full of textfiles where we put in the more productive discussions like with Smellyarmpits before and some web tool to search it?


[11-Mar-19 05:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> just an idea tho


[11-Mar-19 05:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I didn‚Äôt say it had to be a discord section....

[11-Mar-19 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> Did anybody see or had suspicions about FPGA mining VRSC v2?


[11-Mar-19 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Thoskk Currently I believe the F1 has a bitstream, or an early version of one, for VerusHash 2.0. I think the price to hash is relatively similar to other components currently on or about to be on the network.


[11-Mar-19 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @Godballz  what I meant was: Is there any evidence that FPGAs already started to mine v2?


[11-Mar-19 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I think just the F1 community. I believe  @That_Guy8 did a trial too but I may be mistaken.


[11-Mar-19 05:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> saw it, thanks


[11-Mar-19 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Np. For the price, I'm interested in what ukminer can do


[11-Mar-19 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> though, if I'm not missing something, it might be hard to tell if a high hash from a single address is an FPGA or just a bunch of CPUs with same ID, right?


[11-Mar-19 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> I'd also be happy with one of those... however, I think for the local cost of electricity, and break even taking 450 days, I will sell some FOIN and buy me some VRSC for staking.


[11-Mar-19 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <wistar> @Godballz: Over in #mining, @ukminer17 is asking for some assistance in testing a pool.


[11-Mar-19 06:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @wistar I saw him asking for someone with a few hundered mh/s but I am definitely not that guy, I wish.. I could put maybe 10mh/s when I get home but that's alls I got. üôÑ

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> John Westbrook created and posted this api-
 Use with: <https://veruspay.io/api/> for simple USD VRSC price, or choose options now added!

Options (values are case insensitive): 
      currency - BTC or Fiat code like USD or CAD
      ticker - ARRR or VRSC
      data - volume or price - volume only relevant if exchange is defined
      exch - name of supported exchange, e.g. digitalprice - If no exchange, price is average of all supported for that coin.

If no options are set, the default is average price in USD fiat of VRSC.

Examples:

<https://veruspay.io/api/> - This get's the current price of VRSC in USD, weighted against 24hr volume across all exchanges. This is the default return.

<https://veruspay.io/api/?exch=digitalprice&currency=cad> - This will get the current price on digital price for VRSC and display in CAD fiat

<https://veruspay.io/api/?currency=btc> - This will get the average price of VRSC in BTC, weighted by 24 hr volume across both exchanges

<https://veruspay.io/api/?currency=cad> - This gets the current average price of VRSC in CAD, weighted by 24 hr volume across both exchanges

<https://veruspay.io/api/?exch=cryptobridge&data=volume> - This will get the 24 volume of VRSC on CryptoBridge in the default currency of USD

<https://veruspay.io/api/?exch=cryptobridge&data=volume&currency=btc> - This does the same but with BTC as the currency result

<https://veruspay.io/api/?currency=cad&ticker=arrr> - Gets the average price of ARRR, now added to the api! smiley

[11-Mar-19 09:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> i notice ARRR .. its just another coin right?  why is it so special to be in the api ?  want to understand


[11-Mar-19 09:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> It is another KMD related project


[11-Mar-19 09:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I believe the developers have worked together as well


[11-Mar-19 11:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> unlike other coins, pirate (which has the symbol of ARRR) *forces* you to do 'undercover transactions', @SmeLLyArMpiTs and thats the most important selling point of it, to me.

[12-Mar-19 03:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'm not sure what the best approach is or the rules but I feel like when people see that more than once, that's the general impression they'd get too. Similar to many of the less welcome DMs but if you're giving something away, that seems like a nice gesture at least. I haven't seen ya around so the sudden burst set off alarms, ya know?


[12-Mar-19 03:16 AM] Gateway#3763

[12-Mar-19 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> don't bother reacting

[dscrdvrsc] <dude> how many tps/ctps are possible at the current state with VRSC ?


[12-Mar-19 04:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i'd say equivalent to the benchmark komodo did a year(?) back


[12-Mar-19 04:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> 1 million tps?


[12-Mar-19 04:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> if this was the number, i'd think it would be possible, yes


[12-Mar-19 04:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> may need more nodes for the network, but thats obviously probably a limiting factor


[12-Mar-19 04:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> is it possible to read vrsc as MQTT ?


[12-Mar-19 04:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> -> @miketout should be able to answer that, i cannot (but i'm certainly interested in the answer as well)


[12-Mar-19 04:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> the official vrsc explorer is saying there is a current supply of 38544018.02537829 coins. how is that float value possible **0.02537829** ?

[dscrdvrsc] <John Westbrook> @Crabby Paddy this is definitely not the place to promote or advertise, as the name of the channel implies, it's a place for general discussion related to Verus.  I would classify it as spam.

It is similar to using a web hosting service to build a website with, but rather than having to build one by yourself from scratch, the service provider supplies the basics and handles all the necessary tasks from general upkeep to infrastructure maintenance. Since Verus doesn't rely on a centralized authority to work, there isn't any one single point of failure in the network, so in the event of a hack, power failure, data breach or loss, Verus' system is immune while the other options aren't. Instead of relying on a centralized system, Verus elegantly does work for the public by utilizing the public to do work.

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Just trying to find relevant info to help get psyched up!


[12-Mar-19 10:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> if that explanation would've been written by juniper, it probably said 'runs on the fabric of the internet'

[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and please continue posting such info @Godballz i appreciate it


[12-Mar-19 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> @Crabby Paddy see your DM please. it contains an excuse for being too rude before, which wasnt fair from me. but your spamming wasn't approved of either üòâ


[12-Mar-19 10:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> for some perspective, the behaviour you've exposed would resemble the one of a scammer to quite a remarkable degree. even if legit, it may lower peoples alarmedness about similar, probably malicious offers in the future, and we cannot have that happen in here.


[12-Mar-19 10:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> me personally i'm fighting rather hard to have everything we do here verifiable and transparent and safe as much as possible. i'm not a fan at all of something that will interfere with that.

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I know of only one staking pool, and you are already on it.


[13-Mar-19 02:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> can someone answer my 2 questions above?


[13-Mar-19 02:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Sorry, I can answer, but it would be nonsense... a more knowledgeable person should answer that...


[13-Mar-19 09:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @dude I see three questions. First, transactions per second now are limited to a single blockchain, and I believe currently would max out at under 300 tps for a single blockchain. The design of PBaaS effectively eliminates this speed barrier by scaling up to a virtually unlimited number of chains. For example, only 1000 chains makes that a 300k limit across the system.we are not concerned as much about marketing specific numbers right now as we are about making the entire system scale. At some point, the goal would be thousands of blockchains operating across the Verus ecosystem. I don‚Äôt understand your question about MQTT, but there is no interface to MQTT at this time. It would not be hard. As far as the decimal. One Satoshi is 1/100000000 of a coin and amounts are stored in Satoshis, so you can have 8 decimal places.


[13-Mar-19 09:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> ok thanks for answering that, you are right three questions üòÑ but I dont really understand the last answer or I may have not really clearified why this value is strange for me. When there were rewards for the miners/stakers in the past like 48, 96, 192, 384 VRSC/Block how can this floating value exist in the current supply from the example above (0.02537829)? The current circulating supply should be dividable by 6 or like current_supply % 6 = 0 how can these decimal places be NOT null in the explorer, when the rewards were 384, 192, 96, 48, 24 until now in  the past ?


[13-Mar-19 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> eg 38585034.13030189 is current circulating supply. 38585034 is dividable by 6 but what is with that decimal places? how can they ever exist in total circulating supply? .13030189 should be .00000000


[13-Mar-19 10:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> ``Era 1: Block 0 - 10080 reward: 0 to 384, rising linearly and changing each block``
<https://veruscoin.io/downloads/papers/VerusVision.pdf>, page 21.
The first 10080 blocks were "decimal rewards" up to 384.


[13-Mar-19 10:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @zpajk is exactly correct. many decimal rewards were issued in the early days.

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @FishyGuts as per the Vision paper, the ID system is in phase III, after PBaaS, which is in phase II. the ID system is definitely not a focus right now and when it is, it will be built using PBaaS. The system will be quite complete for many uses well before that, and I fully expect people to use existing ID systems along with PBaaS as well

[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> There was a pop-up for the stock Windows firewall to open up for the daemon - and it got hidden for a while under another window before I saw it.  Maybe that lag created some issue or created something happening out of the normal sequence...  working now.

[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> We just got kicked out of CPU-minable coins to FPGA-minable coins on CPU Miner's Discord.


[15-Mar-19 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> *slow clap*


[15-Mar-19 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> ah. they judge by "there is a miner client for gpu" mislabeling that as "gpu coin"...


[15-Mar-19 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> yes, by that logic verus is now an fpga coin. they missed kicking us out as being a GPU coin before however

[15-Mar-19 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Thoskk did you tell them how ridiculous that is right now?


[15-Mar-19 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i guess just a disservice to their members


[15-Mar-19 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> still trying @miketout  ... but I don't think it will be understood.


[15-Mar-19 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> you can show that yes, we do have FPGAs on the network, and based on price performance of what is currently available, they perform competitively with the best CPUs right now, meaning CPUs are still competitive.


[15-Mar-19 02:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> seem's they're quite puristic about what they call a "CPU minable" coin ... and the're judging the whole project from a few numbers. I can't see how this will work out. And I'm not sufficiently motivated to argue with a "religious" miner.


[15-Mar-19 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> I second that, @Thoskk. Hard to measure but I don‚Äôt see our presence there making a difference either. Yet, sticking us under primarily fpga is just ignorant, no offense intended.


[15-Mar-19 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> I'm with you, and I also think it's at least not totally openminded for possibilities @zpajk  . However - discussion will not change anything in their minds, so ... I rather spend my time with more important things üòâ

[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> let's wait until the panic settles.


[15-Mar-19 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> well. we tried talking to them.


[15-Mar-19 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> now we're talking about german tax laws

[15-Mar-19 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i think it can be summed up to "whenever there is something thats slightly more efficient than a cpu, or at least offering remarkably more hashrate than  a cpu it is not cpu favourable anymore"


[15-Mar-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> finding yescryptR16 coins labeled as GPU coins speaks a similar language.


[15-Mar-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> well... as said before, there wasn't much traffic in that channel neither, so I don't think we lost a lot.


[15-Mar-19 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Thoskk yeah I agree. In our brief time there and my occasional visits, I've found being added there to be minimally beneficial both to us and for their own members. The layout doesn't help anyone to find anything new out anyhow.
Apparently they have a very specific definition for what a CPU mineable project is now, one that they're seemingly ok with misrepresenting to their own members that look to them for guidance and one that also technically happens to not fit the standard English definition for the suffix "able" by any account..
I'm making a mental note to make it a point to revisit this cpuminersclub in a bit to see just when it is that they finally see the light and decide to come back around. Matter of time.. ‚åõ


[15-Mar-19 08:03 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> @zpajk I came from CPU Miners club fwiw


[15-Mar-19 11:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> in fairness this is the natural way of things. I've seen many good projects get rotated out because they simply aren't in line with profitability from other coins


[15-Mar-19 11:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> They might be jumping the gun a bit (I haven't pulled my miners, or anything), but the FPGA netshare is almost certainly just going to grow


[15-Mar-19 11:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> If I do the cold profit calculation, at this moment yes, I am better off mining PascalCoin


[16-Mar-19 12:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> Here are my calculations. 1. 200mh approximately 30 coins a day 2. 0.00002000 vrsc/btc. and btc $3950. 3. 30 x 0.00002000 x $3950  =$2.37 minus electricity, thus $865 minus electricity. F1 miner is 2k. I don't no why anyone would buy an f1 miner to get close to 30%-40% ROI. I don't expect blackminer F1 FPGAs to stay on network for long but we can wait and see.

[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> Anyone know why I seem to only get 5 to 6 connections when I have p2port 27485 open, maxconnections=40, server=1, listen=1,listenonion=1 in the config file?


[17-Mar-19 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @bishop have you gotten more before from that? 5 is what I always get too but I never changed those values either


[17-Mar-19 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> 5 is what you cap at unless you run a full node (like the explorers or pool servers run). Just stumped why I'm not maxing out on connections


[17-Mar-19 07:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @bishop it was dropped to 4 some months ago to reduce connectivity pressure across the whole network. at 4, open connections were often not picking up much traffic in the way of incoming. We raised it to 5 to strengthen the general connectivity and raise average connection count a bit, rather than jump to 6. Raising it to 5 did create more connectivity on some nodes that we were watching, but raising it to 6 might still strengthen things further if the network can easily handle it. Network connectivity overall seems pretty healthy, but if it can absorb a little more connectivity at 6 outgoing, because there's extra capacity on open nodes, then it won't hurt. thanks for the info.


[17-Mar-19 07:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <lootz> verus is one of the few PoS coins I like and participate in, how many of you would like to see a stake pool to get more returns for staking ? I had an interview with Polyshield and can get us added... possibly not sure about the technical difficulty with sk-snarks adding


[17-Mar-19 08:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GeekOPS-101> yeah I dont have a masternode yet, id throw my stack of coins in with Verus people for sure


[17-Mar-19 08:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> @miketout How are the pools and explorers getting more than 5 or so connections? What am I missing?  I figured the config file and port forwarding on my end was enough to connect to more than five.


[17-Mar-19 09:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> there is nothing special they are doing that I know of. As long as the ports are open, it should be able to get more connections, and with the explorer at 160, I would think there may be another issue on incoming. Are you sure you have IPv6 support? Maybe @0x03 would have an idea.

[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> @bishop  DM me, lets talk about your setup.


[18-Mar-19 02:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Hi all.  Is it true that modern processors usually do more with less energy? Am considering the viability of using my old rigs. I revive an AMD triple core and despite plugging out hdd 2 and dvd rom , it burns 120watt at rest -.-


[18-Mar-19 02:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> I even took out the dedicated sound card


[18-Mar-19 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Are you referring to modern cpus being more power efficient in general or verushash specifically as it uses modern instructions which renders older cpus less viable for mining?


[18-Mar-19 02:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> @zpajk i guess for wallet staking and mining ..     figured i use an old rig to be a 24/7   however the power seems too high ..  even my i5 intel 4 cores useless less than that amd


[18-Mar-19 02:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Staking doesn't require much at all, but mining does. For mining the cpu should support AVX, AES-NI and PCLMUL, else the hashrate will suffer greatly. Older AMDs are power hungry in general.


[18-Mar-19 02:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> yeah .. my another rig is a pentium R 2ghz    i think its pointless for that too


[18-Mar-19 04:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> if power prices arent your limiting factor, theres some other altcoins you can mine with these.


[18-Mar-19 04:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> they're not useless, but it's not going to be the profitabilitybomb either


[18-Mar-19 07:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> There are generally huge differences between old and new hardware in terms of compute per watt, yes


[18-Mar-19 07:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> Power consumption has trended mostly flat (exception is memory), but obviously total theoretical compute has gone up dramatically


[18-Mar-19 07:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> if we're comparing a chip from 2008 to 2018 for example, the newer chip is likely more than 10x as efficient when running flat-out


[18-Mar-19 07:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> But for mining basically any currency, there are considerations besides pure compute output, like vector extensions, hardware crypto acceleration, etc


[18-Mar-19 07:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> those are much more important than generational CPU improvement


[18-Mar-19 07:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> If you're determined to do your own staking, I would suggest getting a used server off eBay. They are cheap, efficient and extremely reliable. Plus it's cool

[19-Mar-19 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> I'm pretty sure I have some of the most efficient CPU hardware and it's 54 MH/s at 300 watts


[19-Mar-19 12:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> 90 MH/s at 65 watts sounds like the claimed UKMiner performance, i.e. also an FPGA


[19-Mar-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> which cpu are you mining on Vycid


[19-Mar-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> ryzen monsters?


[19-Mar-19 01:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> AFAIK Ryzen threadripper 2950WX is 250Watts


[19-Mar-19 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I think he is running xeon phi's


[19-Mar-19 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Believe it or not


[19-Mar-19 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Phi has been a curiosity of mine since the beginning. I think it's super cool he is rocking those bad boys

[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> too lazy to google myself and thought i'd spark some talk about it :>


[19-Mar-19 02:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Not 100% but like intel made super CPUs that are sorta like GPU/CPU hybrid. Sorta..

[19-Mar-19 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'm gonna move them


[19-Mar-19 03:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> so actually no, they're not cards


[19-Mar-19 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> they're socketed CPUs, although yes the cards do exist and I have a couple dozen gathering dust


[19-Mar-19 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> 'standard' amd64 type cpus?


[19-Mar-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> About 80% of my hardware is actually ATX boards with radiators/water cooling. The other 20% is server blades


[19-Mar-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> or with bells and whistles?


[19-Mar-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> Yep. I run rancherOS on them


[19-Mar-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i guess the 'yep' matches the first of my 2 questions üòâ


[19-Mar-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> yeah, amd64 üòâ


[19-Mar-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> how much is one of these?


[19-Mar-19 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> but one major whistle: 16 gig of HBM2 on package


[19-Mar-19 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and much more important, how much hashrate can you rip out of them


[19-Mar-19 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> like literally under the CPU IHS


[19-Mar-19 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> faster than the "modern" architectures without north/southbridge?


[19-Mar-19 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> heh, price depends on who you know and how much you buy


[19-Mar-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> because these usually have their mem channeled right into the cpu as well


[19-Mar-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> oh wow


[19-Mar-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> ridiculously faster


[19-Mar-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> yeah around 500 GB/sec bandwidth


[19-Mar-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> basically a GPU with CPU architecture


[19-Mar-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> aha, more speed by wider bus, so google tells me


[19-Mar-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> hashrate depends a ton on what algorithm and how well the miner is optimized for phi


[19-Mar-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> yep


[19-Mar-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> It's pretty neat, I run the DDR4 slots totally empty


[19-Mar-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> heh. does the phi mem show up in the POST/uefi/whatnot?


[19-Mar-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> or does it boot with 0gb? üòÑ


[19-Mar-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> because that probably looks ridiculous


[19-Mar-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> huh that's a good question I don't remember


[19-Mar-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> I think it does


[19-Mar-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> The BIOS has several memory modes and I generally run it in the mode where it doesn't differentiate HBM2 from DDR4


[19-Mar-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> def. sounds like a toy for me


[19-Mar-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Like running on only cache


[19-Mar-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> it's like having libvirt style powers


[19-Mar-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but with real hw


[19-Mar-19 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> 'here, let me reboot quickly and shove in another cpu core'


[19-Mar-19 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and that sounds like hell of a thing üòÑ


[19-Mar-19 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Nice to toy with....


[19-Mar-19 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> @Vycid did you try kvm/libvirt/something alike (besides docker) on these?


[19-Mar-19 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> .... can they have direct storage? per card?


[19-Mar-19 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> no idea about the cards... probably not.


[19-Mar-19 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> the host cpus, definitely


[19-Mar-19 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> if people want the coprocessor cards I could definitely sell some of those, I'm not even using them


[19-Mar-19 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> I have some GPU servers I could part with as well I suppose


[19-Mar-19 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> you're probably from the other end of the world, seen from my place


[19-Mar-19 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> lemme just guess: not around EU


[19-Mar-19 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> nope.....


[19-Mar-19 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> but the coprocessors aren't too bad to ship


[19-Mar-19 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> the servers no way üòÖ


[19-Mar-19 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> I need to have a yard sale... extra Phi CPUs, coprocessors, GPU servers, even some oddball Phi pedestal systems I could sell

[20-Mar-19 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <dude> I am concerned about top #1 wallet. its slightly increasing its % share and ~5% with staking is not a whale its like a black hole


[20-Mar-19 05:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> it could be a case of `-pubkey`


[20-Mar-19 05:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> just sayin'


[20-Mar-19 06:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> ? Don‚Äôt get it


[20-Mar-19 06:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> you said the balance is increasing more than it could by only staking alone, if i got you right.


[20-Mar-19 06:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> well, one can redirect rewards using `-pubkey=<somevalue>` to another place


[20-Mar-19 06:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> it could as well be the collecting address for more than just one operation


[20-Mar-19 06:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> thats what i'm saying


[20-Mar-19 06:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> yeah but it‚Äôs still one wallet where the % share is slightly increasing


[20-Mar-19 06:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> anyone knows which wallet is DP ?


[20-Mar-19 06:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gt> i believe it may be the wallet for the funds komodo collects


[20-Mar-19 06:09 AM] Gateway#3763

[21-Mar-19 10:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Curious to see what it translates into... higher price because of harder competition or lower price because big players have reduced their costs to sell lower while still profitable.


[21-Mar-19 10:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I think the second, which is actually beneficial to me, since I‚Äôm exchanging my non-Verus mining rewards into VRSC, to have it stake.


[21-Mar-19 10:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Difficulty jumps all over the place at the moment. Saw yesterday network hashrate below 135 GH/s...


[21-Mar-19 10:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> If VRSC drops 5%, all big miner seem to switch away.


[21-Mar-19 11:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Would be strange to see price drop too much, because it's already pretty attractive to buy an amount to stake vs mining. Or keep rewards to stake instead of selling at low price. Of course there's always big stakers who can sell at pretty much whatever price, even if it might be detrimental to their remaining balance.


[21-Mar-19 11:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I don‚Äôt expect it to drop much, I think the bottom will be around 2000-2050 satoshi. You really need to drop more than 1BTC worth of Verus to get it lower.... if that happens, I‚Äôll transfer my BTC to drive the price up... unfortunately I don‚Äôt have too deep pockets, so won‚Äôt be more than .25BTC


[21-Mar-19 11:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Staking power % remains the same regardless of the network hash, so if price drops it only makes more sense to buy to stake instead of mining equipment.


[21-Mar-19 11:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Indeed, it does... HODL, HODL, HODL....


[21-Mar-19 11:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Only depends on total amount of VRSC staking....

[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> well damn.  Time to reload.  

At any rate, I wanted to give you guys this Article highlighting Veruspay and the bounty we are putting on in conjunction.


[22-Mar-19 05:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> If you all could post this with Veruscoin takes, z commerce tags and let people know about the bounty, we would be appreciative.   
The first version I wrote felt too "Piratey" SO I wanted to "Verus it up a little.

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Great article  @FishyGuts, I posted it on reddit a couple of places too. - <https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoMarkets/comments/b4dgn9/vrsc_arrr_private_free_and_selfsovereign_payment/> and <https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/b4cvnb/vrsc_arrr_private_free_and_selfsovereign_payment/> .

[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Question: are my minted coins from staking automatically added to my staking weight/total after they mature? Or do I have to unshield them? I get confused...


[23-Mar-19 05:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> @jintaa Shield to private address, then send back to public address to have them staking.


[23-Mar-19 08:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <runningwithbeer> What? @0x03


[23-Mar-19 08:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> @Cragorn ok, thanks.


[23-Mar-19 09:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> @zpajk when miners sell and dump the price it‚Äôs easy for top stakers to increase their stake, they just buy at lowest price. When they increase the stake they have a higher chance to get a block reward. In the end are miners dumping the price for the stakerholders. 

At some point there will be a turn. It‚Äôs harder for miners to sell for a lower price because the cost are increasing. So the price is increasing. Imho staking is the best option.

[dscrdvrsc] <anrahu akeba> Does veruscoin have financial attributes?what is it?what are our applications in finance?


[23-Mar-19 11:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Well right now Verus is already one of the most secure and decentralized stores of value thanks to its many technical and security features, but since one of Verus' primary goals is a PBaaS network made of multiple cohesive projects all working hand in hand to build security and add value for miners and staker, I believe ultimately it will become an entirely self sufficient full blown economy in it's own right with merged mining and PBaaS creating a positive feedback loop, reinforcing and building upon itself in perpetual growth.
If you haven't read about PBaaS and merged mining yet, the search function should provide you with more insight.  It reallly is revolutionary stuff that the Verus devs are toiling away at and I for one am extremely excited for the future!  @anrahu akeba


[24-Mar-19 12:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @anrahu akeba This is a brief description actually- <https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoTechnology/comments/b4la6x/merged_mining_and_pbaas_for_verus_two_peas_in_a/>


[24-Mar-19 12:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <anrahu akeba> Thank you for reply,yes,I have already read about PBaaS, I translated Mike‚Äôs statement of it to Chinese.I mean for now,whether ICO or IEO,they all give people outside the circle a message:‚Äùcome and make money‚ÄùSo I wish one day PBaaS have this ability,I think we can.@Godballz


[24-Mar-19 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Hopefully it will indeed have that effect- Inspire other devs to build here and grow on PBaaS, and for other miners to join in merge mining their many projects!


[24-Mar-19 12:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I believe when that time comes, it will leave little other alternatives for miners and project creators as it is difficult enough as it is to make a profit right now. Verus should offer relief and a new hope for a better and more efficient system that was built from the ground up, designed to support and reinforce itself and its users.


[26-Mar-19 05:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Verus is up 8% today on multiple exchanges, and trade volume is also up  (guesstimate) 5x of the usual daily volume - any good news that I've missed today? Cheers üòÉ

[26-Mar-19 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Chazmainian Devil> Actually try Teamviewer "for Personal use"... Set up quick access by making an account and then install on every rig you want to monitor. It will send confirmation e-mail to you and then you can monitor from anywhere. It also has task monitor features as well. Works for me!

[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> ssh is also free


[28-Mar-19 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Vycid> And with it you can control multiple systems at the same time... if you've got more than a couple, using teamviewer to remote into each becomes tedious


[28-Mar-19 10:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> Thanks. I was actually hoping for a dashboard style solution for the cpu usage / temps etc. So far no luck üò¶

[dscrdvrsc] <thedawson13> Hey guys I stumbled upon this project due to a low key shill on Twitter. I'm wondering how veruspay works exactly when veruscoin has such low liquidity? Or is veruspay just a gateway by which you can use other currencies? I'm confused


[29-Mar-19 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @thedawson13 Veruspay is a brand new plug-in, which is developing continuously. Veruspay currently supports Veruscoin and Pirates payments, but the development continues. The plug-in connects to the coins chain using it‚Äôs own wallets and is therefore independent, just like any full wallet on the coins network.
The liquidity you are referring to is due to the fact that this project was launched without an Initial Coin Offering or pre-mining.
I hope this answers your questions, but if you want to know more, don‚Äôt hesitate.

[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> personally I like the design.


[29-Mar-19 05:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> The Latin is based off the verus website


[29-Mar-19 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Also,  googling it produces the same result


[29-Mar-19 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> ok ... never seen that...


[29-Mar-19 05:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> @draeth, very cool designs. I wonder if the motto "virtue cannot be bought" is a little...sentimental? Or wd that be moralizing? Either way, something more objective wd be more of my direction. Like "truth Can't be bought." A little more on topic also, since verus means truth...but either way- great work! üòÄ


[29-Mar-19 05:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Oh, if it's from the website, then of course it's perfect! Lol...it comes from the project creators, so no real argument there...


[29-Mar-19 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> if I may jump in: verus means "true", not "truth"


[29-Mar-19 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> and I'm missing the "non" in the Latin


[29-Mar-19 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Ok, truth is still closely related enough to true to make it relevant, imo

[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> because, if it's not a special term, I can't find sense in it üòâ


[29-Mar-19 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> @miketout what do you think of the design?


[29-Mar-19 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Ah


[29-Mar-19 05:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Well, it's the slogan used by the creators of verus

[29-Mar-19 05:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> hm, need to do some research, however, I would rather translate it "true virtue can be bought" ... roughly


[29-Mar-19 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> in any case I can't see a "not" in there üòâ


[29-Mar-19 05:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> and "bought" might not even catch it


[29-Mar-19 05:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I like it. The current slogan is "truth and privacy for all". what do you think about putting that on the back?


[29-Mar-19 05:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> like truth and privacy on the top and for all on the bottom, or something


[29-Mar-19 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> @miketout the funny thing is, I had that originally, but changed it to what it looks like  now


[29-Mar-19 05:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Sorry, not to take us off topic, but if we dont start getting some more liquidity soon, is there a chance us early adopters cld inadvertently be grandfathered into an effective oligarchy that cld harm the coin's prospect of widespread adoption down the line? We're still scheduled to be getting 24 verus rewards per block for another 1.5 years, roughly, right?


[29-Mar-19 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @jintaa not sure of the question. the block rewards are that, but we are making good progress on PBaaS, so additional rewards will be possible soon, both of other chains and notarization rewards to secure PBaaS chains


[29-Mar-19 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> The question is: if more ppl aren't introduced to the community sooner than later, a smaller number of early adopters might end up with a disproportionately large share of total circulating verus. I referenced 24 verus to say in the long run, that actually will seem like a large number, say in 10 yrs, with pbaas up and running, adoption picking up, etc...is the question valid in your opinion, @miketout miketout?

[29-Mar-19 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> I'm effectively saying- much as I'd like to hoard as much verus early on, and continue to accumulate in these early days, a more objective side of me sees the harm in not getting more ppl involved in ownership/furthering distribution...


[29-Mar-19 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @jintaa two things... first, PBaaS is actually going to drive redistribution, as it will be used for creating other chains and cause existing Verus to get recycled to miners and stakers through use of PBaaS. that will hopefully make 24 coins a smaller and smaller part of why people mine through a sustainable economy. second, i need to run to eat dinner, but I can come back to discuss more a bit later.

[29-Mar-19 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> @miketout could you give a quick response on why you feel so strongly about pbaas? I am curious what in your mind differentiates it from something like Ardor?


[29-Mar-19 10:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Interesting question. They're really not the same thing. though there could be some overlap in larger projects. In fact, each of the PBaaS chains are not exactly children, and are actually started with transactions that make offers to the entire Verus community of miners and Verus owners to participate in, mine, and support their projects and applications through a scalable, decentralized cross-chain protocol. This will enable even transiently created and abandoned blockchains to operate on behalf of applications, or long term projects to start up with easy configuration and a scalable future, without requiring any immediate development or alternate infrastructure provisioning on the part of the person, organization, or application creating the blockchain for its use. PBaaS chains could even be fairly launched, expected to stay coupled to Verus or another Verus chain as part of a project or application, or even launched and separated at a later date. They can also have pre-mines, funding/conversion periods, and will be able to earn their own native rewards, Verus, or a combination of the two. All chains will be automatically merge-mineable, have support for 51% hash attack protection, cross chain transactions, and all basic features of Verus, as well as the ability to develop smart transactions to support applications.


[29-Mar-19 10:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Also, I should mention. The PBaaS upgrade will include a unique (to my knowledge) PoS proof in the header itself that enables a header to be much more trusted than on other PoS enabled chains, and is part of what makes the automated cross-chain system more secure as well. As far as I know, there is not another PoS system with such a header proof of the stake that won the block.


[29-Mar-19 10:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Is there any impact to staking with merge mining? Or is it strictly mining related


[29-Mar-19 11:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> merge mining of other chains can earn rewards from the other chains. staking on other chains can earn rewards on the other chains. mining and staking on either the other chains or Verus can earn cross chain notarization rewards.


[29-Mar-19 11:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> and of course, some chains will have systems that enable transactions intended to capture value or information and exchange value


[29-Mar-19 11:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I also expect some PBaaS chains to provide opportunity to participate in the chain by using Verus, which would enable Verus holders to earn by staking.

[dscrdvrsc] <apjh> Hi dear community and developers. I have one suggestion with the tipbot and staking.

I am also a member of another community where I see they run a similar tipbot that we have here. I also just see that the tipbot they use has a staking feature that I would like to have we had the opportunity here too.

I have now mined verus the last 3 months and have mined about 150 coins at that period, which I am very happy with as I only mine on a single pc that mostly only mining for 10 hours a day.

I have staked my coins ever since the start but have not yet received any staking reward, this may be because the pc must have a restart once in a while and i have so few coins still.

Such a function in the tipbot could result in smaller miners such myself being able to place coins in a staking pool to get faster reward.

I thought this might have been a good idea for this community as well?
sorry if i post this in wrong channel, i was trying to find a suitable place to post this.

HI guys, what algorithm is Versus I would like to get my hands on some, and wondered if it might be profitable to mine with GPU ?


[30-Mar-19 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> VerusHash 2.0. Its their own algo designed to better balance hashrate across hardware types. CPUs tend to do the best and now FPGAs are doing well too. GPUs appear to be less efficient at the algo at this time but some are running both CPU and GPU together to get a decent hash

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Matterbridge


[30-Mar-19 08:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Plus you can check out the CPU hashrate and GPU hashrate channel to get an idea of what other people are getting


[30-Mar-19 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dakgnosis> @miketout Regarding the ability for any Verus autochain to develop smart contracts, will we be able to interact with them using z addresses? I could see huge benefits in providing anonymity with a smart contract, especially for businesses that may not want to reveal their finances.


[30-Mar-19 09:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @dakgnosis smart transactions can interact with z-transactions, but it's a matter of being able to spend from and to smart transactions from z-transactions, which can be done.


[30-Mar-19 09:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> for example, the stake guard smart transaction allows anyone who can prove double staking to spend the output to a z-address already. the proof of double staking is there, but no-one can see where the spend went

[dscrdvrsc] <c2k> im getting a popup that i need to shield VRSC before sending. when i go to my receiving addresses i see a "zc..." address and a "zs..." address. 
does it matter which one i use to shield?


[31-Mar-19 06:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> zs (sapling) should be less resource consuming (faster) if I've understood correctly.
But both work for the purpose of shielding.


[31-Mar-19 06:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <c2k> ok thanks


[31-Mar-19 06:43 AM] Gateway#3763

[31-Mar-19 06:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Create a zs address or use one from earlier in Receive tab. Copy the address. Go to Send tab and choose 'Shield all recent coinbase transactions'. Paste the copied address in the 'Send to' field, then press 'Shield funds' button, and confirm.


[31-Mar-19 06:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <c2k> gotcha. thanksüëä


[31-Mar-19 06:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Once you gotten at least 1 block confirmation of that transaction you can send it back to a transparent address for staking or whatever. But the important part is that you have to wait for at least 1 confirmation to continue transferring those funds.


[31-Mar-19 06:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> btw, 0.5.5 had some staking issues, where it would stop staking when transferring funds to private addresses. You might want to upgrade, depending on your needs. 0.5.6 has been available for a long time. I'd recommend upgrading, but I can't stress enough about the importance of backing up your wallet on a regular basis, at least before upgrading Agama.


[31-Mar-19 07:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <c2k> appreciate the help


[31-Mar-19 07:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <c2k> i downloaded v0.5.6-beta but it has been "rescanning blocks" for about 15minutes already. is that normal?


[31-Mar-19 07:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> It can be, especially if you haven't used the wallet for a while and it needs to catch up.


[31-Mar-19 08:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Hmm... 0.5.6 was also the version where they moved a few folder targets... if the transactions list is empty and states something about "An error has occured" while it's rescanning, it might help to restart. I think that was a bug as well.


[31-Mar-19 08:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I thought it was an earlier version that moved the files, but restarting the application doesn‚Äôt hurt...

[dscrdvrsc] <SmeLLyArMpiTs> @zpajk  if I may ask .. is there any commands or means to confirm that I am staking it right? I just feel very vulnerable seeing staking = true but nothing coming in  haha


[31-Mar-19 10:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> @SmeLLyArMpiTs I know the feeling. I've expressed my trust issues for the staking earlier, but every Agama version so far has indicated that "Staking: true" is accurate.
Another option is to look at ``%appdata%\Komodo\VRSC\debug.log`` and scroll to the bottom. The timestamp might be off due to GMT differences, but look at the "height=" parameter stated and the regular phrase ``Searched for eligible staking transactions, no winners found``.

[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Using cli command ``listunspent`` you should be able to see all the transactions you're staking.


[31-Mar-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> The cli command `getmininginfo` will show you your staking status...
(I feel a guide coming on CLI commands and how to apply them when you installed the GUI wallet...)

[31-Mar-19 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Thanks @Godballz @Hollowman9000 and really everyone for making this such a community effort. I really appreciate knowing that the community is supporting each other and working on software and ideas to improve things as well. This will be the biggest upgrade yet, and I can't wait to startup our first PBaaS chains üòÉ At the same time, @michaeltoutjr has also made good progress on a new upgrade to Agama and a Verus Mobile that should be available in the app store in the not too distant future. @J Oliver Westbrook has also been making progress on VerusPay. Lot's of progress, but I won't rest until PBaaS is humming along üòÉ

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Akira X take in account that all rewards bigger or equal to 96 VRSC are time locked and mature randomly over a time period of 25 months, no pre-mining, no ICO and the age of the chain being just over 10 months...


[01-Apr-19 08:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <J Oliver Westbrook> @SmeLLyArMpiTs regarding your staking question yes, it outputs staking=true only if the check for staking is actually true, it‚Äôs not designed to provide false positives but rather report on the actual state of the process running

[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> hey all! I have the digital proof ready for the physical coin. I have it designed using antiqued silver (antiqued silver shows the details of the coin better, whereas regular silver loses some of the detail when light is shining on it due to it's reflectivity) Let me know what you think! https://imgur.com/maMdtVS

[03-Apr-19 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> keep in mind that in direct light, itll be hard to read since the silver is really shiny. let me know what you guys would rather want. Also, @Thoskk how is the latin phrase opposite (just curious)?


[03-Apr-19 11:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> My google translate tells me it reads `True power can not be bought` in Latin...


[03-Apr-19 11:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @Draeth  When translated into English, the Latin means "True virtue can be will buy" (no typo here).  And it doesn't even catch all, because "virtus" is a female noun, but "verus" a male adjective. English language doesn't care about gender, other languages do.
The correct Latin phrase should be something like "Virtus vera emere non potest". And the "Verus" is gone...


[03-Apr-19 11:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> not really.


[03-Apr-19 11:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @Oink there is no "not" in the Latin.


[03-Apr-19 11:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I know...your translation makes more sense... 
I don‚Äôt know Latin, but since French, Spanish & Italian are all part of the Latin family, i do recognize the structures...


[03-Apr-19 11:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> unless this is some idiomatic phrase that means opposite in Latin ...


[03-Apr-19 11:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I can‚Äôt say, without a full 3-year coarse in Latin


[03-Apr-19 11:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> btw. "emere" may be wrong either ... but I'm not completely sure here.


[03-Apr-19 11:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Ahhh gotcha


[03-Apr-19 11:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> it's been 30 years since I last translated into Latin üòÑ


[03-Apr-19 11:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Actually, I think a proper translator (not google!!!!) should decide what is correct...


[03-Apr-19 11:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> yes, totally agree. Anybody with a Diploma in Latin here? üòÑ

[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> On a side note,  what do you guys think: antiqued silver or shiny silver?


[03-Apr-19 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Antique is visually appealing, but it doesn‚Äôt reflect the new technology


[03-Apr-19 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> not sure if antiqued would match the PCB part

[03-Apr-19 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> is there a way to give it a tempered appearance?


[03-Apr-19 11:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> You trying to go for a coloration when the light hits it?


[03-Apr-19 12:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> something like that ... just an idea


[03-Apr-19 12:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> I'll get back to you on that, I like the idea


[03-Apr-19 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> @Thoskk just got an answer, negative on the tempered look


[03-Apr-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> too bad... but ok, thanks for checking @Draeth  üëç


[03-Apr-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> And a coating on the raised parts, is that possible? ( like glass coatings)


[03-Apr-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Or laser etching?


[03-Apr-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> @Oink  epoxy coatings yea


[03-Apr-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That may give a coloration on reflection


[03-Apr-19 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> One downside is that it wont have a metal feel to the coin anymore


[03-Apr-19 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That‚Äôs true


[03-Apr-19 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But then again: why turn to a material used for many centuries in coins to represent such a modern coin...


[03-Apr-19 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> That's a deep question lol


[03-Apr-19 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763

[03-Apr-19 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> I can do gold,  silver or brass (polished or antiqued for each), black nickel or a combo of the any 2 (which is a bit pricier)


[03-Apr-19 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> @miketout when you get a chance, take a look at Thoskk's comment about the Latin used by Verus


[03-Apr-19 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> what kind of brass? Light yellow, golden, or reddish?


[03-Apr-19 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Golden


[03-Apr-19 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> is it surface coated in any way, or will it oxidise and darken with time?


[03-Apr-19 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> so it could "mature" üòâ


[03-Apr-19 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> As long as it's not exposed to crazy weather elements and extreme temperature it shouldn't. Basically, if you have it on display it won't


[03-Apr-19 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Draeth I defer to Thoskk. we should change it


[03-Apr-19 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I am not an expert in Latin, and we did not have it proofed by an expert who could analyze it at that level of detail


[03-Apr-19 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> I gotcha

[03-Apr-19 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763

[03-Apr-19 02:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i don't have a strong opinion on it, but that is my personal preference

[03-Apr-19 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @miketout  yeah, I think an expert would be helpful. It's not easy to translate correctly into Latin, especially such general statements.


[03-Apr-19 02:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @Draeth  thinking about it, I more and more like a shiny golden brass ... but that's only my personal preference ^^

[dscrdvrsc] <ABK> DP has been working fine for ages, why pull an exit scam when the market starts to look in recovery


[04-Apr-19 03:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Any comment you ever make in this server is fud with no basis in fact and no evidence. Why?

[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> I posted this in the GUI-WALLET channel, but bringing it here in case anyone can help me:


[04-Apr-19 03:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Is anyone able to assist me? I was launching my Agama wallet Native mode after a system update and tried to stop it while the daemon was booting up or something. It gave an error msg stating it cldn't stop, so I X'd out Agama. Now when I try to start it back up, nothing happens when I click on Verus under the native wallet dropdown. I deleted the Agama application (MacBook Pro), then downloaded it again- no difference. Any assistance is much appreciated!


[04-Apr-19 03:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> @Patrick Crypto  thanks for informing me

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @jintaa you may need to delete the associated files in the komodo and agama folders but I think it's a  bit different on mac.


[04-Apr-19 06:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'll do a search and see what I can find and if so will continue this chat in the gui section


[04-Apr-19 06:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> @Godballz -thanks, dude- Oink already helped me sort it out in gui-wallet


[04-Apr-19 06:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Godballz we backup‚Äôd the wallet.dat, removed the complete Komodof older and installed new. Replace wallet.dat & bootstrap and it‚Äôs working

Edit. nvm, saw it from the explorer.


[04-Apr-19 10:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @Draeth  Still working on it, but no answers yet, unfortunately. However, I don't think it will work like intended, because "virtus" still is female, while "verus" is male ... they just don't match


[04-Apr-19 10:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> I'm already looking for alternatives. Unfortunately, almost any possible replacement is either also female, or neuter.  üò¶


[04-Apr-19 11:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> ok @here , I have a suggestion from a former classmate who studied Latin and old Greek: "Virtus vera non potest emi".  Alternative: "Virtus vera non emitur".
However, as expected, "Ver**us**" is gone üò¶


[04-Apr-19 11:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> How about a little alteration: "Verus progressus non potest emi", or "Progressus Verus Non Emitur" ... it's the only thing I can think of to keep the Ver**us**.


[04-Apr-19 11:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> this of course it would be "True progress can't be bought" in English.


[04-Apr-19 12:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> I don't think progress fits will tbh


[04-Apr-19 12:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Well*


[04-Apr-19 12:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> well, I'm running out of ideas and alternatives ...


[04-Apr-19 12:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> How about some synonyms for virtue


[04-Apr-19 12:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Like integrity


[04-Apr-19 12:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> already checked and found nothing; integritas : female


[04-Apr-19 12:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> I got it "true Latin is hard as shit"

[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Confidentiality


[04-Apr-19 12:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> Familiaritas would be closest, and guess what? It's female üòâ


[04-Apr-19 12:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Lol


[04-Apr-19 12:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Excellence?


[04-Apr-19 12:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> make an educated guess... ^^


[04-Apr-19 12:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Female?


[04-Apr-19 12:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> Bingo! ^^


[04-Apr-19 12:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Lol


[04-Apr-19 12:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> How about perfection


[04-Apr-19 12:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> same


[04-Apr-19 12:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> _*most*_ of those simply female...


[04-Apr-19 12:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> How about changing Verus to Vera?


[04-Apr-19 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Lol it would make things a lot easier


[04-Apr-19 12:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> or something more mystical: "Veritas Veritatum, et omnia Verus" ... doesn't make sense, but looks good üòÑ


[04-Apr-19 12:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <austone> what about worth or merit?


[04-Apr-19 12:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> would either be Virtus again, or Meritum - which is neuter.


[04-Apr-19 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> getting confused here üòÑ


[04-Apr-19 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> A bit Harry Potter spell lookalike, veritas veritatum.....


[04-Apr-19 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> originally its vanitas vanitatum, et omnia vanitas ... however... we don't want that üòâ


[04-Apr-19 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Not really...


[04-Apr-19 12:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But since the majority of words describing a character property are female, we‚Äôre running out of options....


[04-Apr-19 12:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> think about a good noun that is  male in your own language ... there isn't too much


[04-Apr-19 12:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Contradictio in terminus


[04-Apr-19 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> no, don't think it works... ^^


[04-Apr-19 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> In Dutch??? I‚Äôm amazed....


[04-Apr-19 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> found it on wikipedia üòâ

[04-Apr-19 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> that's where I found it üòâ


[04-Apr-19 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> but back to topic: Any more ideas for suitable male nouns?


[04-Apr-19 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Consensus is male....


[04-Apr-19 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> yes, this would work


[04-Apr-19 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> We could use that, since the blockchain is a consensus system


[04-Apr-19 12:48 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> seen too many already...


[04-Apr-19 12:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> But when thinking about it, Consensus would be a really good match, because it's simply true üòâ

[04-Apr-19 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Yea you def need a break. I agree consensus works


[04-Apr-19 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> Let's make a voting: When using "consensus", we'd have these: 
"**Verus Consensus  Non Emitur**" or "**Verus Consensus non potest emi**";  English: "**True Consensus Cannot Be Bought**"
Who's for, who's against?


[04-Apr-19 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> final decision would of course be at @team

[04-Apr-19 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Nice going @Draeth! I like how it says that consensus can't be bought, it makes you think how valuable decentralization truly is

[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> @Thoskk I forgot to tell you b that my manufacturer only does antiques brass,  found out last night


[05-Apr-19 09:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> oh, ok, too bad ... I really would have liked the shiny golden coin ^^


[05-Apr-19 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> I can do gold tho


[05-Apr-19 10:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> guess it would be a little expensive, right?


[05-Apr-19 11:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Negative


[05-Apr-19 11:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Same price


[05-Apr-19 11:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> sounds interesting ... how much would you estimate?


[05-Apr-19 12:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> All of the coins i've made thus far (for komodo and pirate) haven't had any special modifications to them (like different edging, dual tone metals, coloring, 3d designs, etc), aside from the antiqued look. So for both KMD and Pirate, it's been $21/coin with free shipping worldwide. The verus coin will be $1 less since there isn't an antiqued effect. Plus, I have tiered bulk pricing with % discounts based off the amount ordered.


[05-Apr-19 12:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Also, I use Veruspay, so you can pay in verus, pirate, kmd, btc and ltc


[05-Apr-19 12:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> (the last 3 use a different payment gateway that's similar to veruspay)


[05-Apr-19 12:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> sounds reasonable... lets see what others say about the gold üòÑ


[05-Apr-19 12:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> kk sounds good


[05-Apr-19 12:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <sundownz> Hey guys. Is there a good profit calculator for VERUS ?


[05-Apr-19 12:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> No, not really....


[05-Apr-19 12:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dakgnosis> @sundownz There is a staking calculator pinned to the staking channel


[05-Apr-19 12:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <sundownz> I am looking at mining... I have 124 pcs Opteron 6380 that I would consider using.


[05-Apr-19 12:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You can check the pinned hashrate spreadsheet in #cpu-hashrate


[05-Apr-19 12:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That can giv you a speed indication.


[05-Apr-19 12:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> *Dual AMD Opteron 6282 31 threads generating 19-20 Mh/s*


[05-Apr-19 12:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That would yield 2-3 VRSC at the current network speed


[05-Apr-19 12:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> So maybe your 124pcs * ~10 MH/s ... loose estimate


[05-Apr-19 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That‚Äôs ***very*** conservative, @zpajk . 6282 & 6380 are pretty similar processors... I would test one and go from there...
I see I missed the *dual*....


[05-Apr-19 12:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> @sundownz You're welcome to try at least one and post your hashrate in #cpu-hashrate , it's always appreciated to gather more comparisons. ^^


[05-Apr-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <sundownz> So like 2 or 3 VRSC a day ?


[05-Apr-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Indeed, of coarse that depends on network speed...


[05-Apr-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I recommend speedtesting one opteron first, so you have a more definitive number


[05-Apr-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Hmm...  > 1 GH/s ... 0,5% of total network hash. 17280 PoW vrsc per day / 0,5% = 86,4 vrsc? 3-4 block rewards per day?


[05-Apr-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I was just checking present network rate. It‚Äôs high again.i stand corrected, @zpajk


[05-Apr-19 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> It's been fluctuating today. 170 GH/s average, maybe?


[05-Apr-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I think so... this afternoon it was 135, so 170 is realistic


[05-Apr-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> @Oink @miketout what do you think, a gold or a silver coin


[05-Apr-19 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I‚Äôld go for silver: less pretentious...


[05-Apr-19 01:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> So, that's 1 vote for silver, 1 for gold lol


[05-Apr-19 01:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Why not make a vote out of it.... mike, hurry with pBaaS, we need to vote... lol


[05-Apr-19 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <sundownz> Yah so like 9 MH per 6380 with the NHEQminer


[05-Apr-19 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Ccminer is a couple of % faster... 130 Watts tdp on that Opteron?


[05-Apr-19 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <sundownz> I couldn't get the ccminer going. These systems don't have any real GPU


[05-Apr-19 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Did you get the right version? I‚Äôll post the link...


[05-Apr-19 01:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <sundownz> They say 115w on the spec sheet.

[05-Apr-19 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Do you have cheap electricity for those systems?


[05-Apr-19 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <sundownz> 7 cents. They've been pretty borderline blah for a while... So been mining to hold


[05-Apr-19 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You couldn‚Äôt even brake even with those rates...


[05-Apr-19 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Unless you want to mine and HODL the coins speculating on a double in value


[05-Apr-19 01:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <sundownz> Indeed. Ive had then for a long time. They were doing great before. For now I'm just not selling what I'm mining on my CPUs.


[05-Apr-19 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You can always mine for ideological reasons


[05-Apr-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> But Verus being 50/50 PoW/PoS, it may feel better to "buy" an amount and then sweetening  the pot with pow rewards for even more stake.


[05-Apr-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <sundownz> So I cannot get that ccminer going at all... It doesn't make ccminer.exe


[05-Apr-19 01:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing...

[dscrdvrsc] <sundownz> Ubuntu


[05-Apr-19 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Got only Ubuntu in VM... no mining on that....


[05-Apr-19 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Ubuntu might be missing necessary lib.


[05-Apr-19 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <sundownz> Ive built many other miners before. This one just not wanting to go.


[05-Apr-19 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <sundownz> I installed the libraries as well. Goes through process of build.sh but no ccminer.exe


[05-Apr-19 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Now I wouldn‚Äôt expect to see an ***.exe*** in Linux, but ok

Hey all! One last vote for the @VerusCoin physical coin. Should it be silver or gold?
Twitter


[05-Apr-19 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> 100% on silver!!!


[05-Apr-19 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <wistar> I like the silver, too.


[05-Apr-19 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @Draeth do you know the "exact" alloy used for the silver coin? I'm thinking about electro plating it myself


[05-Apr-19 03:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> @Thoskk the coating itself i'm not sure. The base material is a zinc alloy


[05-Apr-19 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> the coating would be more important for electro plating. But I can have a look myself when I have it.


[05-Apr-19 03:58 PM] ! zpool.ca | crackers#9719
whats the proper algo for versus? There is haraka, minato and x18 added on the ccminer code... but....


[05-Apr-19 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Don't quite get the question, but the current algo is Verushash 2.0

[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Which I presume is Haraka V2 heavy.

[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @zpajk There is a lot going on in the Verus hashing algo, but I think the most heavy innerloop happens in __verusclmulwithoutreduction64alignedrepeat() , see https://github.com/VerusCoin/nheqminer/blob/master/nheqminer/crypto/verus_clhash.cpp  for the code. There is a lot of haraka stuff happening too, but only one Haraka per inner hash and one call to __verusclmulwithoutreduction64alignedrepeat() which is where most of the heavy CPU happens. They use a lot of Intel SIMD intrinic functions, which are basically integrated functionality inside newer (2012 and later usually) CPUs - these functions are super efficient on the CPU which is why CPUs are better than GPUs on Verus.

[06-Apr-19 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @zpajk Per hash there is (simplified explanation, mind you üòÉ ) first a Haraka 512 with a zero roundkey, then a call to verusclmulwithoutreduction64alignedrepeat() which has a heavy loop with 32 iterations (see the link) and then there is a second Haraka 512 with a rondkey that uses the hash writer buffer. There are other stuff going on with VerusHash per hash, but that's the heavy stuff I think. @Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining can correct me if I'm wrong üòÉ


[06-Apr-19 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining> u missed out. after the first 512haraka hash on the header from the pool. the large mutating round key is created by chaining together 522 x haraka256 hashes to fill it up


[06-Apr-19 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining> but the large key can be used many times as it's before the nonce is applied


[06-Apr-19 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining Yes, but the initial stuff is done only once, that's why I left that part out from my explanation.


[06-Apr-19 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> The initial building is done only once per job, then there are 1 million hashes, each of these hashes has 1) haraka 512 with zero roundkey, 2) call to verusclmulwithoutreduction64alignedrepeat() , and then 3) call to haraka 512 using the hashwriter buffer as a roundkey. Something like that ... üòÉ


[06-Apr-19 02:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining> the first haraka zero is only Done once


[06-Apr-19 02:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Ok


[06-Apr-19 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining> each hash starts with the same round key.  same haraka 512 zero final hash


[06-Apr-19 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining> that's what's transferred to the gpu on gpu miner


[06-Apr-19 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> I though you had to run Haraka 512 with a zero roundkey at the start of every hash on the current hash. I'll look into it again.


[06-Apr-19 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining> no


[06-Apr-19 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining> it's just done to create a 512bit hash


[06-Apr-19 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining> which is then used to make the large round key


[06-Apr-19 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> kk


[06-Apr-19 02:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @zpajk To conclude, I think that if the very complex VerusHash v2 is "heavy" on anything, then it's the Intel SIMD intrinsic functions. More precisely, _mm_clmulepi64_si128, _mm_shuffle_epi8, _mm_aesenc_si128 (that's the Haraka 128 SIMD function), _mm_unpacklo_epi32, _mm_unpackhi_epi32, and finally _mm_mulhrs_epi16.

[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining


[06-Apr-19 02:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> These functions are called repeatetly every hash.


[06-Apr-19 02:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining> luckily ARM  has intrinsic too..  pmull == clmulepi64. and aes .. which is why the rockxhip gets  1mh/s and the raspberry pi without them is 60kh/s

[06-Apr-19 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BigCat45> @Draeth Is there overall mintage for VRSC and KMD coins? Can't find it anywhere.


[06-Apr-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> you mean how many have been made?


[06-Apr-19 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BigCat45> Yes


[06-Apr-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> 100 Pirate coins, 200 KMD coins


[06-Apr-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> I order depending on what I guess the demand will be


[06-Apr-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BigCat45> I see, so there is no defined number, like 5000 coins, no more


[06-Apr-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Well, there will be no more than 200 of the current KMD coins for sure. JL instructed me to make 1 run of them (which is the 200 that were made) due to the rebrand coming soon


[06-Apr-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BigCat45> Got it. Thanks.


[06-Apr-19 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> As far as  the VRSC, more than likely there will be no more than 500 total


[06-Apr-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> I thought about listing this type of info on the site, but it's really hard to estimate


[06-Apr-19 04:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BigCat45> Understandable, as a collector of some high grades, I just can tell that price of the coin depends very much on the mintage (number of all the coins in the world). If that number is flexible, value of that coin is flexible too.


[06-Apr-19 04:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> yea. In the coming months, I will be making a limited run of pure silver coins for Pirate (and other projects depending on demand). THOSE will definitely be limited to like 50 and no more

[07-Apr-19 02:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> hi, i had a q about Agara


[07-Apr-19 02:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> i setup Lite Mode and got a seed phrase, setup a pass etc


[07-Apr-19 02:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> received some VRSC


[07-Apr-19 02:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> then i wanted to start staking...


[07-Apr-19 02:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> Staking is only available in Native mode i assume, and when i setup native mode i was not given any seed phrase or password setup... it just started syncing an dnow is fully synced


[07-Apr-19 02:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> Is this normal?


[07-Apr-19 02:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> Is it also normal that the receive address in Lite Mode does not exist in the Native Mode?


[07-Apr-19 02:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> so when Native Mode syncs I cannot see Lite balance?


[07-Apr-19 02:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @gigamesh It is normal... you can add the address you got in lite mode, by clicking `import key` and entering your seed phrase...


[07-Apr-19 02:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Your address and all it‚Äôs transactions will be added to your native wallet and able to stake.


[07-Apr-19 02:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> thanks @Oink , and is the seed phrase I was given when making Lite wallet the same seed phrase the Native wallet is using?


[07-Apr-19 02:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> i just wana b sure i have backup up everything i need


[07-Apr-19 02:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Seed phrase for lite...


[07-Apr-19 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> If you put it the seed for native, nothings happens, because that address is already in (believe me, I did that the first time üòÇ)


[07-Apr-19 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> i dont understand, so do i have a seed phrase for native?


[07-Apr-19 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> i cant even find the wallet.dat


[07-Apr-19 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> and i havent set a pw either, lol


[07-Apr-19 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @gigamesh when I get back to my PC I will have a better answer but there is a place in settings.


[07-Apr-19 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Don't set password in native. It's not officially supported if I'm remembering correctly


[07-Apr-19 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> ok


[07-Apr-19 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> What OS?


[07-Apr-19 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> OS X


[07-Apr-19 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> The wallet.dat in windows is located in a different location. Not sure where on mac but I'm pretty sure it's a similar set up. Agama calls to two other important folders where important data is held. In win they're called "agama" and "komodo" folders. Gimme a sec, I'll do a quick search and see if I can get better OS X info


[07-Apr-19 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Linux: ~/.komodo

OS X: ~/Library/Application Support/Komodo

Windows: %AppData%/Komodo


[07-Apr-19 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> found it


[07-Apr-19 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Pretty sure VRSC folder has it's own wallet.dat, might wanna make sure


[07-Apr-19 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Oh ok. Good


[07-Apr-19 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> /komodo/vrsc/wallet.dat


[07-Apr-19 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> thanks, so i can backup the wallet.dat but not set a password


[07-Apr-19 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> and in settings recover my seed somehow, is that right?


[07-Apr-19 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> no security concerns staking without pw?


[07-Apr-19 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Ok in agama settings you should be able to import private keys for each address individually but really in my opinion the wallet.dat is the better way anyway


[07-Apr-19 02:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Not necessarily. No real concerns except from the usual basic protection. Don't allow external access or anything


[07-Apr-19 02:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> can i export priv keys too?


[07-Apr-19 02:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> ok , so i import my Lite key to Native and work on Native and send tx's etc and then if everything crashes will my Lite seed phrase still recover my funds? or will all my funds be stored on other keys existing only in Native mode? I would like to have a seed phrase for native if poss.


[07-Apr-19 02:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> thanks @Godballz , and @Oink


[07-Apr-19 02:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> or if i backup and then dlete all Agara folders and start from scratch by setting up Native Mode first, will I then be given a seed for Native?


[07-Apr-19 02:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> and do Native and Lite use the same wallet.dat? sorry for my confusion


[07-Apr-19 02:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> No prob, happy to help and glad you made it here. Each address you create on native will have a private key that can be inputted in settings I believe. One sec. I'll be at my pc


[07-Apr-19 02:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> thanks, if there are any docs ill happily read those too


[07-Apr-19 02:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'll check


[07-Apr-19 02:50 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @Oink  yeah, sorry, had to find a proper symbol üòâ


[07-Apr-19 04:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I noticed...


[07-Apr-19 04:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ABK> Price looks to be still around 14c


[07-Apr-19 04:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ABK> What is the general thinking behind the quick initial release of coins, followed by the supply tapering off? For example, seems that the next block lasts 2 years or so and rewards are halved, so the supply increases quickly at first then slows down considerably  as time goes by


[07-Apr-19 04:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I must check the white paper for that...


[07-Apr-19 05:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> There is still a long time before the next halving


[07-Apr-19 05:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> a year and a half?


[07-Apr-19 05:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> And early rewards are randomly time locked


[07-Apr-19 05:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> @ABK - I had concerns about that as well, and I've addressed them here before- I was afraid that a small grp of us early adopters would end up with this disproportionately large share of the total amount moving forward=oligopoly=less effective, less revolutionary cryptocurrency. @miketout is not worried about this because he feels with the imminent release of PBaaS and merge mining, our early accumulation will be redistributed to newcoming miners and stakers. Also, upon further consideration, I guess I took a look at Bitcoin and realized over 17m of the total 21m are already mined/released, and that's just in the 1st 10 years of its existence. So relative to the mother of all cryptos, I guess VRSC isn't too dissimilar.


[07-Apr-19 05:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @ABK the answer is found on page 21 of the Vision Paper:

During the first 5 months, Verus will have an accelerated reward curve for mining and staking, with a halving every month. During the first two months, when the block rewards are at or above 192 Verus, mined blocks will have time locked coinbase transactions, preventing spending, staking, or transferring of those coins for a period that varies from approximately 3 months after the genesis block, based on numbers of blocks, to 2 years and 3 months. These time locked coins provide a smooth release of the Verus currency supply as well as incentive to all of their owners to support the long term success of the Verus network and project.


[07-Apr-19 05:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> And too much coins generated (in general) equals devaluation...


[07-Apr-19 05:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> @Oink -I think that section doesn't address the concern here. 2 years and 3months is nothing in the grand scheme of such a long term/forward looking project. The concern here is ending up right back at the problem that a "no pre-mine" crypto project was aiming to avoid in the first place. I'm not saying I know for sure it is an issue with Verus, I'm just saying I see the potential for this issue, and think it bears examination.


[07-Apr-19 06:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @jintaa that section covers the question from @ABK just fine. It just doesn‚Äôt cover your concerns, which I haven‚Äôt addressed.
As for your concerns: the presence of large mining farms becoming whales is imho a far greater concern when looking forward, since they destabilize the decentralization.
As for the oligopoly you mention: that it s only a financial position. Without having any backing technology to enforce changes or decisions, it‚Äôs worthless.
I am also confident that a number of investors will release (some of) their coins, once the price of Verus rises sufficiently for them to make a descent profit, thus spreading those coins publicly.
I agree with the vision that after pBaaS is released, the demand for VRSC will grow and the price will rise.
Finally, but most important: a pre-mine will render only the developers with a stash of coins, the mechanism used here avoids that. The developers and the early adopters take a proportional share of the early coins.
Since the early coins are not confined to a closed group, like with pre-mining, it is unjustifiable to use the word oligopoly in this context.


[07-Apr-19 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> It's a matter of degree. The fact that the majority of the early rewards go to 200 early investors as opposed to 20 developers is just a matter of one instance being slightly less bad. THAT'S JUST AN EXAMPLE TO ILLUSTRATE MY POINT. I'm not saying that's the case here. But to say the oligopoly concern is unjustifiable I don't think understands what I'm asking. In any case, the debate at this point is academic: I'm not divesting from Verus anytime soon, and neither is any of us here, so I continue to cheer the team, the community members and the ecosystem on, as always.


[07-Apr-19 06:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Bear in mind that an early supply of coins was a necessity in order to make POS work... network would have been awfully vulnerable without it.


[07-Apr-19 06:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> ok, I see.


[07-Apr-19 06:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But I fully agree on not dumping my VRSC soon, despite the fact that I got onboard only 2 months ago


[07-Apr-19 06:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Emmanuel> there's always dumpers, that's your opportunity to out compete early investors


[07-Apr-19 06:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Emmanuel I haven‚Äôt bought above 2400 sat yet, so I f ully agree


[07-Apr-19 07:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ABK> Thanks for the feedback and discussion @Oink and @jintaa


[07-Apr-19 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @Draeth  Cann you share a bit more info about payment methods? I'm a bit reluctant to use EU credit card due to extra exchange cost.


[07-Apr-19 08:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> @Thoskk I don't accept cards or cash. I accept VRSC, ARRR, KMD, BTC & LTC. I have Veruspay integrated for VRSC and ARRR, and a separate payment gatewya for KMD, BTC & LTC

[07-Apr-19 08:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> no worries!


[07-Apr-19 08:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> I also need to check where I can cut a bit off


[07-Apr-19 08:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I‚Äôll just have to wait for mining payout, which will probably be April 8th....


[07-Apr-19 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> so, here's something cool. I sponsored a couple videos by Voskcoin, who has a pretty decent size audience. i'm hoping to not only get a bigger spotlight on my shop, but a spotlight on projects like Verus and Pirate. The videos should be up next week. i told him to make sure to mention Veruspay as well


[07-Apr-19 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> He should be reviewing my stuff and the verus physical coin currently in preorder

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I‚Äôm in the process of putting all FAQs, How-To‚Äôs and other information that can help (new) users in operating their wallets, running miners and so forth in a central place.
Presently I have my own how-to bootstrapping and the faq‚Äôs from our #faq-chosen copied and online. I‚Äôm still reviewing / renaming / editing / supplementing this info.
What I would love is others to add to, review and rectify this info too.
For now I put that info on my github, but it is my intention to put it onto the veruscoin github and finally create a full-blown help section on the veruscoin website, to reduce the risk of being overwhelmed with help requests of new users in the (hopefully near) future.
You can send your comments to me. If you want access on the repository, that can be arranged.

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I see what you mean, @miketout . The present website is just 1 page with referrals to other pages. Hardly more than a Point of Presence. If a FAQ and/or How-To is added, it needs some work. I had a look at the source and it‚Äôll take me a fair amount of time, but it‚Äôs worth a shot...

[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Hey everyone. So, I usually require 20 coins to be preordered before I get the manufacturer to start producing the coins,  but considering I have no preorders yet and the fact that I truely love the design of the coin, I'll cut the my pre order requirement in half (the reason I have this requirement is so that I know there is interest and I won't be stuck getting a bunch of coins manufactured that nobody ends up buying).

[10-Apr-19 06:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Lol Just received your preorder


[10-Apr-19 06:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Yep, I went over all that with John


[10-Apr-19 06:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> I left it as the default cause I haven't had any issues,  but I'll probably drop it to 5 confirmations


[10-Apr-19 06:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> 20 seems unnecessary


[10-Apr-19 06:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> 20 confirmations is the standard setting... a bit over the top for these kinds of orders...

[10-Apr-19 11:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> I dropped the # of confirmations requirement to 8. That should bre good right?


[10-Apr-19 11:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That should be sufficient... You'll be safer than DP!!!

[10-Apr-19 11:47 AM] Gateway#3763

[10-Apr-19 11:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> I have it on the back side to the bottom right of the eye


[10-Apr-19 11:47 AM] Gateway#3763

```
Question: How can I check my immature balance in the Graphic User Interface (GUI version)?

Answer:

In the Agama wallet click on the hamburger menu (the three stripes) on the top right
click on Settings
click on the last item </> CLI
Select VRSC as coin
Type the following command: "getwalletinfo"
click "Execute"
scroll down and find "immature_balance": which will give you the amount of time-locked coins in your wallet.

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> And if you want to find out when (approximately) they will be unlocked:
https://github.com/Oink70/Verus-Help-Documents/blob/master/FAQ-AllOS/01%3B%20Immature%20block%20unlock%20time%20calculation%20(Manual%20Calculation).md
```
Question: How do I know when an immature block will "unlock" (mature)?

Answer: Follow these steps

Get the values of the current block height ("blocks") and the "blockstomaturity" the distance to maturity of the transaction in question. (i.e. the number of blocks between current block height and where it unlocks. You can see the number is decreasing all the time, and if you add it to the current block height you'll see a constant.)
Apply this formula: blockstomaturity / 1440 = days to maturity (unlocking) e.g. 925558/1440=643 days

[dscrdvrsc] <Lubo> Are some deliverd?


[13-Apr-19 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> No, hardware is ready, bitstream is ready, they are working on ccminer integration... to quote @Cuttlebit‚Äù
```
 I can provide updates with development. The hash core has been done for some time and has been debugged already. Right now we are in the process of modifying ccminer to work with the core over PCIE.
```


[13-Apr-19 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> didn't he talk about pools also?


[13-Apr-19 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> cant find it


[13-Apr-19 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> After they are done with ccminer, they can mine on pools


[13-Apr-19 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That was longer ago, I think


[13-Apr-19 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> thought I read it just recently... hm.. but in which channel...


[13-Apr-19 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Too bad you cannot do a text search in discord....


[13-Apr-19 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> found it:
`CuttlebitLast Thursday at 11:15
Well the hardware definitely exists, I‚Äôve been developing on them. Software-wise just have a wait a little longer till I get it pool ready.`


[13-Apr-19 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Ah... I combined that in my head with needing ccminer to poolmine...


[13-Apr-19 02:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> does it mean the FPGAs will all be directed to one pool?


[13-Apr-19 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I think th y use ccminer, so you can direct it to **a** pool, just like with CPU/GPU


[13-Apr-19 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> so why would it require a working pool to release the machines?


[13-Apr-19 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> or did I get something wrong here?


[13-Apr-19 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> They won‚Äôt ship out the hardware without all the software in good shape


[13-Apr-19 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> of course ... but ... what has a pool to do with it?


[13-Apr-19 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> To test ccminer on a pool you need a working pool


[13-Apr-19 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> there are plenty


[13-Apr-19 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I don‚Äôt know why they set up a public pool of their own.... and make it public... no idea why


[13-Apr-19 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> hm, ok


[13-Apr-19 11:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> Are there any plans in the near future, to address the lack of awareness about Verus? It's hard to buy this coin right now. The buy side of the order book, is a total of 0.35btc... From 2000 to 2200 on the sell side, is 0.35btc... Would you feel like it would be smart to buy in? It also seems like you have a lot of miners and a lot of atakers, holding a considerable amount of Verus


[13-Apr-19 11:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> This is not, I repeat this is not trying to spread FUD.
This is a legitimate question. I see the btc I hold, as valuable. I don't go out and just buy any alt, with it.


[13-Apr-19 11:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @GM  I don't understand what you mean buddy. When the price is low. It's better to buy. This coin is mainly dependent on the main developer mike developing PBaaS. After it is up and running I'm sure there will be a lot more advertising ect.


[13-Apr-19 11:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> @GlorymanRTS Supply/Demand


[13-Apr-19 11:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> It only takes going up 200 Sats on the Sell side, to equal the entire Buy side. But there are several several more BTC of Verus for sale, not buyers though..


[13-Apr-19 11:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> Just keeping it very basic.
So that means it would require a big push from the buy side. That's not to say that people holding large amounts, won't put them on the exchange & sell, at the first sight of an average increase in price


[13-Apr-19 11:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> So, obviously the current community has its money invested. Now you need new btc, which requires a way to reach these new people and convince them that this project is worth investing in. Are there any active campaigns to do that?


[13-Apr-19 11:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> People can't buy, what they don't know about.
Verus isn't on CoinMarketCap


[14-Apr-19 12:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @GM I agree on your assessment that if people don‚Äôt know about Verus, they won‚Äôt buy it. However @GlorymanRTS has an extremely valid point: the current developments are such that when PBaaS is shown to the world and is marketed properly, we won‚Äôt have to worry about awareness. I know the lead dev has had contact with marketing folks...


[14-Apr-19 12:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> @Oink So my points are invalid?


[14-Apr-19 12:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I don‚Äôt recall stating any such thing.


[14-Apr-19 12:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> I think one of the common failures among very apt individuals, is the idea that I don't need to go to the people, because what I am creating--they will come to me..


[14-Apr-19 12:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I will reiterate: if PBaaS is released and *properly marketed*.


[14-Apr-19 12:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> This project has done very significant things.
But where are all the people that should be here?
Nothing @ Stake was big


[14-Apr-19 12:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> It was big


[14-Apr-19 12:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Indeed, we need proper marketing. The technology is great, but the public isn‚Äôt aware of that yet


[14-Apr-19 12:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> The buy side is about to collapse on itself


[14-Apr-19 12:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> It's not like it's like, hey they will come when we get this new tech rolling... You've got a lot of sellers out there


[14-Apr-19 12:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> How can you increase the price, when if it drops to 0.00001000 btc, the sellers will all come down and press on that


[14-Apr-19 12:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> It is creating an unhealthy amount of sellers to buyers


[14-Apr-19 12:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> Every time I want to buy 10k or 20k, I stop myself


[14-Apr-19 12:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> Focusing on one thing for months, then another, it creates more problems. Why not just market consistently?


[14-Apr-19 12:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> It's not a bad thing to market. It's not I'll intentioned.
It's only to spread awareness.


[14-Apr-19 12:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Recently some large pools have adopted Verus, combined with some Chinese farms dumping on a regular basis, which puts the price under pressure. However I‚Äôm not in the position to pump the price, nor am I skilled in marketing. I agree on the disbalance on the markets, but I am confident that if new developments are released and marketed, things will improve.


[14-Apr-19 12:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Stating the obvious, but verus is a community coin, if we want marketing we either need to pay for it or do it ourselves.


[14-Apr-19 12:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Before you decide to invest 10 or 20k or not invest, please take time to read the vision paper and in relation to that the discussion in the #pbaas-development channel.


[14-Apr-19 12:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> The thing with PBaaS is it was developed with the intention of being adopted by a business


[14-Apr-19 12:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> Is that correct or not?


[14-Apr-19 12:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> It is developed to be used (against payment) by 3rd parties, such as businesses, yes.


[14-Apr-19 12:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Simplified it‚Äôs an pay-per-use kind of thing


[14-Apr-19 12:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> PBaaS is being marketed properly?

[dscrdvrsc] <GM> 5 tweets in 4 months about PBaaS


[14-Apr-19 12:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> All from one guy


[14-Apr-19 12:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> Last mention was 6 days ago..


[14-Apr-19 12:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> Itd be difficult for me to say, that you are trying to spread the word about it...


[14-Apr-19 12:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> Look at RedFox


[14-Apr-19 12:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> How come everyone knows about it?


[14-Apr-19 12:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> It's been marketing, for 2 weeks.
Very effective


[14-Apr-19 12:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> PBaaS is supposed to be a game changer.
Why is nobody from the community getting the word out then?


[14-Apr-19 12:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Just revisit the comment @zpajk made.... red fox labs is a business with a budget, we are a community.


[14-Apr-19 12:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> Communities make up a huge part of a project


[14-Apr-19 12:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> Otherwise why would we have them?


[14-Apr-19 12:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> I bet if I scrolled through these channels, I'd find a lot or "experts"


[14-Apr-19 12:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Be my guest


[14-Apr-19 12:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> I'm not going to waste my time..
If they were that talented, they would be assisting somehow


[14-Apr-19 12:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> So fudging after all.


[14-Apr-19 12:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> So, the community is waiting for a release, that will change the project. And the devs are working on it. But there is no active work to reach out to new people.

Sounds like a very relaxed community.. hard working devs


[14-Apr-19 12:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Read the new announcements in #pbaas-development . Info is being published as we speak. Marketing something you have limited info is undoable, even counterproductive.


[14-Apr-19 12:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> Everyone says, just wait for PBaaS...
I'm sure the dev is like, I wish some people would go out and talk about the project... He won't say that but I'm sure he feels that way


[14-Apr-19 12:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> Is anyone trying to develop on top of PBaaS yet?
Community members, I mean.


[14-Apr-19 12:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Since it is not running on testnet yet: I imagine not


[14-Apr-19 12:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> I see.
So maybe I should just come back and see if there is active development on the project, in 6 months.


[14-Apr-19 12:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> more like in a month


[14-Apr-19 12:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> if it will be that long.


[14-Apr-19 12:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> No point in buying, if PBaaS, is one of the last major tech things done on here, and there is no price reaction to it.


[14-Apr-19 12:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> I'm afraid therr are just too many sellers out there.


[14-Apr-19 12:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> whats the point of your fudding?


[14-Apr-19 12:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> Too many Verus that need to be sold.


[14-Apr-19 12:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> By miners


[14-Apr-19 12:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> can you just sto pit?


[14-Apr-19 12:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> thank you


[14-Apr-19 12:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> What?


[14-Apr-19 12:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GM> You aren't admin.
I've raised some very legitimate points in a very cordial mannner.

[14-Apr-19 12:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @GM PBaaS is not 6 months away, and there are people committed to supporting it. at the same time, you are right about some things... 1) devs have been putting all of our energy into doing it rather than talking about it, and 2) we'd love to have some people help with marketing.
At the same time, there are people who want to develop with it, and we expect it to be quite useful to developers and non-developers who want to use blockchains in their applications, start their own projects, or with the reserve features, their own liquid currencies.
Yes, people have been saying wait for PBaaS, but you didn't have to to see a lot of advances already. It has not been quite a year since mainnet, and for the scale of what it is, that is extremely fast. You won't have to wait long at all at this point. I think I'll go to bed tonight without a PBaaS test chain up, but test chains are imminent. It won't be too long from test chains to having fully functional, robust PBaaS, and I fully expect people to be using it.

[14-Apr-19 06:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @Deleted User  Development is not done on Twitter or Reddit. I've seen several projects with constant big announcements about  great ideas and so-called developments in process, and how soon it's expected to be released - and not few of them are in these "develpment process" since many months, if not years. 
Thus I think it's wise not to make big announcements before you can provide anything substantial. Because if you don't, neither the project nor the community would benefit, if not even damage is done .


[14-Apr-19 11:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> I don't think @GM was fudding- I've raised many of the same concerns myself in this discord. If anyone looks at an order book as thin as what he describes on DP and doesn't think that's something to at least be potentially concerned about, they're not paying attention. At the same time, I see Mike's response to his concerns, and I understand it's a tough balancing act. We really all shd be doing more to market, at least once PBaaS is up and running. I also get the other side that says we don't want an influx of attention and interest before Verus is ready for Primetime, as that cld be a disaster in itself...I personally am waiting for PBaaS to be spun up and running before I start pounding the marketing pavement, so to speak. Also, I think it would be helpful if we cld get some direction, however minimal from the team. If @miketout said hey guys- wait till after PBaaS, then go wild, or it doesn't matter- call it out from the rooftops whenever and wherever, however- that'd be another form of direction. I've been thinking of talking to Chico Crypto about our community, but tbh, I'm not sure what to do- wd the community and Mike appreciate it (Chico isn't everyone's cup of tea)? If we do get an influx of interest right now, wd it be like calling in new guests to the dinner table before the feast is ready? I'm truly unsure of our direction here. And these blind accusations of FUD! whenever someone raises a legitimate question don't really help all that much, I don't think.  I love this project and this community, and I'm here for the long haul. I just think these are valid points.


[14-Apr-19 12:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> It did start with a legitimate concern indeed, but during the conversation a couple of points started to look suspiciously like fudding:
- Although he entered this server moments before he raised his concerns, he didn‚Äôt shy from calling the entire community ‚Äòrelaxed‚Äô, while the devs work like crazy. That assessment looks not to be based on facts.
- He claims he can find experts on this server, but doesn‚Äôt want to waste his time.
- when he‚Äôs friendly asked to stop, he indicates that it‚Äôs not an admin asking, so why should he...

I call that fudding...


[14-Apr-19 12:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> From what I remember, mike said in one of his earlier announcement that the concept of PBaaS is better explained if people can actually see working examples of what is possible. (Must be over a month or so ago)
In my head I can see lots of possibilities of what can be done with PBaaS, but explaining those visions to others is a different story (at least for me).
I agree (as you already know) that we need marketing, but since it is not my field of expertise, I can but follow.
I disagree however that it is mike that has to say when to start: he is the prime developer, visionary and his opinion in this bares much weight, ultimately it‚Äôs the communities decision.


[14-Apr-19 12:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> Though I don't think we should hurry. Haste makes waste,  and this project is ment to be something for the future.


[14-Apr-19 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> True.. personally I think that all the people complaining about the low VRSC price are just looking for a quick profit, not staying for the long haul.


[14-Apr-19 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @jintaa @Oink @Deleted User @0x03 @Thoskk and all... thanks for your caring about the project and discussion. in fact, I have gotten the first PBaaS chain "up" and am now working through issues. "Up" is in quotes because it is not quite self sustaining yet. We are well on the way, and though I am still going to be heads down for a few more weeks as we bring in all the features, the hardest part of PBaaS is in place. I think it would be a good thing for people to feel fine spreading the word at this point. I just thought it might be harder to be successful at and have less impact before everyone is armed with details of how PBaaS works, which is coming soon. Letting people know about what we're doing is great, but we will be able to arm you with solid information on a new, multi-chain, decentralized PBaaS protocol very soon. Verus PBaaS will allow anyone to launch a chain through the Verus network that includes leveraging all of the Verus network's infrastructure, miners, and stakers, steps for pre-sale on the chain, and making merge mining, staking, and notarization of your chain/project/application an offer in both Verus and its native currency for the participation of the entire Verus network, now and in the future.


[14-Apr-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763

[15-Apr-19 07:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <wookie> getting dumped hard. oh well


[15-Apr-19 09:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <1,3> is  vrsc asic/fpga resistant?  why is there a fgpa channel?


[15-Apr-19 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Verus is ASIC resistant. FPGA's can run on the network, but a FPGA-miner that is affordable and runs at comparable H/W ratio haven't hit the market (yet).


[15-Apr-19 09:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <1,3> fpgas will still have huge advanges over gpus  if it can hit the market.  so there's still risk there that can not be predicted now?  do you think this is something that's very hard to solve?


[15-Apr-19 09:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> Currently there are probably no/not many fpgas on verus, I believe.


[15-Apr-19 09:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @1,3 nothing needs solving. We want equalization of different hardware bro, including fpgas.


[15-Apr-19 09:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> VerusHash  uses specific algorithms (vcmul) which are built into modern CPU's. FPGAs can do that work, but not yet at a rate where they are comparable to the efficiency of a modern CPU


[15-Apr-19 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Of coarse a 600Watt FPGA will run a better MH/s than a 65W Ryzen 2600...


[15-Apr-19 09:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @Oink what do you mean FPGA is not comparable to the efficiency of a CPU?


[15-Apr-19 09:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> I believe that FPGA are already doing better MH per watt than any CPU can do...


[15-Apr-19 10:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <1,3> i dont know much fpgas,  but what i remember  it is just a slower version of  'asic' that are more flexible.  so no matter what algorithms are being used ,  fpga can adapt,  right?   and  how easy and how long that is?


[15-Apr-19 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @That_Guy8 that's what  @Oink is saying. Fpgas are bettwr


[15-Apr-19 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @GlorymanRTS " but a FPGA-miner that is affordable and runs at comparable H/W ratio haven't hit the market (yet)."


[15-Apr-19 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> he is saying the exact opposite


[15-Apr-19 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @That_Guy8 oh. He means the black miner f1 I think he owns one.


[15-Apr-19 10:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> I think he means in terms of investment. Maybe mis wrote a bit.


[15-Apr-19 10:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @1,3 yes fpgas can adapt and create bitstreams buddy.


[15-Apr-19 10:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Well its bad info, Go get the price in hardware it would take to get the over 250MHs from standard PC hardware. then compare that to the 2k USD for the F1


[15-Apr-19 10:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> I feel like the F1 would be the more cost effective and better MH per watt


[15-Apr-19 10:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @That_Guy8 yeah, but cpus don't require an initial investment if u already have one. Also, to buy a better one is more versatile and holds its price better than an fpga. Also, anyone who buys a f1  fpga could just mine a coin that gains 50% more profit than verus. So, I think what he is saying is reasonable.


[15-Apr-19 10:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @1,3 if it were easy, they would be on the market, I presume. How long it‚Äôll take before they hit the market? Could be next week, could take a while


[15-Apr-19 10:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <1,3> it allow cpu gpu fpga at the same time.    it seems this way you always have to worry    about  someone creating a more efficient fpga  someday?  it's not clear,  why didnt verus choose to be a asic mined coin,   that seems to be a better option to me. but i don know.


[15-Apr-19 10:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I‚Äôm using the info on reported speeds in hashrate channels. Probably F1 has updated by now, but no new figures in the hashrate channels.


[15-Apr-19 10:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I think if the asic owners want an easy mineable coin for asic, they should create one themselves. Verushash was created with decentralization in mind. CPU‚Äôs are well distributed, asic‚Äôs aren‚Äôt.


[15-Apr-19 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <1,3> i see!


[15-Apr-19 10:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That is why FPGA‚Äôs are not necessarily bad, if they can be bought at reasonable prices. It helps distribution. If they are expensive, they‚Äôll promote centralization.


[15-Apr-19 10:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> The aim of verus algo was to be proportional. Aiming to have the cost of hardware vs hashing power be fairly even across the board


[15-Apr-19 10:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <1,3> i guess that's not easy. a lot of coins try to be asic resistant.


[15-Apr-19 10:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Future will tell if we really are resistant...


[15-Apr-19 10:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @GlorymanRTS unfortunately I don‚Äôt own a F1... $2000 is out the question for a hardware investment for me and I won‚Äôt take out loans for hobby equipment...

[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> Ill bet it wont really even need the fan


[15-Apr-19 11:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But 22MHs at 50W versus, I‚Äôll wait for the 70MHs at 80W from UKMiner.


[15-Apr-19 11:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> Mine will be inside my threadripper case with just a heatsink. All the air movement will keep it cool


[15-Apr-19 11:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> Double the price too


[15-Apr-19 11:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <wind> No fan is needed if mine VERUS with F1-mini


[15-Apr-19 11:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Wind: if I can place a heat sink on a device, I will... better safe than sorry... üòÄ


[15-Apr-19 11:32 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Got 1 GPU in my rig, I cannot switch off RGB without s/w installing, which I don‚Äôt want on my rig... tempted to cut some wires....


[15-Apr-19 11:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> You just install it. Turn it off. Then uninstall


[15-Apr-19 11:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @Oink wouldn't even need to cut. its just a plug on the GPU PCB


[15-Apr-19 11:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> My strix 2080 ti has a button right on it to go dark

[15-Apr-19 11:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> Then yeah, just unplug it


[15-Apr-19 11:37 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Way to go  @Oink! Looks great! Tested on android chrome, I'll give opera a try with the data saver cranked and see how it goes. Nice work and way to go  @basti while I'm at it, getting the word out there! This is what makes Verus a formidable community project!


[16-Apr-19 05:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Thank you @Godballz , for your nice words and for testing!


[16-Apr-19 06:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> No prob man, thank you too for the hard work. Not to mention being an inspiration! Every project could use a few more  @Oinks. This is the kind of community efforts that make me feel that there is hope for crypto and if everybody pitched in just a little we could move mountains. (Merkle mountains?üòÜ )
Oh, works well and looks great on opera mini as well (with data saver on high) btw.


[16-Apr-19 06:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> We‚Äôre going to move entire Merkle Mountain Ranges!!!

[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> @Oink working with Seamonkey. Just one note: Under "Phase 2", last line, "It will some work to get it finetuned, though" could use a little rephrasing üòâ


[16-Apr-19 06:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yeah, indeed, it does...


[16-Apr-19 06:55 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @Draeth How's production getting along? ^^


[16-Apr-19 10:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> It's going well,  just talked to the factory cause they had to make some minor adjustments since the circuitry inside the V was too thin, so we got that resolved.


[16-Apr-19 10:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> I should be receiving them in a week to a week and a half


[16-Apr-19 10:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> I'll make a post updating the status when I have an estimated date to receive them,  the day I receive them,  and the day I ship out the preorders


[16-Apr-19 11:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> So, how many orders did you finally get?


[16-Apr-19 11:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> 2 lol


[16-Apr-19 11:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> I got them manufactured anyways in the hope that there will be more orders later


[16-Apr-19 11:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Which is something I try to avoid but I really like the project


[16-Apr-19 11:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Thanks for the support, @Draeth


[16-Apr-19 11:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Any time! Keep up the great work!


[16-Apr-19 11:23 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Whoa whoa whoa, what on earth will I ever do if my "V" doesn have ridiculously small circuitry? üòÇ 
Jk  
The coins look awesome. If it isn't too much trouble to answer again and since I'm sure it's already been said, but how would one go about getting one again?

[16-Apr-19 11:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> there's a good chance that in 10 years all will regret not to have ordered their hard coin ^^


[16-Apr-19 11:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> In that case getting a numbered one, will be a good investment.... everybody here should see the investment value and buy one!


[16-Apr-19 11:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> And #1 will be the most valuable...


[16-Apr-19 11:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> first series will not be much worse, too ^^


[16-Apr-19 12:00 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> hehe ^^


[16-Apr-19 12:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> But yea,  I def need to keep track of each individual one to make sure the right number goes to the right place


[16-Apr-19 12:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Same thing with the pure silver pirate coin im designing


[16-Apr-19 12:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> guess right now it's still not too difficult üòâ


[16-Apr-19 12:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Lol Yea, not too bad atm


[16-Apr-19 12:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Hey!!! Don‚Äôt!!!


[16-Apr-19 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> If i buy 10, 11 and 100, I‚Äôll have a ‚Äòdigital‚Äô set...


[16-Apr-19 12:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> I think your on to something.... maybe I should add in a number request to the order form


[16-Apr-19 12:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> At a premium, of coarse!


[16-Apr-19 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Or an auction on the special numbers


[16-Apr-19 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> I bet most people would not know what "digital set" has to do with 1, 10, 11, and 100 ... which reminds me that there are 10 kinds of people in the world: Those who understand binary, and those who don't.


[16-Apr-19 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Haaahahaha


[16-Apr-19 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> That's awesome


[16-Apr-19 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> üòÇ what about the other 8? ü§£


[16-Apr-19 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> _exactly_


[16-Apr-19 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Draeth you can always release a digital set when this one is sold out...


[16-Apr-19 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Or a Prime set.. (only prime numbers...)


[16-Apr-19 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> next would be Fibunacci ...


[16-Apr-19 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> And I could think of an elemental set ... numbers of masses of most abundant isotope per element... üòÇ


[16-Apr-19 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Whoehahaha


[16-Apr-19 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Or a Fuzzy logic set


[16-Apr-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> hm... and a Schroedinger set ... you won't know if the coin is there until you open the box... ^^


[16-Apr-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Is the coin alive, or is it dead?


[16-Apr-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> Lol


[16-Apr-19 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> ok, there are endless possibilities ^^


[16-Apr-19 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> An Infiniti set...


[16-Apr-19 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> yep, or a gogol-set ^^


[16-Apr-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> to make it shorter


[16-Apr-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I think the invisibility set would be cheapest...


[16-Apr-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> not sure ... ever tried to buy invisible metal?


[16-Apr-19 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> It‚Äôs also infinitely thin


[16-Apr-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> It calls Graphene a fatty!


[16-Apr-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> hey, does anybody in here own an atomic force microscope? So it could be build of several gold atoms .. ^^


[16-Apr-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Didn‚Äôt  Wistar post something about that last week

[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining> @VoskCoin yeah the fastest I can get from a 1080ti is 6-7 Mh/s so not sure how much more is possible.. great video . been watching you since the start üëå


[16-Apr-19 11:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining> 5watts @ 1Mh/s $35... not bad either (you can get them cheaper than $55)

[dscrdvrsc] <aikida3k> What is the total number of coins mineable and what is the effusion schedule? I haven't even  been able to google it.


[17-Apr-19 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Indeed: great video!


[17-Apr-19 12:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @aikida3k I think you want to know that specifically for Veruscoin? In that case I‚Äôll refer you to the white paper on the https://veruscoin.io website. In the #faq-chosen channel you may also find some info on it, but not complete.

[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> <https://veruscoin.io/downloads/papers/VerusVision.pdf> Page 21, and max supply 83 540 184.


[17-Apr-19 12:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @zpajk Did you **finally** read the white paper .... üòÖ


[17-Apr-19 12:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Looked up the emission a few months ago, to understand an inconsistency in the staking spreadsheet between two 24 block reward stages. But the fault isn‚Äôt important at this point in time.


[17-Apr-19 12:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I noticed that inconsistency...


[17-Apr-19 01:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> I was not sure about the exact duration of each phase when I made the spreadsheet, and I didn‚Äôt want to bother Mike with that small detail at the time. He was quite busy, as always, and if needed I could change the value if it is off target. Happy to update the file if confirmed.


[17-Apr-19 01:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Jabberwok> hi


[17-Apr-19 01:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Cragorn Mike will have to confirm the values...


[17-Apr-19 01:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Hi Jabberwok


[17-Apr-19 01:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Jabberwok> omg what is this wallet


[17-Apr-19 01:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Jabberwok> not really user friendly at all


[17-Apr-19 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Yeah, no offense intended, @Cragorn. Kudos for making the spreadsheet either way! I dm:ed you about it a while back, where I also sent my interpretation of the eras.


[17-Apr-19 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i'm not a fan of agama either btw, i hope we will have a **proper** wallet GUI some day


[17-Apr-19 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> anyways.


[17-Apr-19 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> could some agama user help me test something, namely getting the zcash params off veruscoin.io ?


[17-Apr-19 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> thankyou


[17-Apr-19 02:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> @superbig can you DM me please if you still cannot download zcash params off veruscoin.io - i just tested it successfully


[17-Apr-19 02:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> @zpajk I remember. I didn‚Äôt reply then because I was busy at work, and forgot. I knew about the difference when I made the spreadsheet, but it was set up as well as I was able to when trying to interpret the timing of the block halvings. I sent the link to Mike to have him check it out. Shortly after it was published in #faq-chosen


[17-Apr-19 02:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> Here is the info I based the spreadsheet on.

[17-Apr-19 02:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Publication in #faq-chosen should mean they checked it... So we can assume it is correct...


[17-Apr-19 02:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> My interpretation.
Era, reward amount, from blockheight, blocks until next stage. 
```var rewards = [
 [1, 0-384, 0, 10079],
 [2, 384, 10080, 43199],
 [2, 192, 53280, 43199],
 [2, 96, 96480, 43199],
 [2, 48, 139680, 43199],
 [2, 24, 182880, 43199],
 [3, 24, 226080, 1051199],
 [3, 12, 1277280, 1051199],
 [3, 6, 2328480, 1051199]
];```


[17-Apr-19 03:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> and then halving every indefinitely every 1051200 blocks (approximately 2 years)


[17-Apr-19 03:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> BTW @zpajk That's how I interpreted it too.


[17-Apr-19 03:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> BTW, I am just converting that FAQ about the XLS sheet to web format, so I'll skip it for now, untill I get some confirmation on the 24VRSC period.


[17-Apr-19 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Exactly, and with the clause that ‚Äúblocks until next stage‚Äù is free for interpretation as ‚Äúfrom blockheight‚Äù is the important one.


[17-Apr-19 03:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> For me, that what is in the white paper is leading information, but I need to be sure that is also actually what the blockchain is programmed to do...


[17-Apr-19 03:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But FAQ-8 and the whitepaper definitaly contradict eachother


[17-Apr-19 04:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <VoskCoin> @Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining haha certainly deserved some air time, with my research you‚Äôve been doing a lot ‚Äî for awhile too! & that‚Äôs cool to hear! Thanks for the support üòÑ


[17-Apr-19 04:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <VoskCoin> @Godballz thank you üòÑ progress and profitability more than merits it


[17-Apr-19 04:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @VoskCoin hey buddy. I'm a fan of yours. I got into mining beam and grin because of you


[17-Apr-19 04:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You were a day early with your show... LOL... Trying to finish FAQ's so I didn't have to answer them individually.... LOL


[17-Apr-19 04:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Good show, though!


[17-Apr-19 04:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <VoskCoin> @Oink that would make things too easy if we synced up üòú

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> only 7 left....


[17-Apr-19 04:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <VoskCoin> @GlorymanRTS that‚Äôs awesome glad I could help! & thanks for the support üòÑ


[17-Apr-19 04:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @VoskCoin good to see you in the verus community. I still need to watch your verus video. Also, I just bought at radeon vii


[17-Apr-19 04:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You didn't mention UKminer... I was a bit surprised by that, though...


[17-Apr-19 04:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> Yeah, nice to have you here Vosk üòÉ


[17-Apr-19 04:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <VoskCoin> @GlorymanRTS nice what do you plan to mine with it? & if you don‚Äôt mind I‚Äôd love your feedback on my latest video, what you liked, didn‚Äôt like, want to see more of etc


[17-Apr-19 04:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <VoskCoin> @Oink if you look at my browser I actually had ukminer open


[17-Apr-19 04:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <VoskCoin> But I forgot to actually talk about it ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


[17-Apr-19 04:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @VoskCoin Are you going to do a show about the merged mining possibilities as soon as PBaas is live?


[17-Apr-19 04:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @VoskCoin hey bro, have you heard of RITOCOIN. Sure bro, I will watch it and write out some thoughts. Also, I will experiment with radeon vii and see what seems best.


[17-Apr-19 04:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <VoskCoin> I guess it will have to be an Easter egg for now ü•ö


[17-Apr-19 04:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> I am a community leader at ritocoin. We would love for you to consider making a video. We have some very unique features on RITO coin including a curved block reduction. @VoskCoin


[17-Apr-19 04:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @VoskCoin maybe you could try buying the ukminer and make a video


[17-Apr-19 04:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <VoskCoin> I‚Äôll have to look into it, I‚Äôm slammed into May currently though 

Have any ukminers shipped yet?


[17-Apr-19 04:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> ukminer seems like the best value for money FPGA


[17-Apr-19 04:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Try if they send you a promotion sampler...


[17-Apr-19 04:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @VoskCoin not yet, soon upfully


[17-Apr-19 04:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <VoskCoin> @Oink I‚Äôll certainly cover it, unsure when


[17-Apr-19 04:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining> I dont know if anyones has seen my new webchain miner, they just forked away from cryptonight to make it more GPU resistant, but i think it may of had the opposit effect and a GTX 1060 gets 535h/s and a i7 8 cores about 200 h/s tahts doesnt tsound CPU biased to me..


[17-Apr-19 04:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @Oink that's a great idea!


[17-Apr-19 04:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <VoskCoin> @Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining what‚Äôd they fork into?


[17-Apr-19 04:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @ukminer17 @CryptoYeti fancy sending @VoskCoin a review sample of your FPGA for advertising?


[17-Apr-19 04:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining> its a Lyra2 algorithm with a 6MB buffer needed perf thread


[17-Apr-19 04:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining> Lyra 2 doesnt use any CPU advantages like AES, or other special cryptographics buiult in stuff


[17-Apr-19 04:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> I'm just keeping my cpu miner on verus and i need to work with whatever is best with radeon vii


[17-Apr-19 04:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining> so a GPU can do it fast, if i was mioning now id be mining it , along with verus of course


[17-Apr-19 04:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining> @GlorymanRTS when you goign to let me team view in so i can tune the webchain miner toi get 2000h/s on it then you can exchange to Verus


[17-Apr-19 04:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> is it better than 75 on eth.


[17-Apr-19 04:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> you want access to my radeon vii?


[17-Apr-19 04:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> or my cpu?

[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> i had to stop selling recently too. made a few lifestyle adjustments


[17-Apr-19 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I only invest money I can miss. In my mind it‚Äôs written off... I‚Äôll have a look at them in 15-20 years.... It was for my retirement, but that m already retired... LOL


[17-Apr-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> that's why it's better to sell _before_ the crash


[17-Apr-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gr1mB3an> can this coin be mined on a laptop?


[17-Apr-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> sure, look at the rates of respective CPUs: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RrSYJDV0Mjj3X-myMC3aQDGkcipivxHsD7ZxJ3r5f_A/edit?usp=sharing

[dscrdvrsc] <Gr1mB3an> even solo mining?


[17-Apr-19 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> if you have some patience ... although for single CPUs, pools would maybe be the better choice

[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> uhm, dunno, don't have current rates at hand


[17-Apr-19 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Depends on network difficulty.


[17-Apr-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> I think with around 200 - 250 MH/s, you should get a block a day... approx


[17-Apr-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> although that's not what youre notebook will produce üòâ


[17-Apr-19 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gr1mB3an> yeah, I am thinking just around 3MH/s is possible, dont want to stress it that much

[dscrdvrsc] <Gr1mB3an> based on the calculator 5MH/s will result to 1VRSC per day lol

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Every coin stakes if you run the wallet in Native mode, but for a daily stake you need about 23k


[17-Apr-19 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> look


[18-Apr-19 06:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> i dont mean to sound ungrateful, even though I am. A "tip" of 1 cent is hardly amusing, and irregardless I will buy more VRSC. **What I am saying** is that tipping new community members such minuscule sums is not good. Better to not tip at all. While the price rests at $0.10 per coin it is (IMHO) abhorrent that anybody should tip  amounts less than that, particularly when coupled with risible comments. This community is about to explode, and if the incumbents cant appreciate the interests of new members over the value of 1 penny, then the the cypherpunk roots of this coin are *truly* compromised.


[18-Apr-19 06:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> It shouldn't be only miners who are rewarded for engagement. This is why bounties exist. It behoves this community to "share the wealth" in a manner more beffitng its crypto-anarcho "God Dammit, Lets change the World" manifesto

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> And we have the bounties you talk about... Have a look at #active-bounties


[18-Apr-19 06:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I can say from my own experience that community members that are actively involved in the community will not be overlooked


[18-Apr-19 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I personally am not a huge fan of the tip thing myself, but I can understand its value. I will say that even finding .01 vrsc tip with my name highlighted, means something to me more for the thought than the actual coin. Not to mention that .01 could be worth quite a bit some day. I probably would never cash out my discord name anyway, always considered it a pay it forward, fun sorta thing.


[18-Apr-19 06:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That's just one perspective though. I'm just grateful to be here, along for the ride!

[18-Apr-19 07:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> @gigamesh Just to clarify, you understand you‚Äôve been tipped by a community member and not by the team for your efforts? I fail to see if you‚Äôre discouraged by tipping service or if you‚Äôre actually wanting to be compensated by the team through a bounty instead. As said before by someone else; there are active bounties already listed, and if not the team might value efforts enough to reward either way, but that doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with tip or rain functions by the tip bot.


[18-Apr-19 09:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> @zpajk ofc i was not seeking team compensation. in fact i was oblivious to the bounties (I will now check them). what i did object to (perhaps wrongfully) was the dispensation of such ridiculously small tips (e.g. 0.05 VRSC), that any benevolence intended  would patently be lost in transaction (Lost in Translation, lol)

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Let me check the pinned excel spreadsheet from #cpu-hashrate for that.


[20-Apr-19 12:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> reported hashrate for that CPU vary between 4.7 and 10 MHs


[20-Apr-19 12:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> So, 8 MHs sounds fine


[20-Apr-19 12:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Zero C00L> Ok thanks.  Just joined the discord a few min ago, so wasn't aware of that pinned

[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @gigamesh As one of the creators of Microsoft .NET - one of the worlds most popular frameworks for programmers after Java - Mike has a pretty impressive background for sure.

[20-Apr-19 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> that's only part of the resume, there is even more interesting stuff to discover, like 3D printing electrical circuits etc. yes @Ted i agree "the code speaks for itself", but if you don't code (like me) that doesn't help so much. So you research what you can. Learning a bit about Mike's past has been a real treat. I mean, he helped build Microsoft.

[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> In line with the recent rumblings of more awareness for our great little project that could, and the community's efforts to that end, I have  a question about veruscoin.io. Has there been any discussion about updating/upgrading it? It is the first destination most people will go to learn about our project, and the biggest aggregated source of more data and knowledge on the project- it directs people to the code, whitepaper and vision paper, the wallet, all social media, etc. Being the main landing point for all newcomers, I was wondering if others thought it needs more? I know it's not a priority, compared to the actual work of building the whole point of the website itself, but is it considered important enough by the team and community to get a facelift and upgrade?


[20-Apr-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763

Which tokens would you like to see migrate to #Binance chain?
Twitter


[21-Apr-19 10:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> But Verus is not a token, and why would we want it on BNB chain?


[21-Apr-19 10:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> it's about BNB DEX, if I got it right, and it would bring some publicity and demand (hopefully)

[dscrdvrsc] <ABK> I have a little side bit of Verus that I want to keep safe for a rainy day, is there any material risk in keeping this balance in a wallet that I have the pass phrase for, but nothing else (no wallet.dat)...? Seems a coldish type option?


[21-Apr-19 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @ABK as long as the passphrase is sufficiently strong and you really can't lose/forget it, it should be fine. if anything happens to your memory, of course, then it's gone.


[21-Apr-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ABK> @miketout it‚Äôs the seed phrase that generates the private keys in the wallet, guessing this would be secure? Yes major risk is then losing the paper it‚Äôs written on...


[21-Apr-19 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ABK> @miketout congrats on this project too, it‚Äôs shaping up amazingly well


[21-Apr-19 09:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @ABK thank you! As I said, it‚Äôs a community effort, and I think this is just the beginning. Maybe I misunderstand your question. You cannot reconstruct the whole wallet from just the HD seed in the wallet. There is a way to generate the Sapling addresses, but only the Sapling addresses are HD. I would recommend either keeping your funds in one address, for which you have the private key, or backing up your wallet or wallet dump file (see z_expoerwallet).

[22-Apr-19 03:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You stepped away from using nheqminer in your docker, Crupti?


[22-Apr-19 03:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Or are you still maintaining that too?


[22-Apr-19 03:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> If you have NVidia Docker 2 and nvidia drivers on your host OS already it should be as simple as
**$ docker run --runtime=nvidia --rm crupti/verushash-ccminer-cuda -a verus -o stratum+tcp://na.luckpool.net:3957 -u VERUS_T_ADDRESS.WORKER**
to download and run ccminer 3.4.

[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Oink I still support nheqminer too, this is a seperate Docker image.

[22-Apr-19 03:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Oink Docker is OS portable, so it¬¥s not "Linux Docker" - just Docker. You can use Windows or even UNIX has a host OS as long as you have Docker on it.


[22-Apr-19 03:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Tnx for the info. Didn't know that. I'll change it. (I'll start thinking on the icon to use... LOL)


[22-Apr-19 03:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Even though the Docker container internally runs Linux, your host OS can be whatever.


[22-Apr-19 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> That¬¥s kind of the point and what's neat with Docker, in addition to better security and scalability etc.


[22-Apr-19 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> TBH, I hadn't heard of *Docker* before I got into the Verus community.


[22-Apr-19 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Oink It¬¥s basically virtualization software, taken to a new level.


[22-Apr-19 03:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Docker runs an OS inside your OS, and in our case, runs the ccminer in the virtualized OS - which also make it more secure as it¬¥s a seperate OS from your physical host OS (which can be whatever, Win, Linux, UNIX)


[22-Apr-19 03:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> As soon as I got some time i'll read up on it... Virtualization is always fun


[22-Apr-19 03:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Right now I'm using Vbox, so Docker would be an alternative...


[22-Apr-19 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Maybe even converting my Vbox with Local VerusPool into Docker...


[22-Apr-19 03:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Oink Virtual machines, like VMWare, Hyper-V, VirtualBox, etc, usually have horrible miner performance - with Docker I get can¬¥t find any significant performance degregation.


[22-Apr-19 04:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I'll read up on it, at some point in the future. No too far away, I hope


[22-Apr-19 04:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> hmmmm. got a demo shop in VBOX too, for testing Veruspay. The VHD performance is terrible (The website runs on database, common problem in virtualization)... Would that improve too, or mainly the CPU performance?


[22-Apr-19 04:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Oink Docker is espesially handy when it comes to mining, I mine multiple coins which miner software all require different OS¬¥s and OS versions, different libraries and library versions, different compilers and compiler versions, etc, without Docker you would have to install new OS and software each time your want to switch coins, with Docker it¬¥s just a single command to switch the coin I want to mine. In addition, I don¬¥t always trust the code of the mining software and Docker runs in it¬¥s own OS which is more secure than running the miner directly from your host OS - with Docker any potential hacker would have to break out of the Docker OS to get access to your host OS, which is hard to do.


[22-Apr-19 04:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Oink You use Docker Volumes instead of VHD¬¥s. Their performance depends on the platform implementation.


[22-Apr-19 04:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I'll definately have some reading to do... and if my gut doesn't deceive me: some reconfiguring, transplanting, migrating and whatnot...


[22-Apr-19 04:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> I wish this all wouldn't always take so much time to get into... I'm already spending a good part of my leisure time for all of this, and it doesn't seem to get less with each new development üò´


[22-Apr-19 04:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> so much for "computers make it all easier" ... dafagg they do ...


[22-Apr-19 04:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Well, if it aint broke, don't fix it....


[22-Apr-19 04:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> different thing


[22-Apr-19 04:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> it's more about what you have to do to get it halfways safe and secure


[22-Apr-19 04:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> The main reason I'm going to look at docker is to see if I can get that verusPay test site running smoother...


[22-Apr-19 04:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> yes, Docker sounds great, just I'm so not motivated to setup another thing on top of all others again...


[22-Apr-19 04:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But I agree, every new technology is a steep learning curve, eating away time


[22-Apr-19 04:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> absolutely


[22-Apr-19 04:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> The LAN pool runs fine on VBox, so i"ld leave that alone, if I were you. (Unless I 'transplant' it into Docker before you have yours up)


[22-Apr-19 04:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> if people had to spend the same time with learning about new things in their cars that is necessary to get your IT safe and sound (as far as possible), you wouldn't see a tenth of the new cars on the streets that you currently can see.


[22-Apr-19 05:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Hahahaha. So very true


[22-Apr-19 05:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> well, setting up my other machine is more tricky than I thought ... having driver issues for the GPU. At the moment it only works correctly when I'm logged in from remote üò¨


[22-Apr-19 05:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That‚Äôs annoying.... but at least you still have access... I‚Äôve experienced complete lockouts, only to be solved by taking out the offending hardware.... (LOOOOOOONG time ago)


[22-Apr-19 05:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> well, that times have passed for me when NT technology came up for windows, luckily. Had this a few times with Win95 and ME, though...  install, restart ... nothing.


[22-Apr-19 05:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> but it was comparably easy to get it fixed.


[22-Apr-19 05:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I used to have an ancient PCI VGA card for those cases....

[22-Apr-19 05:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Oink It¬¥s pretty simple to learn Docker. The Dockerfile describes what should be done, if you look at the ccminer Dockerfile then it¬¥s simple to understand. First the FROM command tells it to download a nvidia linux distro that has CUDA 10.1 preinstalled. The first RUN command updates the linux distro in the FROM and installs all the compilers etc - the next RUN line does all the downloading and building of the ccminer software on the linux distro specified in the FROM, then I just create a new on the linux distro in the FROM line so that you won¬¥t have to run as root - and your basically done. Easy üòÑ

[22-Apr-19 05:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> useless at sea!


[22-Apr-19 05:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> with a 5¬º" floppy and an option for a second one


[22-Apr-19 05:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> and an EEPROM slot


[22-Apr-19 05:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> no option for 2nd floppy, they had a 30MB 5.25"HDD


[22-Apr-19 05:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> wow!


[22-Apr-19 05:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That hardrive alone wheighed in at 7 kilo's


[22-Apr-19 05:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> I think mine would still work, I just have an issue with the floppy, it's on endless loop ... guess one of the ICs should be replaced.


[22-Apr-19 05:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> and cleaned!


[22-Apr-19 05:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> clickety clickety click...


[22-Apr-19 05:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> already did that, didn't help


[22-Apr-19 05:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> and I'm not a master in soldering, so I refrained from removing the IC myself üòâ


[22-Apr-19 05:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> oh, that was another device... That was the ZIP drive... Click of death...


[22-Apr-19 05:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> oh, ZIPs ... I hated them. Totally unstable and always broken when you needed them.


[22-Apr-19 05:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I har a firewire version, worked reliably for 5  or 6 years...


[22-Apr-19 05:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> we just had SCSIs


[22-Apr-19 05:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> external


[22-Apr-19 05:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> My father in law had the combined SCSI/parallel version


[22-Apr-19 05:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That was a disaster!


[22-Apr-19 05:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> probably same ... just remember SCSI, but may have been that one though


[22-Apr-19 05:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You had a parallel, SCSI and a combined one... That was about ??? al lot more expensive


[22-Apr-19 05:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> we had them ad university, for data backup ... well, was more of data breakdown after all


[22-Apr-19 05:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> The firewire I had from work: one of my colleagues was a soldering whizzkid and replaced the parallel interface for a firewire interface for me


[22-Apr-19 05:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> we switched to tape instead üòâ


[22-Apr-19 05:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> After that you had the Jazz-drive... I never thoughed that one, though


[22-Apr-19 05:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> those had enormous capacities, compared to other media at that time


[22-Apr-19 05:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Tapes were just as unreliable.... Our Sa's never bothered to verify the backup every once in a while....


[22-Apr-19 05:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> did he? Hm, never had issues with those


[22-Apr-19 05:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> And when they needed them.... They turned out to be corrupt...


[22-Apr-19 05:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> the trick was an antimagnetic casing ^^


[22-Apr-19 05:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> or rather a magnetic shielding, to put that in proper terms


[22-Apr-19 05:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> If you don't regularly replace the tapes with fresh tapes... After 4 years of continuoes use you cannot expect them to hold all the data


[22-Apr-19 05:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> hm, can't remember a single tape that was corrupt... we used them for about 5 years before CDs came up


[22-Apr-19 05:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> but those were much less reliable


[22-Apr-19 05:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> especially the first versions


[22-Apr-19 05:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> We reccommended to replace your DLT tapes every 2 years for a fresh set


[22-Apr-19 05:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> We never really used CD for backups, unless a customer wanted a copy. Then we'ld supply them a CD/DVD


[22-Apr-19 05:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> one of the Professors recommended to print the data, which he considered to be the safest way... we made a joke and made a printout of a program in assembler code and asked him if he could put it back into the computer ... after that, the ZIP drives came in ^^


[22-Apr-19 05:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Hihihihi... Just supply the good professor with a thermal printer... Gnagnagna


[22-Apr-19 05:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> hot needles... oh yeah


[22-Apr-19 05:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Just like your cash receipt from a supermarket... Leave it in the car for a week during summer.... Not readable!


[22-Apr-19 05:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> doesn't need summer, a strong source of light will be enough


[22-Apr-19 05:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> indeed.... I would love to see that professors face when he finds out!


[22-Apr-19 05:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> or a weak source and time


[22-Apr-19 05:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> yeah, that's also what I'm always angry about ... you need the bill for guarantee things, but after a year it's bleached ... great


[22-Apr-19 05:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I always scan an copy bills I may need for warranty in the future


[22-Apr-19 05:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> And staple the original to the copy


[22-Apr-19 05:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> i just put them in aluminum foil... also works ... but it's not a treat anyway


[22-Apr-19 05:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But, proof of payment should be sufficient, so if you can produce a bankstatement with the payment on it, it should suffice.... Most stores don't accept it without a fuss, though


[22-Apr-19 05:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> luckily most cases happen within the first 2 or 3 weeks, and at least the discounters don't make much fuzz if you bring their stuff back... they just pay you back and put it back into the shelf again... üò¶


[22-Apr-19 05:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yeah, indeed. At those places I rummage through until  I find a box that isn't tampered with


[22-Apr-19 05:52 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Thanks @Crupti @Oink and all! Stop by the #pbaas-development channel and try some merge mining üòÉ


[23-Apr-19 10:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> I had to google merge mining https://www.cryptocompare.com/mining/guides/what-is-merged-mining-bitcoin-namecoin-litecoin-dogecoin/

What is merged mining ‚Äì Bitcoin & Namecoin ‚Äì Litecoin & Dogecoin?
Merged mining is the process of allowing two different crypto currencies based on the same algorithm to be mined simultaneously.

[23-Apr-19 10:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> You learn something new every day in crypto üòÉ


[23-Apr-19 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @miketout  Will merge mining be possible on every PBaaS chain after Verus goes live or just now on testchains?


[23-Apr-19 11:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> yes. this is the only system I know of that allows you to dynamically merge mine up to 15 chains, and when PBaaS goes live you will still be able to connect to and merge mine up to 15 chains on any source of hash power


[23-Apr-19 12:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> merge mining is great with p2pool


[23-Apr-19 12:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> they killed auxpow though


[23-Apr-19 12:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> so returns are shit compared to what they used to be


[23-Apr-19 12:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> How‚Äôs this going to go with pools?


[23-Apr-19 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Pools will have to load additional deamons, clients mine like nothing happened.
You will probably have to make some ‚Äújsons‚Äù in pool_config to accommodate the new coins, like you would normally add another coin in the pool.


[23-Apr-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I think it‚Äôll be pretty straightforward...


[23-Apr-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Ginasis Mining Pools


[23-Apr-19 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> pools should be able to offer great merge mining, but the reward calc and payouts will be a little work, since they can come from up to 15 different chains at once. there will be some work to do for pools to offer more profitable merge mining and differentiated features, but basic mining won't change that much.


[23-Apr-19 01:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> best way to merge mine i found out is to open a p2pool and remove the dev fee and you earn all the merge coin from their hash power


[23-Apr-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Hey that's a pretty cool way to do "dev fee free" pools! ^^ could be better for em even. Nice to have options either way! It's a bold new world!


[23-Apr-19 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Isn‚Äôt that what PBaaS basically accomplished, just with a different technology, @Codeman ?
@Godballz get on installing that VM, it‚Äôs configured to be fee free... (although it can be put back in)


[23-Apr-19 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I‚Äôm sure s-not can be adapted for PBaaS merged mining...


[23-Apr-19 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> How can the miner control how many coins he's mining at a pool?


[23-Apr-19 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Not... if the pool implements a deamon for one of the autochains, you would automatically mine it...


[23-Apr-19 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Your miner mines the same hash as now, but since the autochains connect periodically to veruschain, you get the rewards for notarization and mining for all blocks since the last connection (presently 8 blocks)


[23-Apr-19 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> So pools can't use the miner's work just for themselves?


[23-Apr-19 02:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> They could, if they sneaked in some extra deamons to mine Autochains not on the site. But that would involve that autochains coin, not the notarization...


[23-Apr-19 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> hm.. well, if there's a way, somebody will do it I'm afraid


[23-Apr-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> At least, these are my deductions based on what I understand of the merged mining process... if I make a *booboo*, please correct me...


[23-Apr-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> need to "compile" more info first, though... we'll see what else can emerge from those possibilities.


[23-Apr-19 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> And from what I saw my test mining do tonight,,,


[23-Apr-19 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Hmmm, playing with the idea of cloning my private pool and see what happens if I put it on the test chain.... next week, maybe...

[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> endless ponderabilities üòÑ


[23-Apr-19 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Luckily I added  next week and maybe.... don‚Äôt need pressure right now


[23-Apr-19 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> as I said, take a break... too much brainwork isn't good, too üòâ


[23-Apr-19 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Correct... spent an hour at pc and closed my eyes for another 2... it‚Äôs getting better, so we‚Äôll see what a nights rest will do to me...


[23-Apr-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Every chain mined in a header can be determined by the miner. If a pool added chains that they did not payout for, they would be easy to expose.


[23-Apr-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> ok, so there's a chance to catch cheaters ... that's good to know ^^


[23-Apr-19 10:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gr1mB3an> When did mining start at Verus. I am seeing a lot of coins in circulation. I saw this at coinpaprika

[23-Apr-19 11:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gr1mB3an> 39 981 198 (48.00%) is this correct cir supply?


[23-Apr-19 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Pretty much. Yet, a lot should still be time locked.


[23-Apr-19 11:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gr1mB3an> I see. How much is timelocked?


[23-Apr-19 11:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Hard to know exact amount without going through the whole chain. Early rewards above 192 vrsc were time locked to be "randomly" released the following 2 years.  *"During the first 5 months, Verus will have an accelerated reward curve for mining and staking, with a halving every month. During the first two months, when the block rewards are at or above 192 Verus, mined blocks will have time locked coinbase transactions, preventing spending, staking, or transferring of those coins for a period that varies from approximately 3 months after the genesis block, based on numbers of blocks, to 2 years and 3 months."*

[24-Apr-19 11:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I wanted to write something myself but I haven't used it yet and don't know enough to speak comfortably about it


[24-Apr-19 11:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Oh well if you do, maybe I can find some obscure subs to link it later


[24-Apr-19 11:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Just read my tweets... that should cover the average reddit reader... whoehahaha


[24-Apr-19 11:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I‚Äôm actually not a reddit-fan... I try to avoid it whenever possible...


[24-Apr-19 11:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Dont blame ya. I like to read random stuff but the community is garbage


[24-Apr-19 11:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Most Reddit‚Äôs in /crypto are just links to other places... not wasting my time on that.

[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> My wife took the pictures and due to the shinyness of the coin and the lighting she took it in, the lettering is hard to read. I'll take better pictures tonight


[24-Apr-19 12:10 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> So, I cant blame my wife for the picture... shiny is an understatement lol. These things are haaaarrrd to get a good picture of to show the words


[24-Apr-19 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> that's really difficult. You could try with dimmed light coming from a flat angle, and the reflecting surface mirroring a white background (ceiling or alike).  
However, when zooming in a little, it's better:

[dscrdvrsc] <J Oliver Westbrook> By the way, anyone who's interested, I just announced in #veruspay - the new release of VerusPay, v0.3.0, is now out!  Be sure to follow the guide (either install or upgrade) carefully.  Although VerusPay v0.3.0 is in the WordPress library, you must follow the steps and run the appropriate script on your wallet server first.  See the channel there for details!  üòÉ


[24-Apr-19 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <J Oliver Westbrook> This version includes wallet management features, new security layers, and KMD support


[24-Apr-19 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <J Oliver Westbrook> and a bunch other stuff, that's the highlights


[24-Apr-19 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> I'll be doing this in about an hour


[24-Apr-19 06:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> anyone who has ideas of how we might want to get all of this information out, I'm going to stop by the marketing channel and discuss all of the news we have and ideas for getting the word out. feel free to join and contribute

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Firing up Veruspay VM to upgrade...


[25-Apr-19 12:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> FYI everybody, besides an excuse from CryptoYeti **nothing** has happened since i requested my refund. it's about 24hours now.  i was also asked to contact ukminer17 about the refund, which i did, also nothing.


[25-Apr-19 01:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> So besides radio-silence on their discord, no DM's?


[25-Apr-19 01:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I just pinged them. I will go to sleep and check back in the morning.


[25-Apr-19 01:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> @Oink: roughly around the time i wrote to their discord yesterday i sent a DM to CryptoYeti, to which he responded with a similar excuse that he also posted in their general channel, additionally asking me to contact ukminer17 as he has control over the funds. and since then the ether has gone silent.


[25-Apr-19 01:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Well, from what I've seen, Ukminer17 isn't the best communicator...of the ukminer group, that is...


[25-Apr-19 01:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But I supposed your BTC wallet hasn't grown since your message too...


[25-Apr-19 01:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @Oink who is the communication winner of the group? üòÇ


[25-Apr-19 01:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @GlorymanRTS You tell me!


[25-Apr-19 01:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> if they actually did a silent refund i'll laugh my ass off. i had DM contact with both ukminer17 and CryptoYeti at time of preorder making sure they'd account for my changelly transaction correctly, to which they both positively responded that they would do so.


[25-Apr-19 01:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> that would've lost me the money and i'd be very amused


[25-Apr-19 01:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> üòÇ


[25-Apr-19 01:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> however that would mean correct refunding

[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> I was guttered that I missed opportunity to dump yesterday. Price went from 2200 to 1980 üò≠


[25-Apr-19 01:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> and bitcoin went from 5.6k to 5.4k


[25-Apr-19 01:31 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Still talking about prototype boards over a month after initial ship by date


[25-Apr-19 06:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> They don't realize it, but they're digging a deep, deeeeeeep hole right now...


[25-Apr-19 06:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I'm actually too pissed off, to react sensibly on their discord, so I won't.


[25-Apr-19 06:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I think serious missteps were made with the entire fpga reaction from the time the f1 was found out about


[25-Apr-19 06:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> but hey who am I


[25-Apr-19 06:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> so... ukminer = scam?


[25-Apr-19 06:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I don't think its a scam as much as probably just a few guys being too ambitious, and got in over their heads


[25-Apr-19 06:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> And now they don't know how to get out


[25-Apr-19 06:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I think they have fucked up, but probably not out of malice


[25-Apr-19 06:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I am in a state, that I will personally bring that company down


[25-Apr-19 06:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I think the fork was premature, I think announcing this board for the bounty was as well. As far as I know they have not received the bounty, but they profited from the announcement but have yet to deliver


[25-Apr-19 07:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> I stand by the fork and don't think it was a overreaction. I believe we'd be worse off if it continued. Other than that I agree that preordering anything is really risky, and their time estimates have been way off, but I see nothing wrong in keeping an open mind about which board to use. It should be the same fpga chip and their supplier is said to be ready to ship either way. That's my interpretation.

[25-Apr-19 10:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @wookie and @zpajk thanks for documenting that. it was one of our longer periods. Even with those longer blocks, we do average 1 minute blocks. We have had long blocks periodically, but that was unusual. In any case, it is still within the statistical norms and can happen. There is some newer research on methods to reduce the high variance, and we will be looking into potential improvement in that area after rounding out the PBaaS work.

[26-Apr-19 05:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I'm heavily thinking about a staking pool (based on s-nomp) with  automatic periodical payouts and a web-interface for putting in stakes. The database behind it tracks the stakes entered and takes care of the automated payouts on PROP base...

[26-Apr-19 09:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> True, @zpajk , Which simply means they feel threatened by our tech, because they know it's going to hit them financially in the end...

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> As @Oink mentioned, Verus has unique algorithms for a number of things, like proof of power (PoS/PoW), addressing nothing at stake, and further enhancing Komodo crypto conditions to enable PBaaS with merge mining, which has just started early testing. Right now, we're focusing on the next update of PBaaS testing, to make the autonotarization and payouts fully functional, and then reserve conversions.

[26-Apr-19 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> OK...  Sounds like a corrupt chain to me...


[26-Apr-19 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> First thing I would try is bootstrapping...


[26-Apr-19 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> yea. problem is, both vrsc and arrr stopped running and don't want to run


[26-Apr-19 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> so literally nothing wants to run


[26-Apr-19 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> 3x bootstrap.... That would be weird...


[26-Apr-19 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> yea


[26-Apr-19 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> if you don't have enough diskspace, you would have ran into trouble earlier...


[26-Apr-19 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> are you on a VM at your provider?


[26-Apr-19 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Or do you have a dedicated server?


[26-Apr-19 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> dedicated server


[26-Apr-19 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> i did run out of space, but i upgraded


[26-Apr-19 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <J Oliver Westbrook> i think you need to wipe your db and chain data and get the bootstrap again


[26-Apr-19 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <J Oliver Westbrook> so go in your /opt folder and for each coin folder in there, go in, go into the all caps folder within, delete everything EXCEPT FOR YOUR wallet file. Your wallet file is named something like ‚Äúvrsc_store.dat‚Äù


[26-Apr-19 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <J Oliver Westbrook> then from within that same folder download the bootstrap for that chain, unpack it, after unpacking delete the tar file, then start the chain


[26-Apr-19 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <J Oliver Westbrook> my guess is when you ran out of space your db or block data got corrupted


[26-Apr-19 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <J Oliver Westbrook> let me know if you‚Äôd like me to fix for you, i‚Äôm happy to do so, you‚Äôll just have to give me ssh access


[26-Apr-19 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> that worked! you rock!


[26-Apr-19 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <J Oliver Westbrook> Woop!


[26-Apr-19 05:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> So, long story short, I was still having space issues (I need to look into what is taking up space that shouldn't be there). I ended up creating a new volume with enough space to hold the kmd bootstrap, moving the kmd bootstrap there, then unpacking it into the correct directory


[26-Apr-19 05:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> now everything fits


[26-Apr-19 05:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Draeth> testing now to see if everything works


[26-Apr-19 09:39 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <superbig> But it doesn't show that it's sent out.


[27-Apr-19 03:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> At what block? Or the transaction id? Don't want to type each character from an image.

[27-Apr-19 03:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Thanks.
<https://explorer.vrsc.0x03.services/address/R9g49XDc9gqvi5dkeEGJBenrtAWJ6MT7fz>
So it's on the explorer, so it's just not only your wallet messing up.
You haven't sent the transaction yourself, which indicates that someone else has access to your address and/or wallet.
And seeing how it's sent to a private address there is no way of tracing it, but even if it was possible there's not much to do about it.


[27-Apr-19 03:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <superbig> Are you sure it was stolen?


[27-Apr-19 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> It was sent out from your wallet, by someone other than you, to an external address. So unless you've forgotten about sending it to a service handling private z-addresses (like CryptoBridge) then they're most likely transferred by someone other than you to their own address.
Has anyone had access to your computer handling the wallet? Backups of the wallet.dat? WIF keys? Are any of those stored on an online services where your login credentials may be compromised, like e-mail auth? Are there any file sharing services running on the device you've got copies of the wallet on that could have been hacked?


[27-Apr-19 03:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <superbig> The wallet papers were never passed on to anyone else.


[27-Apr-19 03:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> And of course the risk of malware getting installed, stealing files like crypto wallets.


[27-Apr-19 03:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <superbig> The machine is a new system. Kill with anti-virus software, no poison


[27-Apr-19 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Seeing how you've been staking the amount you're running a native wallet which uses an wallet.dat file located on that device. If that has been stolen then they've got access to every address.

Brand new system? Cheap shady device with preinstalled OS from the internet or from a respectable retailer?


[27-Apr-19 03:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> guess a pwd for sending would really not be a bad idea.


[27-Apr-19 03:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Except wallet.dat is still unencrypted.


[27-Apr-19 03:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> right


[27-Apr-19 03:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Which it needs to be to stake.


[27-Apr-19 03:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> so the pwd had to be stored elswehere, in an encrypted way


[27-Apr-19 03:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Else paper wallet with BIP38 is reasonable.(The address becomes encrypted with password, and needs to be decrypted with it to use.)


[27-Apr-19 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Don't get me wrong, @superbig, I feel really bad if that's the case, but I'm only trying to state the vulnerabilities and what could have happend. I hope you the best!
I'm off to rake some leaves.


[27-Apr-19 04:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @zpajk omg u can get ur wallet stolen by buying 2nd hand pc!


[27-Apr-19 04:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> I wish there was some kind of list of ways to secure crypto wallets. So, computer noobs like me can protect ourselves.


[27-Apr-19 04:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @GlorymanRTS  Well, if you buy a cheap PC from the internet, with pre-installed OS, the **very least** thing to do is: Make a fresh install of the OS (you should have the key if it's Windows), get a firewall and antivirus of your own choice, choose a safe password and don't login as administrator or user with high privileges.
But it's probably better not to buy a cheap/used machine if you aren't sure how to take care of. You wouldn't buy a used and probably modded car if you wouldn't know more or less exactly that it's ok and compliant to regulations... could also cost you a lot on top.


[27-Apr-19 04:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GlorymanRTS> @Thoskk thanks bro. Yeah, I will load a fresh install of windows. I wish I was more computer savy.


[27-Apr-19 04:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @GlorymanRTS  don't forget to backup important data to external drive before erasing the OS üòÑ


[27-Apr-19 04:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> just don't make an image of the OS and put it back on afterwards üòâ


[27-Apr-19 05:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> @superbig


[27-Apr-19 05:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Relaunch agama with -reindex


[27-Apr-19 06:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> Kind of looks like 16-20k was dumped on DP.


[27-Apr-19 06:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Sure does look like that


[27-Apr-19 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> volume on the last candle 24k


[27-Apr-19 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Hardware wallet staking now please


[27-Apr-19 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> @GlorymanRTS Yeah, it's probably a very lucrative "business" idea. Sell cheap devices with malware and hope to strike gold sooner or later.


[27-Apr-19 06:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Why you should be careful with any USB device with storage, or ones you think "what could be the harm of charging the device with my computer's USB port instead of the assigned adapter?".


[27-Apr-19 06:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ABK> Geez that‚Äôs my worst nightmare, seeing unrecognised outgoing transactions from the old wallet


[27-Apr-19 06:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> I mean, we live in a time where malware can pretty much fit in a USB cable connector and not the device itself.


[27-Apr-19 06:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @zpajk just 1% would make nice extra profit...


[27-Apr-19 06:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> He didn‚Äôt screenshot any movement of 21k coins that I saw


[27-Apr-19 06:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> He needs to reindex


[27-Apr-19 06:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> He did post screenshots, about 4 hours ago.


[27-Apr-19 06:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Missed the second pic


[27-Apr-19 06:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> That sucks


[27-Apr-19 06:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Why is he still using sprout addresses there?


[27-Apr-19 06:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Odd transaction fee too


[27-Apr-19 06:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Wouldn‚Äôt happen to be Australian would he?


[27-Apr-19 07:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> That guy bought that wallet


[27-Apr-19 07:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Just a wild guess


[27-Apr-19 07:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Not impossible scenario either.


[27-Apr-19 07:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> That would be the only realistic explanation I could think of


[27-Apr-19 07:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> talking about wallet papers


[27-Apr-19 07:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Don't know about the vulnerability in the older wallet version. Screenshot didn't say which version


[27-Apr-19 07:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Either way there's not much to do about it.


[27-Apr-19 07:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Just learn.


[27-Apr-19 07:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Yup


[27-Apr-19 07:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Milk has been spilled


[27-Apr-19 07:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <superbig> This is my wallet. I don't know why there are three transactions.


[27-Apr-19 07:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <superbig> The wallet version is up to date


[27-Apr-19 07:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> How did you get the 21k?


[27-Apr-19 07:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> By the amount of immature balance I‚Äôd guess early mining and investing. ‚úåÔ∏è


[27-Apr-19 07:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> So if they have an immature balance, they are unable to move those coins right? If the wallet is compromised, then the attacker can try to move them when they mature?


[27-Apr-19 07:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Yes.


[27-Apr-19 07:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> They are in other addresses, but if the whole wallet is compromised then the immature balance is as well.


[27-Apr-19 07:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> @superbig Only thing he can try to do is to transfer coins as soon as possible after each of the blocks mature. Needs to be faster than the hacker. If not he might lose the rest of the coins (immature) too.


[27-Apr-19 07:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> Find out how long for each to mature and plan on transfer within minutes of maturing.


[27-Apr-19 07:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> If I were a hacker I would have that automated within seconds. I advice **transferring** all remaining transferable fund to a new wallet on a trusted machine


[27-Apr-19 07:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Would it be worth moving the wallet to a new machine?


[27-Apr-19 07:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Or is it more than likely the attacker has the keys


[27-Apr-19 07:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> Wont make a difference if he has the wallet.dat


[27-Apr-19 07:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> That's what I figured, but thought maybe it's someone with another form of access


[27-Apr-19 07:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Ssh, Remote Desktop in some form....


[27-Apr-19 07:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Either only that transparent address is compromised (he mentioned paper wallet) or the whole wallet.dat. The later would mean that the immature balance is also compromised and will be game of who is faster to transfer them when they mature.


[27-Apr-19 07:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> And @Oink has a great point. If this is a hacker with halft a brain he wont spend time waiting for doing this manually, but make a script to run automatically and snag the maturing coins within seconds.


[27-Apr-19 07:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Winbloze, launch command prompt and netstat -a


[27-Apr-19 07:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I know of an easy way to accomplish this, but for safety reasons (or to give folks bad ideas) I won‚Äôt elaborate here...


[27-Apr-19 07:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> There are shielding scripts, like in Oliver‚Äôs article, so there‚Äôs nothing special about it.


[27-Apr-19 07:36 AM] Gateway#3763

[28-Apr-19 04:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> Didn't have major issues on Stex yet.


[28-Apr-19 05:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @JS STEX is ok, but the Verus volume is still much lower on STEX than on Digitalprice - that¬¥s probably why people still prefer to use Digitalprice


[28-Apr-19 05:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> well, if the chosen exchange  is not doing what it should - why stay there?


[28-Apr-19 05:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Thoskk With you 100%, but I think there has to be a critical mass that starts to use STEX before it becomes popular.


[28-Apr-19 05:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> I'm critical and I'm using it üòÑ


[28-Apr-19 05:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> jk


[28-Apr-19 05:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> Stex is not a bad exchange, just the KYC for trading FIAT is annoying - but that's common on many, if not almost all


[28-Apr-19 05:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Thoskk Sure üòÉ I meant that perhaps if 1/4 of all volume was on STEX then almost everyone would start to use STEX, atm it¬¥s usually like 4-5% of the volume every time I check.


[28-Apr-19 05:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> sure. And everyone may choose his favourite exchange of course. On the other hand, volume is more relevant for dumpers I think, traders need patience üòâ


[28-Apr-19 05:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Spread is also a lot higher on STEX than on Digitalprice, I suspect (just guessing here) that this has something to do with the low volume on STEX also.


[28-Apr-19 05:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> yes, I also think so.


[28-Apr-19 05:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> But I¬¥m no trader, so just my amateure opinion, folks üòÑ


[28-Apr-19 05:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> each opinion counts ^^


[28-Apr-19 05:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Thank you üòÑ


[28-Apr-19 05:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Currently, there¬¥s 18% spread on STEX for Verus - that¬¥s a lot in my op.


[28-Apr-19 05:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> My reasoning is; Higher volume equals more competion between buyers & sellers, which in turn causes lower spread percentages. Basic market dynamics, I guess.


[28-Apr-19 05:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> DP has maintenance every other week? I haven't noticed.

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That will also show you the current coinsupply in the top line.

[28-Apr-19 09:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Do you want the pictures I posted on Twitter, so you can insert them directly?

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Godballz


[28-Apr-19 09:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> if you wanna. I just did it as a quick thing and I figured anyone interested enough might just go check out all the useful stuff on your twitter

[28-Apr-19 09:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> what do you think? i can add em no prob


[28-Apr-19 09:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Or you post it on Reddit o Medium


[28-Apr-19 09:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> mostly just a compilation of stuff in one place with a little bit of new


[28-Apr-19 09:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Let me read the new version and DM you the screenshots I made


[28-Apr-19 09:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> i dunno reddit has a new whitelist thing. i thought maybe if i did put it on medium that they might be whitelisted but its insane you have to jump through hoops to talk openly about crypto


[28-Apr-19 09:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I'm am now officially allowed to open my mouth....üòÇ


[28-Apr-19 09:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> actually I think I can get em off twitter


[28-Apr-19 09:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I liked the twitter shout out and felt the link less relevant if I only put the pic..


[28-Apr-19 09:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> the community effort I feel, is a big part of the draw


[28-Apr-19 09:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> If it's OK with you I'll see if I can put it on Medium, link to it on Reddit and tweet about it...


[28-Apr-19 09:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Fine by me, might be better if someone else did, come to think of it


[28-Apr-19 09:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> should i do anything?? hah


[28-Apr-19 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> prob better if  I do post, I do it after anyway. I know how reddit can be touchy


[28-Apr-19 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I would rather you do it, so I just have to link/like/retweet... I feel uncomfortable showing off other peoples work like this... People may easily mistake it as being of my hand.


[28-Apr-19 09:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Just minimize mthe credits to me... The entire community and especially the development team should be credited


[28-Apr-19 09:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> maybe hold up a sec. i just threw this together. I know its old stuff but I also dont wanna misrepresent


[28-Apr-19 09:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> i dunno?


[28-Apr-19 09:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> i dont want credit, Id prefer if it went out like that


[28-Apr-19 09:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> ok now i feel like im cluttering the page I'll DM ya


[28-Apr-19 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> We‚Äôll call you: *an appreciated community member*‚Äô (@Godballz)

[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> @Godballz  Hyping up the FPGA guys? üòâ


[28-Apr-19 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Trying to hype up EVERY guy AND girl!!! @Badfish


[28-Apr-19 11:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> damn formatting


[28-Apr-19 11:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I know... I was convinced I put the thw CLI images next to eachother...


[28-Apr-19 11:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> haha


[28-Apr-19 11:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> hello Verusians. Just to confirm: Roughly 10% of the total supply has been mined (~9mio), which places the market cap at slightly under a million bucks?


[28-Apr-19 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> 
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/449638035999686677/572126877637017610/PBaaS-_The_Age_of_Merged_Mining_is_Upon_Us2.docx


[28-Apr-19 11:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> the answer is in there?


[28-Apr-19 11:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> No sorry I was in the middle of trying to post that


[28-Apr-19 11:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'm not sure of the market cap


[28-Apr-19 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> supply is around 9 mio right?


[28-Apr-19 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I wanted to post this as an easy source to find info on the new stuff


[28-Apr-19 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Bout 40mil I believe


[28-Apr-19 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Bit more


[28-Apr-19 11:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> ah really?


[28-Apr-19 11:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> so around 50% has been mined?


[28-Apr-19 11:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> or 40% whatever


[28-Apr-19 11:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> same emission curve as ARRR?


[28-Apr-19 11:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yup... about a bit under 50% is still timelocked, so 22M available to trade/stake


[28-Apr-19 11:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> was there a halving already or is it coming?


[28-Apr-19 11:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> 50% was mined, 50% was staked. The PoP algorithm keeps that level


[28-Apr-19 11:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> @Oink tell me about the timelock pls


[28-Apr-19 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> All blocks with a value over 192VSRC were timelocked and released at a random point within 24 months each.


[28-Apr-19 11:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> This is done to gradually release the early coins, not to flood the economy


[28-Apr-19 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> The actual schedule of release was:
```
Era 1:
Block 0 - 10080 reward: 0 to 384, rising linearly and changing each block
Era 2:
Block 10080 - 53279 reward: 384 Block 53280 - 96479 reward: 192 Block 96480 - 139679 reward: 96 Block 139680 - 182879 reward: 48 Block 182880 - 226079 reward: 24
Era 3:
Block 226080 - 1277279 reward: 24
Block 1277280 - 2328479 reward: 12
Block 2328480 - 3379679 reward: 6
. . . halving indefinitely every 1051200 blocks (approximately 2 years)
```


[28-Apr-19 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I quoted the white paper


[28-Apr-19 11:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> thanks


[28-Apr-19 11:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> do we know the source of randomness?


[28-Apr-19 12:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Sorry for the delay, I needed to refuel my stomach...
I don‚Äôt remember having it seen in the white paper, but you can always check.


[28-Apr-19 12:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <kingcolex> So whats going on?


[28-Apr-19 12:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <kingcolex> Seems like none of the exchanges are working


[28-Apr-19 12:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> DP was down, but it looked this morning that there was activity. Let me check again.


[28-Apr-19 12:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Apparently it was short lived on DP.


[28-Apr-19 12:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Stex is active.


[28-Apr-19 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @kingcolex DigitalPrice has 0 volume on all coins it seem, I¬¥m guessing that they are down for maintanance this weekend.


[28-Apr-19 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Only some VRSC activity today. I hate it when it's out and there's no word about it...


[28-Apr-19 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I'll check their Twitter feed


[28-Apr-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Nada, niks, nothing, nichts, rien, nincsen


[28-Apr-19 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <domato> Niente


[28-Apr-19 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Oink Well, people can use STEX.


[28-Apr-19 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <domato> good night all !


[28-Apr-19 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Evening.


[28-Apr-19 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Indeed, we can, Crupti. Too bad for the coins I have tied up in DP now...


[28-Apr-19 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <kingcolex> Stex has kyc?


[28-Apr-19 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <kingcolex> No thanks


[28-Apr-19 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <kingcolex> Anyone want to buy 270 vrsc?


[28-Apr-19 02:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> Stex only has KYC if you want to trade FIAT


[28-Apr-19 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> wtFUD...


[28-Apr-19 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> People that mistake me for him, without any verification, I don't even WANT to trade with


[28-Apr-19 02:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Now you mention it, no, I'm not


[28-Apr-19 02:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I hate people abusing my Nick


[28-Apr-19 02:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <kingcolex> Yeah I had PM's with him still, looks like it's not you. Sorry for the bad luck of him using that name


[28-Apr-19 02:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> It's OK


[28-Apr-19 02:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> maybe it's wise not to accuse someone before verifying it's the right person.


[28-Apr-19 02:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I would appreciate if you removed a couple of lines up there, @kingcolex


[28-Apr-19 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <kingcolex> Done


[28-Apr-19 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> thanks @kingcolex


[28-Apr-19 02:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <kingcolex> Well thoskk I figured since it's a coin that he most likely mines and that's not a common name he might be here trying to  scheme


[28-Apr-19 02:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> TY very much


[28-Apr-19 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> Oink is here longer than me @kingcolex , and he's one of the most trustworthy persons in this discord I know.


[28-Apr-19 02:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Besides that, if I commit a crime it must be worth billions, enough to live the rest of my life in wealth on an üå¥


[28-Apr-19 02:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> on a palm tree?


[28-Apr-19 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yup... a treehouse with a hammock on a private deserted remote island


[28-Apr-19 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But I couldn‚Äôt find an emoticon for that


[28-Apr-19 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> you'd need two for it to work...  üå¥   üå¥  üòÑ


[28-Apr-19 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I hate work...


[28-Apr-19 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> You know... I was wondering if oink was oink


[28-Apr-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I was, am and will always remain Oink


[28-Apr-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I should have trademarked the name 30 years ago....

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> TY!


[29-Apr-19 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> And my (mini) order is placed


[29-Apr-19 04:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> mine too


[29-Apr-19 05:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Great comment about the FPGA bracket, by the way


[29-Apr-19 06:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> well, someone will be unpleasantly surprised


[29-Apr-19 06:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Only reason I can think of, is with a bracket the power connector is unusable...


[29-Apr-19 06:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paia> I am so happy, that I did not preorder, this poor design is a "no go" for me.


[29-Apr-19 06:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I did order, but I wish I hadn‚Äôt. Refund no option, cuz they don‚Äôt refund full BTC, just present value.


[29-Apr-19 08:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I think it's pretty shitty that Verus basically shafted a company and users with a working product to give a lot of free publicity to a company which does not. I hope they don't get the bounty.


[29-Apr-19 08:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> If they release the bitstream as open source, I don't see how the foundation can deny them the bounty


[29-Apr-19 08:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But I agree on the free publicity part


[29-Apr-19 08:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I don't think Verus shafted the company and users, but the company shafted Verus and its users...


[29-Apr-19 08:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I realize a deal is a deal


[29-Apr-19 08:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Well, for me it was a risk ordering, just got to deal with it.


[29-Apr-19 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> @Patrick Crypto Which company & users?


[29-Apr-19 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> I think shafted is the wrong term for what is implied


[29-Apr-19 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Verus forked to kick out an existing fpga. I thought it was reactionary and seems as though it just resulted in cpu farms taking over


[29-Apr-19 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> It was not the aim to "kick" them out. The goal was to even the hashrate between FPGA / GPU / CPU


[29-Apr-19 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I am probably irrationally annoyed by it all


[29-Apr-19 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Are you saying it wasn't reactionary?
 @Patrick Crypto


[29-Apr-19 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I'm stuck on my ass with a broken foot and annoyed with things I shouldn't even care about. Hopefully price or my staking rebounds soon


[29-Apr-19 08:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Gotcha


[29-Apr-19 08:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Get better


[29-Apr-19 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> IMO if Verus hadn‚Äôt forked and put a bounty out, we would be in a worse situation: hidden FPGA‚Äôs in big farms earning bulks of VRSC, mining centralized at said farms and people without the capitol to invest in overpriced expensive FPGA‚Äôs bailing. Now CPU mining is profitable (depending on energy prices) and the hashpower is more decentralized. Affordable FPGA‚Äôs with competitive MH/W ratios can stimulate decentralization.


[29-Apr-19 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Patrick Crypto get well soon


[29-Apr-19 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> I don't see the price increasing really for the foreseeable future...


[29-Apr-19 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Not with mining pools that pay out in btc


[29-Apr-19 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> @Patrick Crypto I just don't


[29-Apr-19 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I‚Äôm mining at one such pool with my GPUs , but get payed in VRSC...üòÅ


[29-Apr-19 08:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Price increase requires new btc


[29-Apr-19 08:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> New community members


[29-Apr-19 08:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> More buying than selling


[29-Apr-19 08:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> The thing with verus is it has natural growth (Be it slower than your usual 10000000% pumps on crap coins) it is natural and healthy


[29-Apr-19 08:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Current price is only interesting in two respects:

Heres another one to keep in mind as a Community Project!-

Reed's Law: "The Value of a Network Increases Dramatically When People Form Subgroups for Collaborations and Sharing"
In 1993, Robert Metcalfe noticed that the value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of users of the system. For example, two people with telephones can only make one connection. Five telephones can make 10 connections, and twelve telephones can make 66 connections. This is now famously known as "Metcalfe's Law" or network effect: The value of a network is proportional to n2, where n is the number of users.

[29-Apr-19 06:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @TheBitcoins The whitepaper is a good place to get an idea but Verus is no one trick pony and so like in most cases, complex systems require complex explanations. Right now Verus is focused on PBaaS (Public Blockchain as a Service), basically it's a system for developers or project creators to easily start up blockchain projects in just a few clicks. Projects created this way will be fully secure against attack and endowed with all of the technical capabilities of the parent chain (Verus). In conjunction with this already major achievement, Verus is now capable (in testnet for now) of merge mining (mining up to 15 projects all at the same time with the same hardware you already have and at no additional energy expenditure).
This is now but they also aim to tackle the deep seated flaws in the voting/polling and identity sectors. I'm sure if you stick around here a while you'll start to wonder what it might be that Verus CAN'T do. üòâ

[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> @TheBitcoins In the dev work? Contact the team. Else you can check active #active-bounties or #10k-bounty-submissions. Maybe make something or help out to get noticed. You can also go through the github and submit change suggestions if there‚Äôs anything that might be an improvement.

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Cool, I wrote a few of them publications to let them know it's worth looking at a younger and smaller project that's doing big things, bigger than most of the "big" ones and Hacker Noon got back to me saying they'd publish the Verus article starting "from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM (GMT+2) everyday" if I understand correctly. ü§ò

[dscrdvrsc] <J Oliver Westbrook> Marketing is an area that needs as much help as possible.


[01-May-19 10:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @TheBitcoins Verus is a community project. There are some large holders of coins, but all holders of coins mined and staked the coins like everyone else. The Verus Coin Foundation is one fairly large holder of coins with a long term goal of realizing the Verus vision expressed in the vision paper and beyond. It currently uses its coins to support people and efforts contributing to realizing the Verus Vision. Other large holders of coins may also choose to offer bounties, and @jl777c has in the past offered bounties for GPU development. As @J Oliver Westbrook said, the community and the Verus Coin Foundation believes the project could use help in marketing and outreach, web development, and core development as well. Feel free to talk about things here or ping me in DM to discuss further.

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Guys, thank you for letting the community know about these security issues with other coins,, but unless I'm missing something, and it's relevant to Verus now, can we put those in #off-topic or at least discuss why it is a general discussion topic for Verus? there will never be a shortage of security issues when considering all projects. regarding Duke's statement that Zcash has a DoS vulnerability that he knows how to exploit, but will work on privately if they don't offer a bounty, I only hope and assume that as a Komodo developer, if he knows of something that projects in the Komodo ecosystem are vulnerable to, Komodo would share such a vulnerability with the projects that derive from and have supported them. In any case, we often do our own security analyses, and while we do share any relevant results and ideas to solve them with Komodo and others, we will do more before PBaaS is released. One nice advance related to security in PBaaS is that it already includes header proofs of PoS blocks, which is a new industry-leading solution to the fake stake attacks that cuts them off at the header, before blocks are even considered.


[01-May-19 06:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> Sure, also thought about putting it in #off-topic  first, just wasn't sure if anybody here would be affected,  and off-topic might not have that impact, so ... you know? But will move that there, no problem.

[02-May-19 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> Not sure if "inter-chain meta contract" is synonymous with CC or not? r they the same thing @miketout ?, thanks


[02-May-19 03:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @gigamesh @Oink actually, interchain meta contracts was a reference to the evolution of ccs, so basically yes. Timelocks were implemented before ccs, so they are using bitcoin script style locks, though I believe @jl777c has done some very interesting things with time locked ccs more recently. The challenge in describing the cc technology is that it can be used to actually change consensus rules, which goes beyond smart contracts. add to that the ability to have cross-chain transactions, and it is really something beyond smart contracts as people know them today

[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> thx @miketout


[02-May-19 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> these CC smart contracts are UTXO right? I know ETH introduced the Balance model to deal with all the issues (none of which i know about) re running SC's over UTXO. SO how has KMD/VRSC solved these problems, and what were the problems ETH's balance model fixed?


[02-May-19 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> my only guess is unpredictable tx fees from sends with many inputs


[02-May-19 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <aikida3k> So mining this coin is mainly for newer CPUs.  I took a look at the spreadsheet and didn't see any of the Xeon X series CPUs benchmarked that you can buy in  refurbished servers.  I tried a dual processor hex core Xeon X5680 at 3.3 GHz.  At 2 threads per each core, mining with 24 total threads, it underperformed AWS instance Xeon Platinum 8175Ms at 2.5 GHz and Xeon E5-2686 at 2.3 GHz.  The AWS instances do about 2 MH/s with 4 threads; the X5680 does about 750 KH/s on 24 threads.


[06-May-19 10:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> interesting https://www.apnews.com/7e78189c21ce4a7cb7cb73432705c3ca
This is why when I spoke with Josh Beneloh about Verus, his fundamental issue was that we were using a public blockchain, which boiled down to him wanting a central authority to control vs. decentralized in my understanding. The big difference here is that, but if you believe in centralization, I suspect they have a solution in that context that is better that what people use today for elections. IMO, we should use this news to start a conversation, especially as PBaaS is entering testing. Thoughts?

[06-May-19 11:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> IMO this is Microsofts strategy trying to get into a new global market using their giant marketing machine, before any other entity get the chance to establish a customer base in those markets.


[07-May-19 12:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Think so too  @Oink. Luckily, for all Microsoft's pull, I  like to think that won't be enough to counteract public opinion or natural selection when Verus rolls out a superior option that is for/by the people


[07-May-19 12:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Working on a Tweet now... counteract the MS view and hitching a ride  on their twitter feed for maximum exposure...üòá


[07-May-19 12:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I had actually spoken to the person probably most technically involved from Microsoft, Josh Beneloh, when we were writing the proof of power paper. Generally, I believe this validates the importance of these applications for people and when it is available, which it isn't yet, will offer a set of open-source tools for development that can be used to make and run non-blockchain, centralized elections that employ zero knowledge privacy in some way and are auditable cryptographically. I think in this case, we need to consider that decentralized public polling and elections is one of the important applications we want to enable with PBaaS, and not only does Verus have technology to make that capability confidential, verifiable, and transparent, it will be available to everyone with Verus to use and secured by the voters themselves, which is why that is part of our vision. I think the best outcome would really be to start a real discussion about centralized, expensive solutions vs. decentralized solutions by and for the people.


[07-May-19 12:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I am going to quote this!


[07-May-19 12:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> maybe how it is now üòÉ, or now üòâ


[07-May-19 12:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I think the focus on public versus centralized and community vs commercially developed are the main discussion points. Not to mention that apparently (IMO) MS considers PBaaS enough of a competitor to make press releases about their system... Which is basically a compliment to the work done here.


[07-May-19 01:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I wouldn't credit their concern as the reason. they usually do things for different reasons. in this case, i honestly think it's part of being connected to the DARPA contract work through their research group


[07-May-19 01:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I agree on that, but in order to get a public discussion about it outside our discord, I will put that consideration in the tweet.


[07-May-19 01:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Crazy that DARPA is involved but then again it shows it's something the govt knows is important. Also makes me a bit weary or that after they wouldn't also want at least some element of control


[07-May-19 01:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Why would you trust a democratic tool, developed by a **Defense** Advanced Research Project Agency?


[07-May-19 01:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Since it's centralized, the public doesn't control it, therefore it cannot be considered a democratic tool in its core.


[07-May-19 01:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Exactly! ^^^


[07-May-19 01:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Oink Thanks for the enthusiasm üòÉ I wasn't raising questions about their intentions, and it is a bit awkward for me with my history to be lead dev and not speak up when the community starts saying they did it because of us. I don't believe that's true, as Josh was clearly involved in election cryptography before we spoke. We talked about that, and he probably said as much as he could without breaking an NDA. I didn't agree with him on everything, but I think his intentions were good. I was trying to be factual in my statement above, but it feels like it might be quoted a little more negative towards them than the disussion starter I meant. If we have Microsoft friendly people or ex-Microsoft friends who would be interested in the project partially due to me being lead dev, they are likely to also believe that this isn't a reaction to us or any kind of slight on PBaaS, and I suspect they'd be put off by a claim that Microsoft is reacting to PBaaS. I believe it is likely they will react to us at some point, but I don't think this is that. Going to sleep. I would feel better if we could find a more positive way to start the discussion, so it isn't cut off early.


[07-May-19 02:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I get your point. I don't doubt they have the best intentions and I admit that I'm not overly positive towards Microsoft and DARPA (I actually tuned down my initial draft quit a bit). I don't mean to damage any relations, of any kind, so I removed the tweets and am rewriting them


[07-May-19 04:41 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I want to share some thoughts around voting, Microsoft's recent announcement of its importance to them, and perspective on what I understand to be their general approach. Also, as far as Verus is concerned, the voting is part of the vision of PBaaS powered public services, including polls and voting by and for the people. Many contributors in the community, including me, believe that the "by and for the people" is .an essential part of the credibility of a process. It is already clear that PBaaS, especially with reserve currency conversion, will enable many applications that can provide opportunity to a great number of people, organizations, and businesses across many sectors. There are people already working towards using PBaaS for some very exciting business opportunities, but we do not waver on the idea that the vision for polls and elections, decentralized ID and eventually machine learning applied to the data on behalf of the public, are central to Verus' future. That it is important enough for Microsoft to invest as well is validation that we are working towards an important vision, more than it is anything to fear as competition. IMO, it's good if they can improve election integrity, even as we disrupt the entire process over time.

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I want in no case put the foundation in danger by making presumptions


[07-May-19 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I also want to share some information that I learned from Josh Beneloh when we spoke about blockchain and voting during his review of the Proof of Power paper. First, he stated off the bat that he didn't agree with blockchains being useful for voting, and when we spoke about reasons, I understood the following arguments from his perspective:
1. Proof of work can be 51% attacked, so there is simply a price for getting control of which votes get processed and which don't
2. Blockchains don't provide any significant value to the process, and for that reason, shouldn't be part of the solution. This led to probably the most fundamental issue over which we didn't not agree.
3. Centralization is not a bad thing and prevents coercion from parties that would unduly influence voters in a way that couldn't be policed
We also spoke in detail about confidential, verifiable, and transparent elections, and although I don't know that Microsoft would have done what they did in response to us, it is quite clear that the people involved had in-depth discussion and access to our vision for some time. When we spoke, Josh had already been working on election cryptography for some time, and he described the model that he believed would work to ensure confidentiality, verifiability, and transparence.


[07-May-19 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> I¬¥m worried that too much voting power will be given to large holders of Verus, should be some kind of cap to how many votes you have - probably impossible to prevent ppl hiding their true voting power by just spreading their funds over multiple accounts, though.


[07-May-19 03:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Obviously, with Verus Proof of Power, which was the paper he was reviewing, we were able to set aside #1, since the algorithm ensures that the blockchain is not subject to 51% hash attacks, even before we get to dPoW. #2 was a more fundamental disagreement.


[07-May-19 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Crupti I'll continue on this thread first, but as a brief answer, each vote/poll would run on its own PBaaS chain, and voting power would be part of the initial authorization. In actual elections, every participant would have the same voting power, and with notarization, a 51% attack could be argued to be basically winning the election, though that is a little tongue in cheek, it conveys the fact that any attack would be the voters attacking themselves.


[07-May-19 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> As stated in the  Universal Declaration of Human Rights...


[07-May-19 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> We discussed reasons that he believed centralization was better than blockchains and algorithms that enabled decentralization, and from my perspective, it boiled down to trust in a central managing authority vs. the assumption that you can eliminate that trust. I don't believe we would get over that in the near term with any number of hours of conversation.


[07-May-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> He also felt that if people could vote in private and did not have to go to designated polling places, which of course is not dictated by the ability to vote using Verus, coercion by corrupt parties would be easier. I don't actually agree with that, but it was part of the discussion. Along those lines, he felt that any decentralized approach would not have the oversight needed to ensure that there wasn't coercion. Again, we don't see eye to eye on the potential for institutional coercion and the risk that decentralization may pose vs. mitigation of the total risk.


[07-May-19 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> He said that the voting model he believed would be best to preserve the CVT properties that we outlined in the vision paper was the following, in terms of work flow:
1. A person receives their voters information and authorization to vote at a voting center and casts a vote.
2. When they cast a vote, they are given a receipt that shows that they voted and that can be located in some available data of the votes.
3. If they want to verify that their vote was registered correctly, they must invalidate their vote and will then see that it was in fact the vote they cast
4. They can invalidate and revote as many times as they like until the end of voting


[07-May-19 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> There are a lot of reasons this is better than what the public uses for voting today, but it does require trust of the managing authority at all times. Josh would probably disagree and say that the cryptography can always be used to validate that everyone did what they should have. In fact, the managing, tracking, and long term public preservation of all of the data is one of the benefits of blockchain that is actually missing in that model and dependent on the managing authority to accurately provide.


[07-May-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> For example, many actual elections involved people standing in lines for hours to vote. If that happens, I don't think people will trash their vote to be sure it worked only to get another. At the same time, what about all the votes that come in near the end, when people really don't have the time to trash the vote and try again? What about changes at critical times to the data, or trusting a specific provider as the accurate source of data vs. a public blockchain that everyone shares? I believe that technically, all of these problems are arguably solvable without blockchain, but without a broadly shared, maintained, confirmed, and preserved trustless database, every one of those steps requires trust.


[07-May-19 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I suspect that Josh Beneloh is reasoning from a Western Society point of view.
- Not everybody that is entitled to vote has access to the electronic means to vote in private, so the coercion argument flies out the Windows.
- People in (formerly) unstable regions of the world will be suspicious of any form of governmental/commercial involvement. Even governments don't trust big companies, when they originate from a (in their eyes) hostile nation. (e.g. Huawei & 5G networks)
- An invalidate/recast voting system may cause extra stress on the voting system. If done on a large scale, elections could be influenced by crashing the entire system.
- If a vote can be invalidated, that means that is a possible attack vector for parties trying to influence the elections.


[07-May-19 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I fully agree on your last paragraph, Mike


[07-May-19 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Large corporations are psycopatic by nature and will always seek centralization (control) imo.


[07-May-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Whilst decentralized solutions are for the people and by the people. I believe that in general, asking someone that works at one of the worlds largest corporations will hardly yield an objective answer about decentralization .


[07-May-19 03:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I am only going by our conversation of some months ago, which was in depth and included a lot of discussion of the above points. I don't know for sure that this is the model they will release when the tools are available, but it's likely a reasonable bet.


[07-May-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> And you are still of the opinion that it is a better solution than the existing voting system? To be honest, I disagree on that. I see too many vulnerabilities in the model.


[07-May-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I will say that it is better than many systems.


[07-May-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> What I can't wrap my head around is: How can anybody in the light of the past unveilings of manipulations of elections and other major decisions still believe that a centralised system is the better solution? Centralisation is always a greater risk for manipulation than a widespread decentralised one.


[07-May-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Although Microsoft and DARPA are developing an open source voting system, I still have to trust that it is also used in the voting system. In a centralized system I just have to rely on that, as in a decentralized system I can simply find out by joining in the chain and running the source code myself.


[07-May-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> The idea of vote transparency is a strength with PBaaS, tamper proof elections where no one can afterwards claim they won even though they did not - and the voters ability to * at any point in time * being able to validate their cast vote with the blockchain. If it is centralized the blockchain can be deleted after the election to hide the results, any excuse can be given for the deletion, they could blaim "hackers" or "terrorists" for the corrupted or deleted blockchain.


[07-May-19 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> And on a more personal note: Why would I trust Microsoft to not retrieve my identity and voting conduct? If I see the amount of data windows is already collecting and reporting to Microsoft, I get trust issues in that respect.


[07-May-19 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But that basically goes for every reasonably sized company I know


[07-May-19 04:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Oink Excellent point, a vote should always be tied to a digital signature which can not be directly connected to the voter¬¥s true identity - unless you give your permission. If the blockchain is centralized then at least voter IP¬¥s can be tracked as the nodes could potentially all be located inside a datacenters where all network traffic is being logged. With a decentralized blockchain voter IP¬¥s will be untracable since the blockchain nodes are located all over the world.


[07-May-19 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> But what I think may be a major issue in the future is: Accepting a decentralised voting system would demand couraged leaders, and as we know, most (political) leaders are anything else but couraged. So they will decide to rather accept a centralised system prone to manipulation, but under their control, than a decentralised one they can't control. Because all they want _is_ control. Which also implies that voting will never be truely anonymous, although it is claimed to be or even stated in many countries' constitutions.


[07-May-19 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I think the answer to that, @Thoskk is starting with small insignificant elections (clubs electing their president) proving to the administration that the system works and gradually work our way up the chain. (pun intended).
Ofcoarse I would like to see the next presidential election in the USA running on PBaaS, but I don't think it's feasable.


[07-May-19 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> I think I can predict that we won't see blockchain-based political elections in any industrial country within the next 10 or 15 years, whether decentralised or not. But that's not even the point. Because this kind of election system would break with traditions, it's new, few people understand what it is, most haven't even heard about. And it's a long, long way to go until it may be accepted in a smaller country, but in the bigger ones ... I can't see that right now. 
If elections should ever be based on blockchain technology, I think it would be first in countries like Estland or similar, smaller, but technologically advanced ones.


[07-May-19 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> PBaaS enable voter privacy, transparency, and election audit. Also, there should be no possible way of  deleting the blockchain once it has gone live in an attempt to rewrite history after the fact.


[07-May-19 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> The fact that something much better exists sadly doesn't mean it will be used. History tells a lot of stories about that.

[07-May-19 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> Just looking at the electorial system in the US, which in my opinion is neither democratic nor fair, and could have been changed ages ago - it hasn't. So why change to something even more hocus-pocus new stuff?


[07-May-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Unfortunately, however grim your prediction is, I tend to agree that countries that have an acceptable system in place will be hesitant to try something new. The blockchain technology is a misunderstood and underappreciated tool at the moment. I see however great potential for countries that are struggling with democracy and still working their way into trusting democracy.
Imagine the people walking for a day, to stand in line for hours to cast their vote, to find out afterwards that the election was rigged. Now you can use a larger voting window than usual and visit all the remote places with mobile infrastructure and let people vote in their vicinity. At the same time the people that go to the voting stations have a larger voting window, so the queues will be smaller, if any. Added bonus is that if you want to intimidate people at the voting stations you'll have to keep them for much longer in order to get the effect you intend.


[07-May-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Without PBaaS privacy, voter transparency, and audit, there is no definitive way for a voter to verify that their vote was accurately recorded and stored, and that their true identity was protected.


[07-May-19 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Maybe somebody else developes a dedicated voting system with the same options PBaaS has, but AFAIK PBaaS is the only technology that has these features built in.


[07-May-19 04:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> With a centralized blockchain, however, your IP-address could potentially be recorded and stored without your concent, and voter transparency and election audit would be impossible if the blockchain was deleted after the election was over. There are elections where multiple sides claim victory all the time.


[07-May-19 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> don't get me wrong, I think blockchain and e.g. voting via PBaaS is one of the greatest developments I've recently seen. Just, acceptance in public and in politics is quite a different thing, and demagogues are more popular than rationalists.


[07-May-19 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Maybe blockchain based, but not with the full set of capabilities PBaaS has, but only a subset, just to make safe voting possible.... But then again, why strip it down if the tool here?


[07-May-19 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> and we'll need a long breath until we see it implemented.


[07-May-19 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> In the end all technology will grow to be outdated and will be surpassed by newer technology based on different points of view.


[07-May-19 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I can only hope we see global implementation before that happens


[07-May-19 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> it's comparable to catholic church permitting women to be priests.

[07-May-19 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> a system based on control will be somewhat reluctant to give control away.

[07-May-19 04:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> but we'll see what will happen when knowledge about this "new" technology will eventually spread and be present in everydays life.


[07-May-19 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I imagine it will attract people that are in powerless situations... That's why I think that PBaaS elections will first be implemented in the 'troubled' parts of our world.


[07-May-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763

[07-May-19 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> although people and governments will stand on opposite sides looking at this. Grassroots are one thing, but legislation and executive are in other hands.


[07-May-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> All history books should be written on public blockchains, then no despot will ever again have the possibility to rewrite history - imagine if all the books in Alexandria was on a public blockchain üòÉ then the Romans would not have been able to burn it down.


[07-May-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> True. Which is why I think it's a good idea to start PBaaS elections in smal, non-governmental bodies

[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> I think, integrating blockchain into "normal" life first is the best way to make it accepted. Which will inevitably be as apps on mobile devices for payments and other, similar actions of "safe" data transfer.

[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> besides it's actually quite cool that they seemingly have a 'fund' for user losses, the existence of that fund justifies giving your money to some other exchanges, if binance was able to collect some of it to put it into a fund, they have more than enough already üòÉ


[07-May-19 11:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> just sayin' üòÉ


[08-May-19 12:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You always know how to lighten the mood...


[08-May-19 12:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> dont say the thought isnt plausible at least! üòÑ


[08-May-19 02:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Not even just plausible, also very likely...


[08-May-19 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> would you rather not have the fund and your coins lost?


[08-May-19 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> I think it's wise to have it, and I appreciate the transparency.


[08-May-19 02:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i generally would rather encourage people not to park their money at exchanges.


[08-May-19 02:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> that is relative. Sometime it takes a few days for a trade to get accomplished. Prices are rarely exactly at the level you would like to have them when you log in.


[08-May-19 02:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Some people keep their coins on an exchange because it also stakes the coins for them... plain lazyness


[08-May-19 02:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> and a few days may also become a few weeks. Yo wouldn't withdraw your coins during that time because you'd loose quite a bit for tx fees.


[08-May-19 02:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> on top of that you'd not be able to quickly respond when prices are changing. Good deals are also a matter of patience.


[08-May-19 02:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> so, it's easy to advise not to stash coins on an exchange, but reality looks different.


[08-May-19 02:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> yes. üòÉ


[08-May-19 02:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> let me refine the statement: "Don't leave your assets sitting at an exchange unnecessarily".


[08-May-19 02:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> you cant give off control over your money (because that is what you actually do when you park it at an exchange) and expect me not to make fun about people that are actually doing it


[08-May-19 02:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i am sorry, but you just cannot expect that.


[08-May-19 03:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> most of you guys don't trust well-established banks. but then easily trust a (mostly foreign) exchange with your money.


[08-May-19 03:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> ü§£


[08-May-19 03:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i'm not saying you should trust banks, just to make sure tho


[08-May-19 03:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and then another cryptopia, binance or what not gets cracked open


[08-May-19 03:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> and i am not allowed to joke about it


[08-May-19 03:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> that is not fair


[08-May-19 03:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> sure, go ahead. However, it's like an advise not to move your car through a city with heavy traffic or park in a public parking lot close to the street. You also can make fun of people doing it anyway, I just don't think it helps a lot üòâ


[08-May-19 03:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> oh well.


[08-May-19 03:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> just don't take that personal, I was referring to it in a more general way.


[08-May-19 03:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> If you're not prepared to take the risk that you're car gets damaged, it's actually sound advice


[08-May-19 03:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i'm not taking it personal. it's just that the very core reason that cracked open exchanges are always such a huge problem just stems from the fact that people put more money into exchanges than they should, were they reasonable human beings.


[08-May-19 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> true


[08-May-19 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> If I had a new Ferrari, I probably wouldn't take it into a busy city and park it on the street...


[08-May-19 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> well if i posess anything that i dont want to lose, i'll treat it with care


[08-May-19 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> if you live e.g. in Hong Kong, you'd have no choice. @Oink


[08-May-19 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> that is some understanding that seemingly is lost with nowadays mankind


[08-May-19 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> It's all about being aware of the risks and the willingness to accept the risk and the consequences.


[08-May-19 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> And if I was living on the moon I would worry more about micro-meteorites.


[08-May-19 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> now wait a second. an IT security breach isnt like a micro-meteorite on moon, watched from earth


[08-May-19 03:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> yes, that's the point: Be aware of the risks, and do what's necessary to minimize them.


[08-May-19 03:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> just sayin'


[08-May-19 03:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> so, with the staking exchange


[08-May-19 03:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i remember one in particular where there were issues for quite a long time where nobody knew about any official statement relating to these issues, from said exchange.


[08-May-19 03:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> go on to explain me how this is a good idea to participate in


[08-May-19 05:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> As far as I can see, it's ready. Just need some extra eyes to scout for issues I may have overlooked:

[08-May-19 06:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Oink Very nice üòÉ Description text is very small on my 15" screen, though. I can hardly read it. I also tried to click the icons before the button below, many may do the same.


[08-May-19 06:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> If you point at the links, the desription will also pop up..


[08-May-19 06:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Icons are not clickable (yet)


[08-May-19 06:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Oink Not very intuitive imo üòÑ


[08-May-19 06:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> possibly some sort of seperator between the Video / Text / Social Media sections?


[08-May-19 06:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Ginasis Mining Pools already working on it


[08-May-19 06:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> üòÉ


[08-May-19 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> also possibly ```Links to external sources from various media
No matter who produced the information or what the content is, here we've accumulated links to the information that is available.```


[08-May-19 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Been reverting back every time because it looks horrible...


[08-May-19 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> center that?


[08-May-19 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yep, good one!


[08-May-19 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> even if the separator is just a couple extra spaces maybe


[08-May-19 06:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I'v been trying to break the big white background, without being too intrusive.....


[08-May-19 06:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> also my pet peeve of the site currently is that "Explorer" opens in a new window... Not sure what others think...


[08-May-19 06:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> that and blog


[08-May-19 06:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> 0.6em font size is not very readable for anyone on a 15" screen, and there are plenty of people on even smaller 13" screens which will have the same responsive layout as the 15" screens.


[08-May-19 06:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> 0.9em looks ok for that font, tried it now.


[08-May-19 06:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Any link that is not on the actual page, breaks out into a new tab. If the explorer was in the same layout I would leave it in the same tab


[08-May-19 06:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> fair


[08-May-19 06:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Oink  just add a text-align: center to p.checksum and set font-size: 0.9em and it looks a lot better


[08-May-19 06:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I'll have a go with your suggestions!


[08-May-19 06:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> so you can just skip that


[08-May-19 06:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> [DELETED] üòÑ


[08-May-19 06:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I already wrote it down,...üòÜ


[08-May-19 06:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Oink  I don¬¥t think text-overflow: elipsis works without white-space: nowrap, and you don¬¥t want only a single line of description.


[08-May-19 06:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I was just about to removethe nowrap...


[08-May-19 06:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> @Oink What do you think about sorting that stuff into columns? Some extra work, I know ...


[08-May-19 06:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> As in opposed to sorting into rows, like now?


[08-May-19 06:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> yes


[08-May-19 06:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> What I think you say is: Put the description in a header on top of the links, not to the left as it is right now.
Is that correct?


[08-May-19 06:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> excatly, that's what I mean


[08-May-19 06:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That would mean I have to do the wallet and miner download pages too, to keep a consistent look all over the site


[08-May-19 06:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> just if you feel like üòâ


[08-May-19 06:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Not really, no....


[08-May-19 06:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> üòÑ


[08-May-19 06:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Maybe in a future update... I would like to replace the current site ASAP.


[08-May-19 06:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> I mean, other pages are already kind of column style, you wouldn't have to change them I think


[08-May-19 06:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> but do as you feel üòâ


[08-May-19 06:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> This page is basically a copy of the other pages, with the content replaced, so yes, I would have to do them too


[08-May-19 06:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <The Doctor> ok


[08-May-19 06:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> First the more important matters: spacing, clickable icons and readable descriptions


[08-May-19 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> I would suggest at least fixing this ‚Äò‚Äô‚ÄôRead an watch about VRSC now!‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô


[08-May-19 08:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> To read ‚Äúand‚Äù


[08-May-19 08:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> Although ultimately it‚Äôs not a good sentence to start with.


[08-May-19 08:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> Something like ‚ÄúLearn more about Verus by watching these videos!‚Äù


[08-May-19 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Crupti No enlargement of the font. It throws the entire page off balance, unless I enlarge all fonts. But that will result in a grotesque page. I did ditch the word wrap.
@Ginasis Mining Pools Spacing between categories implemented, for consistency applied that to other pages too.


[08-May-19 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Cam [Trivia Challenge!] Thank you. Those suggestions are exactly the sort of things a non-native speaker is looking for.


[08-May-19 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cam [Trivia Challenge!]> I‚Äôll look at it some more on my computer in a bit. On mobile right now


[08-May-19 08:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I'm not going anywhere...


[08-May-19 09:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> how big is the native wallet?


[08-May-19 10:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> About blockchain + zcash params together about 5GB


[08-May-19 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> does it save the blockchain data to appdata or programdata?


[08-May-19 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> or can it be moved elsewhere


[08-May-19 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> App data


[08-May-19 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Cannot be moved.


[08-May-19 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> yeah not worth it


[08-May-19 10:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> would be nice if you could save it to external storage or another drive


[08-May-19 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> 5gb is a lot?


[08-May-19 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> on a ssd yes


[08-May-19 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Indeed, it would... it‚Äôs worth a suggestion to our Agama developer...


[08-May-19 10:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> i have bitcoin core on external and its about 250GB


[08-May-19 10:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Ordered 1TB Nvme to stay out of trouble... waiting for it to arrive...


[08-May-19 10:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> i am probably going to get 2 500GB ssd's and a raid card and set them to raid 0


[08-May-19 10:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> a lot cheaper then nvme storage


[08-May-19 10:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Ehmmm... not a big fan of striping...


[08-May-19 10:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> In my main I have 4tb of ssd storage


[08-May-19 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> I havent used hhds in a while


[08-May-19 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> i have ~ 500GB ssd storage then about 12TB of external storage


[08-May-19 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> redundant storage


[08-May-19 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> you can get a 1tb ssd now for $100


[08-May-19 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> so how is 5gb a lot? lol


[08-May-19 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> love windows storage spaces


[08-May-19 10:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> Games > Blockchain data üòâ


[08-May-19 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> who saves games locally? ha


[08-May-19 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> i do for the speeds


[08-May-19 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> I just download them as needed.  Maybe keep a few local that I play more often


[08-May-19 10:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> Crypto >>>>>>>>> games


[08-May-19 10:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> but yeah it would be nice if the blockchain could be stored externally but i can always  create a symlink to fake it


[08-May-19 10:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> whoops off topic


[08-May-19 10:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> its general discussion


[08-May-19 10:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> I meant me.  I get rolling on something and clog things up


[08-May-19 10:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> I *try* to leave this stictly verus in here


[08-May-19 10:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> i think thats what i will do just download the wallet then symlink it to external anyways


[08-May-19 10:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> whos the agama developer?


[08-May-19 10:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Mike tout jr


[08-May-19 10:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Well the Komodo team and verus forked and now maintain their own version üòÉ


[08-May-19 10:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Wait... so wallet data on main drive is bad and games on main drive is good? Have I been doing it wrong for the past decade or more?


[08-May-19 10:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @zpajk wallet data is better stored on a secure offline if possible device


[08-May-19 10:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Only connecting to a more secure machine when you need to use


[08-May-19 10:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Well that‚Äôs my opinion


[08-May-19 10:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I didn‚Äôt dare any sensible comments after he mentioned raid-0


[08-May-19 10:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> üòõ

[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> you dont need blockchain data to secure your actual wallet the dat file is actually your wallet üòõ


[08-May-19 11:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> that's why a lot of people grab the bootstrap to save time


[08-May-19 11:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> verus though is probably different


[08-May-19 11:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You don‚Äôt need blockchain to secure, only to access...

[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> i meant bootstrap

[08-May-19 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> is your actual wallet


[08-May-19 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> %appdata%\Komodo\VRSC\blocks is the blockchain

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Your point being?


[08-May-19 11:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> i thought someone said you need blockchain to have your data secured which is not true just the wallet.dat

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But it‚Äôs been a bit quiet today here, all the action was in #off-topic , I suppose...


[09-May-19 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Hollowman9000 everything is good. I did have some not fun dental work the other day, but I've been 100% heads down on the next rev of PBaaS for testnet. except for that interruption, i've been hoping to get an update out for people with some cool new capabilities and improvements any day. as a meta goal, i'm really just focused on getting finished with the full PBaaS upgrade for mainnet, which includes PBaaS, merge mining, auto-notarization for cross chain transactions, and full fractional reserve liquidity support with a solution to front-running. As soon as I finish with the next PBaaS testnet upgrade, I'm going to go for finishing the whole thing with reserves and hardening. People across the community should discuss what PBaaS can actually do, and it would probably be best for the project during this stretch for more people to try it out, learn how it works, and share what it is. The last testnet has been a little taste, and we got good test value. This should be more fun, and I really hope people try it out by making their own blockchains, merge mining, and notarizing other chains even to get rewards. On the liquidity piece, which will be part of the protocol for fractional reserve chains, and will open up an incredible number of use cases, you can checkout an article I came across recently that explains it pretty well. Instead of tokens, it will be full coins on a blockchain of their own with Verus as the reserve. Instead of a fixed reserve percentage, reserves will be modifiable down through reward emission and up through staking of the blockchain reserves, which can also pay for services: https://hackernoon.com/how-liquid-tokens-work-a4ba30f2482b?fbclid=IwAR3_PkeD6bW8QEfQ4bQ1uqajWeJQOuoDE9iouSsckq9B8-tJ7Elz0wm27GA

[09-May-19 01:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That would mean that autochains will be able to influence their slippage, if they can vary the reserve...

[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Thanks for the update @miketout

[09-May-19 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> And soon anyone can easily create their own fully flexible projects. The process of blockchain creation finally automated.  That is the progress everyone, both inside and out of this project has been waiting for

[10-May-19 04:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Even if they have pinned it out the same as a 6 pin this will no doubt have very bad results as if someone less knowledgeable receives theirs then sees a 4 pin connector and puts one in....

[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @zpajk  the 6 pin will go in as the 4 pin has the square, the 6/8 pin has the corners cut so it will fit in


[10-May-19 06:02 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> And I¬¥ve been testing it since about December last year, so it works quite nicely now.


[10-May-19 11:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I‚Äôld love to see how it performs...


[10-May-19 11:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> On my Mac it does about the same as CCMiner, so no big surprises there.


[10-May-19 11:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Did you already compile for Linux or Windows?


[10-May-19 11:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> But I needed to learn how the algo work (and have some fun too üòÉ ..) so I did not just want to build on nheqminer of ccminer


[10-May-19 11:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Very nice


[10-May-19 11:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> We should move to #mining-dev by the way


[10-May-19 11:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> It compiles for Linux and Mac.


[10-May-19 11:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> kk, I¬¥ll continue in #mining-dev np


[10-May-19 11:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Hey way to go  @Crupti! From left field!  That's super exciting! Gonna toss my email on that list of yours now too! üëå üòÑ üëç

[10-May-19 06:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Just wanna give a shout out to @Crupti and @Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining for their unexpected kickass community development! Busy day it seems! üéâ Thanks! üòÅ


[10-May-19 06:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Its exciting to see people from all around coming together and contributing. With a solid development team and a passionate community working together, the sky isn't the limit! üöÄ


[10-May-19 06:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Sorry, didn't mean to get sappy. Got a tear in my eye. üòÇ 
It is reassuring though, that is the ideal goal for any community project


[10-May-19 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> As the great snowball rolls along, more and more jump in to help it grow and pretty soon it's the unstoppable Indiana Jones ball


[11-May-19 12:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <nille> good day


[11-May-19 01:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> hey everyone im new to Verus


[11-May-19 01:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> is anyone awake? lol


[11-May-19 01:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I'm sleeptyping..


[11-May-19 01:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i just downloaded the whole blockcain and started mining. im guessing the local mega hash is my speed?


[11-May-19 01:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> using the GUI


[11-May-19 01:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yes, it is. You are mining with the wallet?


[11-May-19 01:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> yes


[11-May-19 01:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You could also explore the option of using an external miner to do poolmining. That may get you started on gathering VRCS a bit quicker on the start


[11-May-19 02:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> im getting 18.008 on a ryzen 7 1800X using 12 threads


[11-May-19 02:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> will it change on the fly?


[11-May-19 02:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> or do i have to stop mining


[11-May-19 02:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yes, it will


[11-May-19 02:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> tryin 14 now


[11-May-19 02:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> what does the Start STaking button do?


[11-May-19 02:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> Staking*


[11-May-19 02:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> If you have coins, it will secure the chain. If you stake a block you get the same reward as you would mining a block


[11-May-19 02:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> so when should i click it


[11-May-19 02:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> The Verus chain is 50% PoW (mining) and 50% PoS (staking)


[11-May-19 02:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> what happens if i froget to click it


[11-May-19 02:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> No, just switch is on. Any addition to your balance will automatically stake once it's added after 150 blocks (about 2.5 hours)


[11-May-19 02:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> so witch it on in 2.5 hours?


[11-May-19 02:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> No, just switch in on. It'll stay on.


[11-May-19 02:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> speed is about 18.9 now


[11-May-19 02:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> 14 threads


[11-May-19 02:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> so because i started this in legacy mode. which wallet and i mining to right now?


[11-May-19 02:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> and how would i ge tthe seed information and stuff


[11-May-19 02:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> Native mode sorry


[11-May-19 02:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You are right now mining to your own wallet.


[11-May-19 02:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> so where do i see that info and the seed words for it?


[11-May-19 02:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i clicked on Settings


[11-May-19 02:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> TThe seed info is applicable to the light wallet. You'll need to backup your `priv key`


[11-May-19 02:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You'll need to go to **recieve**


[11-May-19 02:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You're addresses should be listed there.


[11-May-19 02:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> On the left hand side of the address is a button with three dots on top of eachother


[11-May-19 02:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> yes i got the address and private key saved


[11-May-19 02:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> but is ther eno seed word when using the wallet in native mode?


[11-May-19 02:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> if you click it it'll show a menu with `copy priv key (WIF)`. you should store that key in a safe place


[11-May-19 02:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> yessir already done


[11-May-19 02:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> The priv key is used as seed phrase...


[11-May-19 02:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> ok perfect


[11-May-19 02:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> nad i cant change the wallet name in Native mode right?


[11-May-19 02:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> and*


[11-May-19 02:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You can use it to add that address to another wallet, light or native


[11-May-19 02:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> right nows its just random numbers and letters


[11-May-19 02:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> No, cannot change the name


[11-May-19 02:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> ok and i did Encryp wallet seed


[11-May-19 02:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That's simply the fromat the address is in. Like on your bank account you cannot change the account number to something nice


[11-May-19 02:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i should delete the  other wallet i created in simple mode correct?


[11-May-19 02:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Did you have funds in the light wallet?


[11-May-19 02:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> no


[11-May-19 02:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You can do 2 things: 1) import the address in native using the seed you have or 2) forget about the light address


[11-May-19 02:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> It's not saved on your system.


[11-May-19 02:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i dleted it


[11-May-19 02:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> and encrypted the new one


[11-May-19 02:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> ok almost done lol


[11-May-19 02:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> the wallet.dat keys whjat is that


[11-May-19 02:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i just got 99 jeys lol


[11-May-19 02:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> keys


[11-May-19 02:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> The wallet.dat is your actual wallet. Make sure nobody else but you has access to it. If you want to backup your wallet, this is the file to backup


[11-May-19 02:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> sorry i mean the "wallet.day Keys"  option in the setting


[11-May-19 02:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i selected VRSC nd then click get keys


[11-May-19 02:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> says 99 found


[11-May-19 02:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> These are 'reserved' addresses for your wallet and their keys


[11-May-19 02:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> oh ok


[11-May-19 02:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> so i dont need to save those


[11-May-19 02:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> No, that's not necessary


[11-May-19 02:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> awesome


[11-May-19 02:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> so what directory is the blockchain and my wallet saved in?


[11-May-19 02:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Check the pinned message in #community-support  channel


[11-May-19 02:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> It also tells you how to backup, amongst other things


[11-May-19 02:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> ok found it


[11-May-19 02:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> wallet.dat  etc


[11-May-19 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> the blockchain is only 3.2 GB ?


[11-May-19 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yes, but of coarse it keeps growing


[11-May-19 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> yes


[11-May-19 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> what is this bootstrap thing for that i read in the pinned message. do i need it?


[11-May-19 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> If for any reason your blockchain gets corrupted (system crash or something) this is a fast way to download the chain.


[11-May-19 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> The bootstrap is created daily on the server by 0x03, one of our valued community members.


[11-May-19 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> oh i see


[11-May-19 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That‚Äôll save you a lengthy synchronization.


[11-May-19 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> so the few hours i just waited initially would have been faster? lol


[11-May-19 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yup... didn‚Äôt want to emphasize that... lol


[11-May-19 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> lmao


[11-May-19 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> no worries


[11-May-19 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> didnt take too long


[11-May-19 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i think 3 or 4 hours


[11-May-19 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That‚Äôs fast. Some folks reported over 24 hours...


[11-May-19 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> oh no def not that long


[11-May-19 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i would say 5 hours max


[11-May-19 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Greatly depends on cpu and internet connection speed


[11-May-19 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> yes for sure


[11-May-19 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> so now i just sit back and wait i guess


[11-May-19 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yup...


[11-May-19 02:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> speeds at 19.4 now with 14 threads


[11-May-19 02:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> With your speed expect on **average** 1 block mined per week.


[11-May-19 02:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> At the present network difficulty.


[11-May-19 02:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i guess thats ok


[11-May-19 02:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> and 1 block of VRSC is how many i seen it earlier but i forget


[11-May-19 02:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> 24 VRSC


[11-May-19 02:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> so just over 2 USD a block at the moment


[11-May-19 02:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> 2.12


[11-May-19 02:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yep, priced just dropped, but it‚Äôs pretty stable.


[11-May-19 02:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> nice


[11-May-19 02:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Just have a look around the other channels here. You‚Äôll notice some pretty awesome stuff being developed right now...


[11-May-19 02:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> ya i took a super quick looks when i frst lgged in


[11-May-19 02:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i will def research a lot more


[11-May-19 02:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> PBaaS being the major development at the moment...


[11-May-19 02:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> reading more on it now


[11-May-19 02:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> Verus is CPU only right?


[11-May-19 02:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Mainly... there‚Äôs much work done on gpu mining and we do have FPGA‚Äôs on the network


[11-May-19 02:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But the FPGA‚Äôs don‚Äôt outperform the newest CPU‚Äôs by much


[11-May-19 02:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i prefer cpu anyways


[11-May-19 02:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> less electrcity as well


[11-May-19 02:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Most people have one... üòÇ


[11-May-19 02:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> lol ya


[11-May-19 02:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i have a 580x gpu as well but rather use my cpu


[11-May-19 02:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> F1 mini actually performs at about 1MH/W, which is pretty good...

[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> whats an F1 mini?


[11-May-19 02:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Nvidia  somewhat better


[11-May-19 02:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> F1 mini is an FPGA. it does about 25MHs at about 25 Watts


[11-May-19 02:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i like cpu seems like a more even playing field


[11-May-19 02:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> oh nice


[11-May-19 02:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That's indeed the vision of this project


[11-May-19 02:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> should i try 16 cores? im guessing i shouldnt leave it at 16 though right

[11-May-19 02:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yes, you can. The integrated miner is pretty forgiving... But if it affects your GUI, you can always lower it by 1 thread at the time


[11-May-19 02:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> nice


[11-May-19 02:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i was mining Nerva for a bit. how do u guys compare to them?


[11-May-19 02:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I don't know Nerva. I commited to this project for its vision. The money isn't my main objective


[11-May-19 02:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> ya i didnt mean money wise


[11-May-19 02:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i left there server and stopped mining becasue there community on discord was horrible


[11-May-19 02:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> This is a very friendly community. Never seen an argumant here


[11-May-19 02:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> great


[11-May-19 02:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> disagreements: yes, but not to the point that it became uncomfortable


[11-May-19 02:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> it was toxic on there server


[11-May-19 02:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> and people abusing power there if u disagree with them


[11-May-19 02:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That would drive me away too


[11-May-19 02:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> they actually have a channel called #exile that they put u in if u get into an arguement or disagree


[11-May-19 02:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> ts embarrasing

[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> also seen this project backed by some big names which always helps


[11-May-19 03:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Our lead dev is kind of big, yes...


[11-May-19 03:00 AM] Gateway#3763

[11-May-19 03:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> of course


[11-May-19 03:01 AM] Gateway#3763

[11-May-19 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> 2 reasons: we don't believe in paying an exchange to get listed, so they can earn their commisions and we're only a (just) 1-year old chain. being listed on an abundant amount of exchanges does nothing for value or developement


[11-May-19 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> good reasons.


[11-May-19 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i dont know much which is why im asking


[11-May-19 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> Votes*


[11-May-19 03:08 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> nerva is in 2nd now


[11-May-19 03:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I don't imagine they paid. Voting basically gets you listed for free...


[11-May-19 03:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Ah, you just quoted that


[11-May-19 03:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> lol


[11-May-19 03:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> so Verus is not even trying to get voted in since the chain is too young basically?


[11-May-19 03:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Too young is not the reason. I think it would be worth a shot to get listed there on votes


[11-May-19 03:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i see


[11-May-19 03:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> somone from verus should apply then üòõ


[11-May-19 03:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> we would smash the votes


[11-May-19 03:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i think u can vote once a day


[11-May-19 03:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Digital Price has about 95% of our daily volume, which is roughly 1-2 BTC a day.

[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> ya i seen that site quickly


[11-May-19 03:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Anyone from our community can do that... We don't need approval or anything...


[11-May-19 03:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i hear u . but would help if it was one of the devs or something so can also put a message asking ppl to vote if they have time etc


[11-May-19 03:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> if i did it no oen would care or vote or see any messages asking them to vote lol


[11-May-19 03:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> If you post the link, people will vote.... People will listen to the devs, but it's not that they control it.


[11-May-19 03:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Don¬¥t it cost a lot to get listed? People seem happy with DP, even though it has been down for maintanance quite a lot. Very few are using STEX, will another exchange really matter? Not sure myself.


[11-May-19 03:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> no but would prolly get more voted and faster if one of the devs did it i would guess


[11-May-19 03:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i dont know either.., just asking and learning


[11-May-19 03:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Crupti We could get voted into being listed for free


[11-May-19 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Oink Then I don¬¥t see why not üòÉ


[11-May-19 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> we havce more users in this discord then Nerva and they are switching between 1st and 2nd in votes


[11-May-19 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> we would win in no time im sure lol


[11-May-19 03:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Just looking at their agreement... This is a bit fuzzy: ` Legal, true and accurate personal data is required;`, no details on what data is required exactly

[11-May-19 03:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> thats why im saying someone that knows what there doing should apply.. or not apply lol


[11-May-19 03:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> If this exchanges requires KYC info, just to exchange between cryptos, a lot of people won't bother.

[11-May-19 03:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> it should


[11-May-19 03:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> its fully legaized here now lol


[11-May-19 03:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> so might as well be lol


[11-May-19 03:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> let's just say: I'm Dutch, and leave it at that...


[11-May-19 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> awesome lol


[11-May-19 03:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> or wait thats only amsterdam and not all of netherlands


[11-May-19 03:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> i guess its illegal still in the rest of netherlands?


[11-May-19 03:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> We should move to #off-topic for this discussion


[11-May-19 03:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <KhR0N1K> lol ok my bad no worries


[11-May-19 03:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Shouldnt we go for an Asian market exchange? I don¬¥t think neither DP or STEX support any of the asian languages.


[11-May-19 03:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> It would be wise to decentralize on exchanges too, I think. So Asian market is a good idea


[11-May-19 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> ZBG.com is big Asian exchange, perhaps too big for Verus atm?

[11-May-19 03:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I agree, but this scares me: `We run all exchange-websites in Mozilla‚Äôs Observatory-test (https://observatory.mozilla.org/). The score in such test is one of many indicators of the exchange‚Äôs security. ZBG only received an F-score in this test. This is naturally below industry average and is thus not a competitive advantage at all for this trading platform.`

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Got the page to finally open. I don‚Äôt have all the info they want... üòí


[11-May-19 04:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> heard about it from some friends in 2012, but I thought nothing of it


[11-May-19 04:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> made no sense to me than, as it was described to me.


[11-May-19 04:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Me too, I was busy with other stuff, so back then it was no priority for me... stupid, stupid, stupid...


[11-May-19 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> "Value out if the thin air" poposterous, I though. That was before I got educated that the FIAT currencies of the world are also not tied to a fixed commodity but rather created out of the thin air by the central banks üòÉ


[11-May-19 04:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Think they stopped tying FIAT to fixed commodities like gold in the 20s or 30s worldwide.


[11-May-19 04:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Indeed. The value of our money hasn‚Äôt been backed by gold for a longer time than most of us know....


[11-May-19 04:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Most people think that money is backed by "something physical", though, as did I üòÉ


[11-May-19 04:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> The only thing backing it is ‚Äúperception of value‚Äù....


[11-May-19 04:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Is aacoin still functional? Think they're a decent sized asian exchange that we are on.


[11-May-19 04:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> What¬¥s great with ZBG.com is that they welcome new coins, they have their own "Innovation Zone" list of traiding pairs. Very nice üòÉ And they don¬¥t have a listing fee, got a decent volume, and will be the first asian Verus exchange for asian fans.


[11-May-19 04:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> And it¬¥s listed on CMC, for Verus to be on CMC we need a second CMC exchange I think.


[11-May-19 04:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I definitely do not have all the info they want. Also I don‚Äôt feel comfortable giving out contact details of developers etc. without them being aware... I should discuss it with them first.


[11-May-19 09:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> aacoin is not great


[11-May-19 11:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> lol btc/vrsc


[12-May-19 12:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @dude Yes, I think ppl are selling altcoins for bitcoin as it pumps. Bitcoin dominance is going up.


[12-May-19 12:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> yeah I agree and think the same


[12-May-19 12:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Once it stops pumping ppl will buy altcoins again I think, but I¬¥m no expert üòÑ


[12-May-19 12:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> but I would never sell for that price


[12-May-19 12:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> More to earn with BTC for the moment I guess. Some YTber said that BTC usually pumps first, then the altcoins.


[12-May-19 12:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Not sure if it¬¥s true, but makes somewhat sense in my head. The reasoning is that people sell their altcoins to join the BTC pump, when it flattens people sell off BTC for altcoins and as a result they start pumping.


[12-May-19 12:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> it‚Äôs maybe one reason


[12-May-19 01:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> No real news with Verus today that I¬¥ve heard atleast, so that would explain the selloff.


[12-May-19 01:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> People still look at fiat prices... They sell when they get high fiat. They don't realize they loose money because they could've gotten more sats for their alts


[12-May-19 01:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> If you time it right, you could earn good money selling altcoins for BTC and when BTC flattens buying some good altcoins for them - but it¬¥s hard to predict the top/bottom.


[12-May-19 01:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> If it were easy, we'ld all be rich


[12-May-19 01:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> I hodl because I suck at predicting where things go.


[12-May-19 01:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Oink Says the one guy I know with a 2,000 BTC wallet üòÑ lol


[12-May-19 01:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I hodl because I believe in this project. And because I'm waiting for my shitcoins to go up, to minimize losses.


[12-May-19 01:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Back then it was 2k.... it doubled by now...

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> ü§£


[12-May-19 01:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Good morning, by the way


[12-May-19 01:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> I¬¥m with you on that, @Oink PBaaS could be the next big thing. I also believe in staking coins as it causes people to not sell but rather get interest - further pusing the price. My LindaCoin has exploded in value for example, and Verus being a very good staking coin in addition to PoW with about 38% yearly interest atm I think is the perfect coin.


[12-May-19 01:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> More a question about marketing, most people think PBaaS is brilliant once they understand it. Merge mining is also a nice feature that Verus has.


[12-May-19 01:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I did some math yesterday. yearly staking rewards are now down to 28%, but it's still a lot.


[12-May-19 01:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> kk


[12-May-19 01:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I've been tweeting some stuff about PBaaS and @Godballz made an excellent article on PBaas, so we're working on the marketing. You just cannot market effectively if you cannot show people what it does exactly. Makes it hard to understand


[12-May-19 01:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Linda is 50% yearly staking interest I think(don¬¥t quote me), there are staking coins that yield more interest, but when I looked at them last year most had very low volume.


[12-May-19 01:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> So, by Verus being a 50% staking 50% PoW coin with a decent volume I gather that 28% staking reward is still pretty good.


[12-May-19 01:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> People discovered the staking on Verus the last couple of months, so I saw the profitability half over the past 3 months.


[12-May-19 01:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That's by the way assuming ALL available coins are staking (timelocked funds and Z-balances exempted)


[12-May-19 01:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> No point in having 1,500% staking reward if no one buys your coins üòÑ


[12-May-19 01:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Indeed. but 28% makes a nice ROI if you want to leave it there for your pension, like me...


[12-May-19 01:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Yes, but with crypto it¬¥s always more of a gamble than an investment, though.


[12-May-19 01:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Isn't any investment an educated gamble?


[12-May-19 01:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> You never know hwat the staking coin is worth next month.


[12-May-19 01:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Some say so üòÉ


[12-May-19 01:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> True, but with the knowledge of upcoming technologies for a coin, you can make an educated gamble whether it will survive in the long run or even grow valuable


[12-May-19 01:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Was a guy on YT chat yesterday that wanted to pawn his $30k truck for BTC, had to tell him that BTC is a gamble not an investment and asked him if he would gamble his truck on roulette in LV üòÑ


[12-May-19 01:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> I tell people all the time...only spend what you would readily throw into a fire


[12-May-19 01:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> they usually look at me funny


[12-May-19 01:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Saw a guy on Reddit the other day that had borrowed funds from family and asked advice on how to get crypto for it... I advised him to go to Vegas, because if you don't know what you're doing the odds of getting profit are better there...


[12-May-19 01:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> At least he would have a good time there...


[12-May-19 01:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> People I know think it must be easy.  But they only see my end result...not all the people that loose it all.  They think I am just trying to keep them out of moon lambos

[12-May-19 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> OTC trading for VerusCoin is available on https://app.barterlly.io


[12-May-19 03:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> They're still in Beta, but during beta this escrow OTC applies only standard chain-fees, no other fees!


[12-May-19 03:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> This means I'll have to update some website thingies... üòÉ


[12-May-19 03:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Some explanation on OTC and escrow:

OTC stands for *Over The Counter*, which basically means you trade directly with your counterpart that wants to trade with you. The risk involved in this is you have to trust your counterpart to send his coin, after you send yours and vice versa.

Escrow means you hand your funds over to a third party after you agree with your counterpart to a trade. Your trade partner does the same and as soon as the 3rd party receives the agreed funds from both trade partners, the traded funds are released to the traders (after a fee is applied), thus eliminating the risk in being scammed. If no payment is received from either trade partner, your funds will be return after a set period of time


[12-May-19 03:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> In short: your funds don‚Äôt sit endlessly on an exchange where your funds are potentially vulnerable, they stay in your own wallet until you make a trade, safely under your own control and you‚Äôre secured by escrow once you make the trade.


[12-May-19 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dwy> Hello, thanks for this @Oink , yeah, the main goal is to allow people trading with unknown people safely

[dscrdvrsc] <ABK> Hope Verus will put us all in the black at some point


[12-May-19 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @ABK I hope so too üòÉ for me, it‚Äôs hard to be as optimistic as I am and see that most people just see Verus as another coin. The good news is that since we are not trying to drive speculation, when people do start to understand and use PBaaS, our growth will be driven by use, and lack of significant speculation should be a positive. I‚Äôm personally working to get to that point as soon as we can together. I will take a few hours off for Mother‚Äôs Day, but if all goes well today, we expect another PBaaS upgrade to the test network, and I hope we‚Äôll get a lot of people making and trying out their own blockchains this week! Happy Mother‚Äôs Day to all mothers and all those who have them üòÉ


[12-May-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> ok, let's continue here @Godballz  @Oink  .and @allwhomaybeinterested:
Getting back to ```the point on centralization is a good one that may benefit from further consideration. I'd be happy to change channels but hypothetically speaking, if every other coin did suddenly join Verus' PBaaS ecosystem would it really cause centralization? I mean sure it would centralize the work efficiently which is a good thing but that's about it. Maybe it would create a hardware preference too but as far as miner centralization and ownership, I think they'd be more decentralized. Just trying to think, what negatives could come of it?``` (found in #trading )
Well, although I think that Verus and PBaaS might cover many aspects of other blockchains, it probably can't cover *all* of them, including their special features like multi-algo approach and alike. 
And when including all into one blockchain, it would also mean to combine all algos into one, which may be considered as some kind of centralisation, and might add concerns about security aspects. 
Besides that, at least BTC blockchain would still be required when notarisation shall be kept the way it is at the moment.


[12-May-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I‚Äôm still letting the centralization part sink in.
Any chain that chooses to use a different algo and doesn‚Äôt want to leave it behind, won‚Äôt be able to go to PBaaS, obviously. That‚Äôs not a bad thing, because it‚Äôs for specialized hardware designers more profitable to design for just 1 algo, than having to divide their attention to multiple algos. All coins as PBaaS autochains would definitely incite that development and result in massive mining centralization.
As soon as any chain has significant value, it will present possible high rewards for those that seek to compromise the chains integrity. The security needs to be perfect for that.
Right now Verus uses dPoW as redundant security, on top of the PoP. I cannot say if we actually need it or not, but it sure feels good to have it in place. Being the top of all chains would make that impossible.


[12-May-19 09:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> About centralization: only the Verus chain development would be somewhat centralized, not the control over the network, like with many chains now. Since Verus is a community effort, the development could be more decentralized as we grow and add developers...


[12-May-19 09:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> That's right, just when having the single algo for all that chains, doors would be wide open for FPGAs and alike. Personally, I'd prefer Verus to be an application-based blockchain, not a speculation-driven one.


[12-May-19 09:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> The entire blockchain ecosystem can be seen as a pyramid, or more accurately, a reversed tree, with lots of branches. I wouldn‚Äôt know how to avoid that kind of centralization.


[12-May-19 09:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> Sure, and as any decentralised, somewhat uncontrolled development implies a sort of natural evolution, only those best adapted to the requirements will sustain in the long run. So I think most of currently existing blockchain projects will be abandoned sooner or later, if those don't get absorbed or assimilate themselves to the more suitable ones, what I consider Verus to be one of. However, I think there will be several major branches in the future, depending on what philosophy they transport - may it be speculation, application, or something completely different nobody thought about yet. And blockchain evolution will enforce it's merciless judgement, regardless of all brilliant ideas üòâ


[12-May-19 09:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I prefer multiple chains next to each other. If some of them want to be speculative, that‚Äôll draw away the speculation from the chains that don‚Äôt want to go that route. It‚Äôll also help securing our chain, since the other chain may be insanely more profitable to hack.


[12-May-19 09:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> A bit like home security: you don't need a top-notch security system, just make your place less attractive to burglars than your neighbours.


[12-May-19 09:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> With reference to merge mining, something just came to my attention. It‚Äôs IMO a crude comparison, but this way of thinking can potentially destroy any coin that can be merge mined. Can we protect PBaaS against this?

[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> IMO anyway


[12-May-19 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> ETH, nor VBK are my concern here, I‚Äôm concerned about future PBaaS autochains. Young chains can be ruined before they have the chance to develop. That development can lead to innovation. Innovation is not something to be trashed, out of short term monetary gain.


[12-May-19 10:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> Guess it'd rather depend on asset value at exchange, rather than on main or side chain coin. Profit-miners wouldn't dump the less valuable thing.


[12-May-19 10:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Price wise I guess the smaller projects would be an ever present threat for the established coin


[12-May-19 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> As the smaller project rises, the breakeven cost for the larger one is reduced


[12-May-19 11:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Sorry, just catching back up. Good points on multi-algo projects, I do think there will have to be diversity going forward but I do believe there will be a culling of sorts where scams and lesser projects will fall away or find protection in more established chains with uses like in Verus' PBaaS chains.
The issue  @Oink raises is one I've considered myself but the best example I can think of to explain this would be natural selection. If a project truly has value, it should survive/thrive but if it doesn't then it might not. It could create new dynamics, sure, but I do think a natural equilibrium will arise and I don't think the parent chain would ever be at risk even if there were greater interest in one of the PBaaS chains because in order to merge mine both enough to be able to dump the main, it'd cause an increase in difficulty of the parent chain, meaning more competition mining. 
It's difficult to try to predict this early anyway but it doesn't hurt to think about. The complex elements at play under the current system are impossible enough to predict right now, add to that another layer of complexity in the stand alone self-sufficient full out ecosystem Verus is bringing with it and all bets are off. In any case I think Verus is one of the most forward-thinking projects to date (embracing all hardware for one example) and are at the forefront of cutting edge crypto technology.
 I feel fortunate to be here at this stage. Verus is establishing itself as a key architect in the evolving landscape of this burgeoning crypto world. 
Happy to be here now, looking forward to what comes next..

[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> Close Agama.
Browse to %AppData%\Komodo\VRSC and add the following list to the bottom of your VRSC.conf, just below rpcallowip=127.0.0.1:
addnode=95.216.252.182
addnode=104.18.42.17

After you added those 2 nodes, remove every file which are directly in VRSC folder, none from the subfolders (or at least move to a different location) except wallet.dat and vrsc.conf. 
Make sure you don't remove any folders, or you'll have to use the bootstrap.
Then restart Agama.

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Thoskk @Oink, I was thinking about the earlier discussion about potential dumping of rewards and diversity in algorithms and I came up with a question- could a multi algorithm project join the Verus ecosystem by incorporating VerusHash 2.0 if it came up enough to notarize? Probably doesn't matter since there is good reason for  different  projects with different purposes but it got me curious if that could be done.

Verus brings Public Blockchains as a Service (PBaaS) to the Komodo...
Verus has solved the problem N@S (Nothing at Stake) that threatens the PoS work test by eliminating weak subjectivity.

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I linked it in reddit. Hopefully it stays up..


[13-May-19 07:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I cannot say I agree with the way PBaaS is described.... It sounds to me that that were getting paid for all services rendered, while AFAIK the payment is only for notarization of the PBaaS autochain.


[13-May-19 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> why do i have over 8k confirms on coin i received?


[13-May-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Because you received it 8k blocks ago...


[13-May-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> i thought you only received a few confirms


[13-May-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> didn't know you still received confirms


[13-May-19 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Basically every new block confirms all previous blocks.


[13-May-19 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> like delivery, costs more for the more confirms


[13-May-19 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> err more for less confirms


[13-May-19 09:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> No, it doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs basically by confirming the previous block. Since every block uses consensus, you can be pretty sure you are on the correct chain after a number of blocks. So the older the transaction (the more confirmations) the more trustworthy that balance is.


[13-May-19 09:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> BTC it costs more to decrease the confirms amount and decrease delivery time of funds


[13-May-19 09:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Codeman> almost all transactions do on all crypto


[13-May-19 09:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Correct. Because on less confirmations there is higher risk that something may go (intentional or not) wrong.


[13-May-19 09:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> @Codeman  you are thinking of gas


[13-May-19 09:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> tx fees


[13-May-19 09:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Badfish> gas (tx fees) and confirmations are  totally different things

[13-May-19 12:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> New version of the cli coming out that will be a mandatory upgrade for everyone?


[13-May-19 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Or is it something strictly pbaas related?


[13-May-19 12:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Not PBaaS related... The CLI & GUI will stop functioning if not upgraded in time... So work a new release is being created now

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Someone needs to clue em in at some point. Verus solves literally every issue described, offering both privacy and security without sacrificing scalability, while remaining public (this is something unheard of outside this community, most erroneously believe that in order to excel, businesses must move to privately owned blockchains instead, meaning allowing for a massive hole in security to be an integral component of their system!). It may not be known yet that there are better ways but when word does get out Verus' PBaaS is going to take the world by storm- <https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblack/2019/05/13/microsoft-and-intel-detail-the-deep-seated-problems-with-blockchain/amp/>


[14-May-19 05:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I kid about clueing them in though, really. With such big players it might be wisest to fly low on their radar till things are in full swing but still, where a functional version of PBaaS is already in motion at this very moment, I don't think even those big players with their closed minded views on the technology, can compete.


[14-May-19 05:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Don‚Äôt forget: these are just the parts that this particular journalist picked up and highlighted. But even those points are futile:
- performance: scales with number of PBaaS chains
- confidentiality: zk-snarks ensures confidentiality on a public blockchain.
- governance: isn‚Äôt that what blockchains are fundamentally about? To decentralize governance, so every participant is equally in charge (consensus).
- Processing power: by comparing it to the most energy inefficient chain you always look good. PBaaS uses power that is already available with merge mining.

Let them believe in their ideals. Time will tell which model is viable.
(I have a strong feeling I know which one, though)


[14-May-19 07:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Carlos Crypto Economy> Thanks @Oink !


[14-May-19 08:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Oink plus the more chains that get added the more efficient Verus becomes. PBaaS is designed as such. Imagine all cryptos right now under a PBaaS-like system. The entire crypto world would use the energy it takes to mine a single project and that project itself is super efficient on CPUs AND it is halved even further because it is 50% PoS. Elegant, beautifully designed system, really.

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @nettrip I don't know if I understand the details of what you have done that isn't working. If you have mined or staked those funds, it may be that you need to create a private address in your wallet in the "receive" screen, then in the send screen, select "shield all recent coinbases" and shield your coinbase transactions to the new private address. After they have been shielded once, they can be sent to transparent addresses and used normally.

I've message a few struggling projects too that at one point had legitimate use cases but for one reason or another, began to fall apart (insecure chain, poor former managment or algo choice, etc) so they might consider a potential future coin swap to get more onboard to join the next big evolution in blockchain technology. üòÅ

[dscrdvrsc] <plazma> hi i m back


[16-May-19 03:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I've got a nice discussion starter here. We already discussed it a bit in #off-topic , but I feel more people may have an opinion on the matter:


[16-May-19 03:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> With mining activities using enormous amounts of electricity from the mentioned Common-Pool Resources (CPR) and that amount ever growing, that would mean that PoW blockchains or even our own PoP mechanism can in the end not be sustained.

Mining is meant as a mechanism to make the chain work, secure it. An incentive to help the chain is offered in the form of a block-reward. Nowadays the majority of the miners don‚Äôt mine to secure a network, but their sole purpose is cold, hard profit.

While mining is profitable, hardware developers produce more powerful miners, that use more energy. To feed these beasts, the need to be centralized in areas where energy is cheap. In order to stay making profits, the need exists to keep buying that equipment, which raises the profits to your old level. The only ones making more profits are the energy companies and the hardware manufacturers.

The undesired result for any blockchain is that mining power is heavily centralized.

IMO the only way to keep sustaining PoW is to severely limit the maximum allowed hashrate on a chain. The biggest question is: how?


[16-May-19 03:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Since mining is done locally, the chain has no influence over the amount of hashpower needed to solve a block, except for varying the difficulty. Since the difficulty is basically the governor for the chains blocktime and depends itself on the total networkhash, using network difficulty is not an option.

Out PoS system uses a minimum UTXO age to prevent from 1 UTXO a second time within 150 blocks. Could we use a similar mechanism to limit a miner from successfully submitting a block to the chain if he already successfully submitted one in the last, say 150 blocks?

If we could implement this mechanism and make the block submission cool down time dependent on a desired network hashrate. The
Desired network hashrate could be dialed in, in such a way that mining on a raspberry pi would give you the same chance to find a block, as an F1+ FPGA. Combine that with a block submission cool down time for new addresses and switching to a new address won't give you an advantage as a miner.


[16-May-19 03:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Mechanisms to bypass this limitation would be possible, but implementing that the block submission cool down time only works when that wallet is still mining (at a minimum hashrate, a fraction of the power used, to create a heartbeat for the miner) then it would get increasingly difficult to bypass the system.

Such a mechanism would stimulate decentralization (pool mining will be obsolete), reduce global energy consumption, reduce the need to develop faster specialized mining hardware and make it about securing the network again, instead of profit.


[16-May-19 03:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> Just want to add that we discussed some ideas about that in #off-topic  on May 16, from 10:52 pm (UTC+2, CEST / CET DST), so it may be interesting to read there also.


[16-May-19 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> Hm...@Oink- that system is intriguing, well thought out and obviously well intentioned. The problem is that the profit motive/incentive is not merely a by product of public blockchain implementation and infrastructure. It is essential and integral to the mechanisms that make them sustainable and make them thrive. That's the whole point of PoW- No one would bother mining, and thus securing the network, if they didn't make a profit. Then we'd be left with private, permissioned blockchains, which in a sense, is what we already have now, with modern day business systems/organizations and their proprietary systems. If we begin to artificially implement the kind of hobbling mechanism you articulate, it would be almost purely idealistic, and would almost certainly (in my opinion) hamstring the adoption and development of any chain that went that route.


[16-May-19 07:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> The reason that capitalism in the context of a free and fair democracy is still the most successful financial system in history (in terms of the broad base of involvement and enfranchisement that it engenders) is the unfettered (sort of) opportunities that it gives for multiple parties to have at it, with the fittest, so to speak, rising to the top. Now, this is an oversimplification, and glosses over many of the glaring problems with these systems, but in broad terms, that is essentially how we can describe them. In essence, democratic capitalism is a human, organic Proof of Work system...literally. So, the question is if your idea of a cool down mechanism is akin to the regulation that is intrinsic to these democratic capitalist systems. Well, yes, but therein lies a subtle distinction. You can't be too heavy with regulation or you stifle creativity, innovation, meritocracy. Of course, if you're too lax, then the wealthy, powerful, or plain ruthless and unscrupulous simply run roughshod over the masses, quickly turning the entire system into an unfair, unsustainable oligopoly.


[16-May-19 07:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> The answer lies somewhere in between. It would need to be wielded more like a scalpel than a hammer. I believe this is exactly what the cpu equalization mechanism intrinsic to Verus was meant to address, and I believe it is one such example of an elegant attempt to mitigate the dangers you speak of. Whether it's enough is a question that will have to be continually addressed, as we've already seen with the necessitation of Verushash 2.0 to counter the nebulous fpga's. That response by @miketout and the team, I believe, is emblematic of the kind of approach that will be required to address the big questions we will continue to face- vision, courage, innovation and steadfastness in pursuit of the ultimate goal.


[16-May-19 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Extremely well put, @jintaa!

[17-May-19 12:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @jintaa, thanks for the feedback. I didn‚Äôt think that factor through as thoroughly as you put it down here... I‚Äôll need to let this simmer a bit...


[17-May-19 02:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Although the idea was inspired by the massive drop in network has seen last monday, your answer made it clear to me that this system should not be used to arbitrarily block out high end systems. The fact that I am using the word arbitrarily implies that we would centrally decide which hardware is acceptable to use and which are not. A blockchain is a consensus system, if this system is to be used in a chain, the parameters the system uses must be acquired by consensus too (a PBaaS poll could come in handy for this).
The mechanism is not meant to cripple a chains developement, although I see the possibility of doing so if the paramaters are too strict. In fact I gave the example of too strict parameters myself by tuning down the profit model so far that a Pi would have the same profit chances as a FPGA. I fully agree we  are depending on peoples greed to keep the PoW securing the network in place. What I intend to achieve is a more evenly distribution of the hashpower, by limiting the centralized upscaling of hashpower (just like government do with anti-monopoly regulations) and promoting adoption of this blockchain by more people by offering them a fair chance to profit from securing the chain on their own, with *relatively* low spec devices that everybody can afford, or in  already own.
Bear in mind that if and only if the parameters are set correctly, it would only effectively restrict your earning if a desired the network hashrate is large enough to effectively secure the chain. The mechanism is it's own profitability mechanisme: if the hashrate is high, it's not profitable enough for some people to be enticed to mine, but if the hashrate is low the profitability will entice them to hop on. It is basically making use of the profit-switching mining conduct people are displaying today.


[17-May-19 02:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> The upgrade to Verushash 2.0 is indeed an elegant way to mitigate the dangers of hash power centralization. The effect it has does indeed seem to have the reuired effect. We cannot expect, however, for every chain to adopt this algorithm, nor do I wish to. (If only one algorithm would survive, it would be everybodies focus to find loopholes in it). The mechanism could be implemented on any PoW based algorithm, should the developers wish to do that, because the mechanism is not working on hardware level or algorithm level, but on blockchain level.
It could also provide an extra security for 100% PoW chains, since the needed 51% for a succesful attack would be much harder to achieve. Also it could help in the (idealistic, I admit) goals of global energy preservation. In this context I'll make a comparison to a known practise in the navy:
`On any submarine there's an ongoing hunt to identify and eleminate the loudest noise, in order to make the boat more silent and less detectable. Once the loudest noise is eliminated another existing noise is labeled as the loudest noise.` Society is doing the exact same thing in energy consumption rigt now: from the transition from filament lightbulbs to LED light bulbs to the transition from gas guzzlers to energy efficient cars.


[17-May-19 02:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I predict a time where blockchain mining is considered a waist of energy (In fact China already named it as one of their reasons in trying to reduce the national blockchain industry), despite the profits it yields.
Humans insatiable urge to deplete (natural) resources for monetary gain is a big factor that drives our global economy, but at the same time puts that economy at risk, due to depletion of said resources. I'ld hate to see the same happen to the blockchain economy.
Bear in mind that I put up my original piece to start a discussion, so I welcome all feedback, positive and negative.


[17-May-19 03:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Oink perhaps toying with the cooldown time (lowering it) would still give everyone the same chance in a sense like you describe but better machines would still average out to slightly higher rewards due to their ability to find the blocks faster when they are not in "cooldown mode" averaged out over time?


[17-May-19 03:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Dunno, still like the uniqueness of the idea and agree in the value of diversification


[17-May-19 03:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Better machines will always have a higher chance of finding and submitting a block after the cooldown time is over. So their rewards will always remain higher that low end systems. It's just a matter whether it is economically viable to keep them mining on a chain that caps their profits.


[17-May-19 03:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Right, so due to averaging out over time, you may be able to mitigate the issue described above and still maintain a capitalist friendly model


[17-May-19 03:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I guess tweaking the cool-down time could allow you to have some control


[17-May-19 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> I fail to see how a cool down could work other than be a gate on an open field to go around. I feel like I‚Äôm missing the point.


[17-May-19 03:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> If when you get a block reward, there is a say 10 minute cool down before you can get another one, then someone with a powerful machine that finds a block every second will have to wait just as long as someone who has a less powerful machine that finds a block every minute. Basically


[17-May-19 03:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> I mean, we‚Äôre focusing on privacy as a key word. It‚Äôs hard to limit something unless you start collecting data on devices/people.

@Godballz Poor pool owners. ^^


[17-May-19 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> It would be built into consensus I believe


[17-May-19 03:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I don't think it would have anything to do with identifying anyone


[17-May-19 03:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @zpajk using mechanisms that exist in blockchains, I believe this can be done without gathering any data. A mining reward could be payed using a P2SH address (already used to govern the time locked blocks on our network) and using those conditions to allow or deny the submission of a block.


[17-May-19 03:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> So no pools allowed? That benefits large players.


[17-May-19 03:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Or address change on every won block?


[17-May-19 03:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That depends on how strict the parameters would be applied. But it could be used to avoid concentration of power, which pools are too. I think it would actually not benefit large players, because they will be economically be restricted more than small solo miners, that don‚Äôt find a block within a day anyway.


[17-May-19 03:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> It actually favors large amounts of small miners, as opposed to a small number of big miners.


[17-May-19 03:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Address change on every block would be something worth investigating. It could undermine the entire idea indeed.


[17-May-19 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> It could just be a cool down on newly created addresses if that's doable?


[17-May-19 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Same cool down no matter what


[17-May-19 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Seeing how power/hash can be split and mimicked I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs a no go as well. This is why I like Verushash 2, which has very good hardware and software balance. It may not be perfectly balanced against fpgas, but it‚Äôs doing a great job.


[17-May-19 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I agree @Godballz , but what if you create the addresses in advance?


[17-May-19 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That is a good point


[17-May-19 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I mean it would only be good for bursts but they could be a large bursts

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I agree on both points @zpajk . That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm hoping for a golden idea to emerge from this discussion.


[17-May-19 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Perhaps upon syncing to chain if that's doable?


[17-May-19 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> At least that way in order for them to do that they would have to keep all those addresses connected


[17-May-19 03:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Godballz that would, IMO, mean privacy gets compromised, not to mention the load on the chain would increase if it has to keep track of addresses tied together.


[17-May-19 03:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> No I mean if any new address joins the network it is subject to a cool-down


[17-May-19 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Would that compromise privacy? Maybe I'm missing something


[17-May-19 03:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I misunderstood your post on keep al addresses connected to the chain. I interpreted it as the chain keeping track of connecting addresses from 1 wallet.


[17-May-19 03:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Oh gotcha


[17-May-19 03:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> My interpretation is a non-acceptable solution to me, from a privacy point of view.


[17-May-19 04:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Basically as I see it right now, the idea has a fatal flaw: which is switching to a different address!


[17-May-19 04:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> So a cool-down for those addresses joining wouldn't help with that? It would at least force anyone trying to game the system to keep every one of those addresses connected all the time


[17-May-19 04:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> If you create say 150 addresses in one go and switch to them sequentially, they would all meet the age specifications after the cooldown is done, leaving you free to switch mining to the next 'free' address as soon as you hit a block. I can imagine this being done using a script of sorts.


[17-May-19 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> A cooldown on address would ony work if you're prohibited to use any other address. I think that's a restriction we don't want.


[17-May-19 04:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I do agree however, that keeping the addresses connected while the cooldown takes place would seriously hinder efforts to play the system


[17-May-19 04:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Maybe not the same cooldown but there is no way to put a time restriction on any address change


[17-May-19 04:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Oh okay yeah I agree it really would just make things more difficult


[17-May-19 04:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Might be a bad idea but just throwing this out there - what about every x blocks automatic cool down along with mention system


[17-May-19 04:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> The only option I can think of to overcome this is to include a hash of the unique hardware ID into the P2SH reward payment, to exclude the hardware from submitting a block for the durating of the cooldown. Including it in a P2SH payment basically means it stays private. But I cannot see all the implications of this.


[17-May-19 04:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> If I'm correct, it would mean that Pools are back in business...


[17-May-19 04:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Not sure how the consensus algorithm works, but I would think there's only 2 points of keeping track of addresses, either when submitting solutions or Coinbase payouts, as such P2SH. But that doesn't hinder anyone from changing address upon winning rewards.


[17-May-19 04:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> It's a hard harmony to achieve between hardware, software, algorithm and profit. Any of them change there's going to be fluctuations. üòÑ


[17-May-19 04:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Submitting a hardware ID (hashed or not) into P2SH conditions is not going to work either: simply switch to a different address: the P2SH conditions on the previous address aren't valid for this address... However, it would enable pool mining.


[17-May-19 04:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Godballz Can you explain a bit more about the *every x block automatic cooldown*? I don't really grasp the idea (yet)?


[17-May-19 05:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Well it wouldn't stop anything actually it would just make more of an inconvenience if say 30% of your list of addresses are unusable. Not really a good solution at all tbh. Just figured maybe another obstacle but that'd give it's own tradeoffs I'm sure.  @Oink


[17-May-19 05:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Agree. It would effect everybody on the chain, also the people with just 1 address.


[17-May-19 05:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I guess single address people could build that time into their in-between blocks time it wouldn't change much so long as it didn't affect security


[17-May-19 05:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I may have thought of something that may be viable: What if we submit a hash into the found block that represents the miner (h/w + s/w ID combined into 1 hash) in a First In First Out string on the chain and let the blockchain itself determine if the admitted block is from a miner who's hashed ID is present in that string?  That would make it fully consensus based.


[17-May-19 05:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> It is basically the same mechanism that determines if a UTXO is spent or not.


[17-May-19 05:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> So long as the ID can't be spoofed. There  could be big incentive to find a workaround

[dscrdvrsc] <dude> how to make sure that the ios app is a binary from the github repo? isnt it better to compile it by myself from the code and just install it as third party app? or is there some kind of "veruscoin non profit foundation" that cares about the ios app ?


[03-Jun-19 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @dude the link goes to testflight, where you can download it through Apple. that is the binary @michaeltoutjr provided


[03-Jun-19 09:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <michaeltoutjr> You can download and compile yourself if you would like, the link provided to test flight exists because there is no other conventional way to distribute iOS apps for beta testing.


[03-Jun-19 09:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dude> yeah but TestFlight means there is already an apple dev account. Are you going to release the app on the official iOS app store ?


[03-Jun-19 09:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <michaeltoutjr> That is the plan, yes, however the app is currently under my dev account, and for the app store release, we will need to release it under the VerusCoin Foundation


[03-Jun-19 10:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <006vl> Hello,

I have some questions regarding project. I mean no offense by anything I say, as I am misunderstanding a lot of things given my lack of knowledge.

I can't really wrap my head around what VerusCoin is doing. It seems like a hybrid (PoW with unique hash and PoS) coin, with the ability to create individual blockchains.
Doesn't the goal of this project conflict with Komodoplatform, its parent chain? What's the utility of making another platform, when the parent chain is also geared towards accessibility towards new blockchain creators? What is the utility of this coin?


[03-Jun-19 11:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Hi, thanks for the question. In fact, no one, not Komodo or any other project is doing what Verus is doing.


[03-Jun-19 11:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Verus is part of the Komodo ecosystem, which is a system that can support many chains working together, however a project may decide to leverage that capability. For Verus, it was a great starting point for public blockchains as a service.


[03-Jun-19 11:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> PBaaS, is consistent with the concept of the Komodo ecosystem, but a fully decentralized model that has no one but miners, stakers, node operators and others that support the network in exchange for earning across many publicly merge mined and staked chains that can also engage in high volume (additional new technology in progress) cross-chain operations with enhanced programmability . They also still have the ability to be notarized and interoperate with the rest of the Komodo ecosystem as well.


[03-Jun-19 11:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> PBaaS chains are run entirely by the Verus network plus the PBaaS chain's network and require Verus to launch and auto-notarize. They can be started very quickly, run for days, can prove all blocks and transactions independently with a single number, which can serve as an archive root for polls and elections or archived business chains, and they get all the benefits of Verus itself. They get a provably 51% hash attack resistant Verus proof of power algorithm. They get independence and separability from the Verus ecosystem. They get Komodo interoperability, the same CPU-mineability and field tested FPGA-equalization of VerusHash 2.0, and they will have the ability to be reserve currencies with protocol based, market driven conversion. Verus is basically pushing the envelope of the decentralized Komodo model, and making it easy for any project to create single-chain currencies and applications as part of a decentralized, merge mineable, Komodo compatible system, or many-chain applications that can create and archive chains as part of the application.


[03-Jun-19 11:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> PBaaS will allow anyone or any project to start a chain without any server account by leveraging the ability of each and every miner in the entire Verus network to merge mine up to 15 chains at a time with the same hash power, another uniquely Verus capability, as is the fully decentralized, cross-chain interoperability protocol that uses a single number at any point in a chain to prove any block, block power, or transaction on the entire chain. PBaaS reserve currencies will allow people to convert Verus to a PBaaS chain's currency and back, similar to how Bancor works for those projects that want to share liquidity with the rest of the Verus ecosystem, also a uniquely Verus capability, but in chains and projects that can remain compatible with the rest of the Komodo ecosystem as well.


[03-Jun-19 11:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Verus is a community project with a Vision and people helping to make it real. It is not a business and does not have an organization behind it charging for its utility. It is a decentralized protocol built by blending Komodo, Zcash, and Verus technologies, and similar to the Komodo philosophy can be used by a project without any central entity being paid. Also, as with Komodo, you can certainly get help from people in the ecosystem and easily provision Komodo notarization and interoperability as well.


[03-Jun-19 11:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <006vl> Thank you for taking your time to provide me with such a detailed answer.

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Besides not having to register an account, one thing that Verus has that Amazon, Microsoft, and Google don't have, is- no middleman. No middleman taking his cut and since Verus is run by miners and stakers and not a centralized authority, pricing should be more competitive and dictated more so by natural market conditions than any centralized "gatekeeper" tasked (or trusted?) with the possession of your sensitive data. I think when Verus is in full swing, companies will soon find that there will be no room left for middlemen to slip their greasy fingers in the jar any longer.ü•á

[04-Jun-19 04:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> No documentation is ready yet, since all the time is put in developing. The reserve currency will enable coin exchange without having to wait for a trade partner. It will dynamically determine the exchange rate via the Bancor protocol.

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @dakgnosis, what I like about Verus' model over permanent ones like rvn for example, people can really squat on names in the same sense, since users will be required to support their chains. Big companies may take some good names and hold on to them but they had better have a good use case (also will prevent spam and poor management of blockchain)

[dscrdvrsc] <CryptoBubbl3> Thanks for everything


[04-Jun-19 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <allbits> K thanks. Best place for documentation and instructions for command line wallet?


[04-Jun-19 11:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @allbits just use "./verus help" and for a specific command "./verus help command", it is based on komodo-cli, but sadly you need to sign-in nowadays just to read the komodo-cli documentation.


[04-Jun-19 12:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <allbits> Yes. Understood. I'm looking for installation documentation tho


[04-Jun-19 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> On the Medium article it explains that you need some test Veruscoins (VRSCTEST)

Are these different from the real ones? I do have some Veruscoins that I could use.

[04-Jun-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> lol


[04-Jun-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> PBaaS is in development on the test chain, VRSCTEST, not the same as the main chain where your regular vrsc are.


[04-Jun-19 12:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> ack ^


[04-Jun-19 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> If you've activated VRSCTEST chain and need some VRSCTEST funds to start, just post your address and there'll be plenty of people who can send funds.


[04-Jun-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @D2D if you want to test PBaaS, I have enough VRSCTEST I can donate (They're not worth anything, because they're not tradable). Just give me your VRSCTEST address once you got the PBAAS preview of Agama running


[04-Jun-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> On the article it suggests looking  for "friendly test-net whales" : )


[04-Jun-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> To test you don't have to be a whale, but one of the PBaaS chains is called WHALECOIN...


[04-Jun-19 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> And the good part is, If you put 1 thread onto merge mining, you'll be a testnet whale in no time


[04-Jun-19 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> And on all chains created.


[04-Jun-19 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Testing is open to anybody who wants to give it a try...


[04-Jun-19 12:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> Yes, just pasting what it said on the article : )
I'm ready, all synced and have a wallet address


[04-Jun-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dakgnosis> @Godballz I guess what I'm concerned with is more so that anyone can take up an important name and basically keep it forever, even as a dead chain. Unless you can reuse names, I could see this as an issue. Kinda like Bitcoin.com being owned by BCash


[04-Jun-19 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I imagined that they'd be reusable after they stopped being paid for but I have no idea, maybe that isn't doable and that is a good point  @dakgnosis


[04-Jun-19 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dakgnosis> The other concern is case sensitivity, because people can get duped into accepting verus coin, rather than Verus coin and end up ripped off (if my understanding is correct about creating blockchain names). These are little things, but preventing some of these phishing vectors is important.


[04-Jun-19 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Good points to think about. At first thought, I likely would have sided against case sensitivity till I read what you wrote. It would be cool if some of the code savvy types had the option to create their own unique wallets to help combat that. Seems there are a lot of ins and outs and that's only what we can see now, I can only imagine the mess of wires and hoses under the hood, most users will never see, that Mike and fellow devs had to sort to get us to here. Its reassuring to know that the project continues to grow.


[04-Jun-19 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I cant wait to see some of the PBaaS use cases we can't even picture yet till we see em in action. This should open up a new level of usability in blockchain tech and I truly cant wait to see how itll be used


[04-Jun-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Thanks, and hopefully, it's not a mess of hoses and wires even under the hood üòÉ there are core protocols constructed from relatively simple and sound cryptographic principles and primitives, including the Merkle Mountain Range with the ability to prove any block and commit to its power that is maintained for every chain, including Verus in the PBaaS system. This is combined with enhanced crypto conditions that allow Komodo style custom consensus transactions to include more data that is part of the transaction and can carry parameters and have flexible destinations that include normal blockchain addresses or combinations of programmatic and normal addresses. All function is actually built over relatively simple and primitive protocols and rules, which essentially employ the same original principles of Nakamoto consensus, only applied across a many blockchain ecosystem.


[04-Jun-19 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Merge mining is achieved with a new, flexible block header format that can carry useful data about each of 15 chains in the same header space otherwise used for an Equihash solution. This also depends on sharing a hash algorithm, which is made easier with a hash algorithm that can be effectively mined on the most available hardware. On that note, @Chris - Monkins1010 LOUD Mining, the community's leading miner developer and developer of a VerusHash 2.0 ARM miner, just posted a pull request that @Asher is looking reviewing/testing now (as will I) and when validated. will enable ARM/RPi compilation and use of Verus nodes. Though I don't know if these are optimized yet for mining, it's exciting to think of inexpensive merge mining and staking chains run by a small Raspberry Pi farm working with faster merge mining cores to mine and notarize many simultaneous chains.

[dscrdvrsc] <Oliver Westbrook> or zcash-params


[04-Jun-19 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> I believe this is because zcash moved their file location so it isn't finding one or two files to download into the params folder

[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @dakgnosis do you use a wif seed or do you use native mode with priv keys / address?


[04-Jun-19 06:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dakgnosis> Native mode


[04-Jun-19 06:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> I would imagine this might not effect native mode using regular priv key / address


[04-Jun-19 06:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Just the light mode wif seed method


[04-Jun-19 06:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> But I am not 100% sure on that


[04-Jun-19 06:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> They proceed to tell you to use the Komodo-cli which is where you get your native mode priv and pub keys from while using agama.


[04-Jun-19 06:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @Infinit0 to get the Zcash params you launch agama select verus native mode and it should prompt to download them


[04-Jun-19 06:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dakgnosis> @That_Guy8 hope so. I'll still feel better if I move my funds though


[04-Jun-19 06:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @dakgnosis Have you used lite mode?


[04-Jun-19 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dakgnosis> I've done so much movements and experimenting with Agama I don't even know lol.


[04-Jun-19 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Well then. If there is a chance you used lite mode I‚Äôd move it. But if you‚Äôve only used native mode then I wouldn‚Äôt bother.

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @gigamesh The version you posted is not the latest version (I'm missing an `a` at the end), so I urge you to upgrade.


[05-Jun-19 12:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @gigamesh no version of the Verus wallet, which includes the version you posted was affected by the issue. I think people are just recommending that you upgrade to the latest, but not due to anything related to that issue. If you were running the non-Verus Agama wallet (not in the same 0.5.6 version series), you should check on the latest from the Komodo discord.

[dscrdvrsc] <Spuddyminer> I don't wanna seem dense, but I have to ask. I've been running both KMD Agama and Verus Agama on same machine. Separate installations. When I look in my appdata, I don't know which wallet created what to be honest...can I still use Verus Agama to save my KMD/PIRATE? Lol


[05-Jun-19 05:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Spuddyminer> Both wallets native mode. It's not clear if native mode KMD addresses were affected, but I want to move funds anyway.

Since PoS is a big part of this project and since lately there are a lot of new faces who might not have owned a stakeable coin before, I figured this would fit in #general just as well as #staking. If it is more appropriate there, I'll be happy to move it. üôÇ

Proof of Stake (PoS): Everything You Need to Know
Proof of Stake (PoS) has become one of the hottest topics in the cryptocurrency world. But what exactly is Proof of Stake? This guide presents a comprehensive answer to that question.

[05-Jun-19 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dakgnosis> A wallet hacker was able to steal 1 million KMD


[05-Jun-19 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <austone> Yeah ‚òπ are there any precautionary steps we, as community, should be taking?


[05-Jun-19 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Our wallet has been tested and is safe


[05-Jun-19 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <LocoMB> it _is_ fucking node.js, so it is only safe until it is targeted...
I guess this incident will create a lot of resentment against javascript, node.js and all the assorted hipster dildos


[05-Jun-19 09:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> JavaScript and Node.js been already a concern in dev communities


[05-Jun-19 09:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> AtomicDEX is built using latest programming languages like Flutter.io and Dart.


[05-Jun-19 09:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> KomodoOceanQT is already like BitcoinCore QT, using C/C++ code as it's core code and it's GUI in QT language.


[05-Jun-19 09:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> That is why these native/core wallets are safer, as the dependency is visible to devs for these wallets.


[05-Jun-19 09:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> node.js modules dependencies are nightmare to track.


[05-Jun-19 09:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> The issue does not affect Verus Agama, but I believe if you import a seed that was made through Verus or any other way into Komodo Agama, the key can get exposed. If you have not used Komodo Agama, you are fine and should not be concerned. If you have, it would be safest to make a new address in Verus Agama, DO NOT import that into Komodo Agama, and send your coins to the new address. After careful review we did confirm that this issue does not affect Verus Agama and is not a weakness in its code or language. We will continue offering Verus Agama (possible rebrand?) and moving it forward in development as a multi-coin solution that will support PBaaS.


[05-Jun-19 09:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <LocoMB> well- the issue is that Komodo Agama was explicitly targeted by upstream injection, which can happen to other distros as well in the future, because of the gazillion dependencies


[05-Jun-19 09:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> yes, rename it from agama, it is like calling it the titanic or hindenburg

[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> oh boy üòê good luck (or whatever good wishes make sense) for everybody involved


[05-Jun-19 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <super55> Been thinking the whole day, what if a country decided to adopt cryptocurrencies and "MILLIONS" of people will use the desktop wallet or even Hardware wallet. So the questions is, will many people will get the same Seed or Private Key?...any solutions to this problem if this can happen? just curious


[05-Jun-19 11:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rhaz01> we will not live to see a day like that unless something catastrophic happens(world wars, etc). Even if crypto gets mass adoption in the current state, gov will probably issue it's own centralized coins where you could reverse a fraudulent payment or stuff like that. And real crypto coins will live alongside.


[05-Jun-19 11:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> @jl777c  is the cli build from your repo subject to the vulnerability? (non-verus version)

[dscrdvrsc] <cesare1985> Hi, I need to create a new wallet on Verus Agama? Or I'm safe with the old wallet?

[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> maybe someone can steal my lost our and zex for me:smiley_abused:


[05-Jun-19 11:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> cli doesnt have any npm module dependency, neither does oceanQT wallet, or magnum, or guarada, or ledger. only the agama that included a poisoned module was vuln


[05-Jun-19 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> but even older versions of the verus windows agama wallet were not vulnerable? I think I created my wallet with that and imported it into my verus cli

[05-Jun-19 09:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @D2D that's basically an approach that would be equivalent to sending all your money to a custom consensus smart transaction and setting rules of how you yourself can access it. You might be able to add safeguards, but still need addresses and keys in order to do that. Once you give up control to the smart contract, you can limit how much damage you can do with your own keys, and how you might change them using other information, which also could limit what damage someone else might be able to do. In any case, if someone gets your keys, which was the issue with Komodo's Agama, they can do anything you can do. If you use some other form of secure information, like biometrics, then eventually, there is still some authorizing information, which if compromised, will be an issue. We will still leave more communication on this to Komodo before in-depth discussion, but we think there are a few things that can be learned from based on what we've seen so far. I wouldn't limit ourselves to a smart contract wallet, and I think if such a code base was attacked in a similar way, it may provide no additional real protection.


[05-Jun-19 09:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> Thanks, it's very interesting to learn about this.


[05-Jun-19 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> Another question I have is, does it make a difference with the hack that happened with Agama if our wallet is encrypted or not?


[05-Jun-19 09:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> In Zelcore's wallet, encryption is by default, but in Agama it has to be done through the settings.


[05-Jun-19 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Infinit0> It is very interesting yet unfortunate for the people who lost money.


[05-Jun-19 09:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Infinit0> I like how communicative the Verus community is. Very transparent. Unlike any other project I've looked at.


[05-Jun-19 09:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> In this case, I don't think it would have mattered if the wallet was encrypted, as I believe the exploit compromised code that would have had access to the encrypted data regardless. I should probably refrain from any more speculation until we hear more from Komodo. We should be patient until that time, but we are definitely learning everything we can from this.


[05-Jun-19 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> OK, that's what I also thought. I want to add that I find the Agama UI not very user-friendly, especially for new people that come into crypto


[05-Jun-19 09:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Infinit0> I just imported my Lite Agama keys/address into Native mode.


[05-Jun-19 09:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Infinit0> Agreed. I love how it has so many settings but it's not intuitive for the average Facebook dummy.


[05-Jun-19 09:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> The sending/receiving section, and also the creation of the wallets section are ok, but all the other settings can be quite confusing and there are no tooltips

[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> Also, is it still ok to launch a blockchain on the Verus testnet using Agama, or better wait until we know more about what happened?


[05-Jun-19 10:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Infinit0> How long does it usually take to download the Verus chain? Took me a day to dl the Monero chain.

[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> Took me a couple of days

[dscrdvrsc] <its> Is there a tutorial how to shield coins from the command line (linux)?


[05-Jun-19 10:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> One more question. I have some Veruscoin in the Verus version of Agama. Does it make it any safer if I move them to a shielded address?


[05-Jun-19 10:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @D2D  There is no issue with creating test chains on test Agama. You don't have to wait. You do currently need to add public nodes to the definition, and you may have to add them to a conf file, but that should be simplified in the next update. You do not have to do anything in your Verus Agama. There was no issue, and unless you used the Komodo Agama on the same machine, your funds should be fine. You don't have to do anything.


[05-Jun-19 10:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> Yes I did use the Agama version on the same machine


[05-Jun-19 10:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Ah, did you load Verus on the Komodo Agama?


[05-Jun-19 10:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> then I downloaded the Verus version, created a new wallett address, and moved the coins there


[05-Jun-19 11:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> I think I might have done so


[05-Jun-19 11:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> OK, so, you sent the coins from Komodo's Agama to the Verus Agama's new address?


[05-Jun-19 11:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> My coins are still all there


[05-Jun-19 11:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> Both ARRR and Veruscoin


[05-Jun-19 11:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I just want to make sure that no one has the private key, which I think can be determined by exact steps. How did you create the new wallets and then send from the old ones?


[05-Jun-19 11:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> I can't remember, I might have opened the Veruscoin wallet and then re-activated the wallet there. Or maybe I activated the Veruscoin wallet in the Agama/Veruscoin version for the first time. I'm not 100% sure, because every time I upgrade Agama instead of replacing the old version I just keep both copies in case anything went wrong


[05-Jun-19 11:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> as long as you never loaded the new wallet on Komodo Agama, you should be OK, but to be sure, I think you would need to rename your wallet files between loading


[05-Jun-19 11:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> Ah OK thanks. How can I do that?


[05-Jun-19 11:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> (rename the files)


[05-Jun-19 11:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> Or I could just send my Veruscoin to the mobile wallet (testflight version) or Pungo


[05-Jun-19 11:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> But still have my ARRR there too


[05-Jun-19 11:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> My KMD, I sent them to the Pungo wallet just a few days ago, and Pungo were not affected by the hack


[05-Jun-19 11:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> But they can't hold ARRR, only Veruscoin and KMD


[05-Jun-19 11:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the right way to do it, and you may want to do it again to be sure would be:
1. Close Komodo Agama
2. Rename the wallet.dat in the ~/.komodo folder to wallet-old.dat and the wallet.dat in the ~/.komodo/VRSC and ~/.komodo/PIRATE folder  (or other komodo family chains) to wallet-old.dat
3. Load Verus Agama wallet. Make sure before you do that all folders of coins do not have a wallet.dat file in them.
4. Activate each coin and create the addresses to send to. Copy them to some editor, so you can send to them
5. Close Verus Agama
6. Rename all wallet.dat files in all directories to wallet-new.dat
7. Rename all wallet-old.dat files in all directories to wallet.dat
8. Load Verus Agama
9. Send all funds to the new addresses on each coin
10. Close Verus Agama
11. Rename all wallet-new.dat files to wallet.dat
12 Load Verus Agama


[05-Jun-19 11:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> basically #1 is not necessary if you are sure that you never load it again. You can do all of the new things with Verus Agama only


[05-Jun-19 11:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> OK great thanks


[05-Jun-19 11:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> Very clear


[05-Jun-19 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> sure. I should have asked if you were on Linux


[05-Jun-19 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> I'm on Mac


[05-Jun-19 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> as long as you can map those wallet directories to Mac folders. can you?


[05-Jun-19 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> have to explore now : )


[05-Jun-19 11:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> basically, each coin has a wallet.dat in a data folder, which has all of your keys and saves the transactions as well


[05-Jun-19 11:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> you need new ones, which will be made automatically if the old one is not present or renamed


[05-Jun-19 11:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> whichever one is named wallet.dat in the right directory when you load is the one that will be activated


[05-Jun-19 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> How do I do these changes to ~/.komodo, through the terminal or just normal search in Finder


[05-Jun-19 11:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> if you assume that the ones you ran Komodo Agama on may be compromised, these steps make new wallets for you and then you load the old ones, which you can do on Verus Agama to send the coins to the new ones, which aren't compromised


[05-Jun-19 11:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I don't really use Mac, but those folders are the locations on Linux. I need to check with someone on Mac. I think they are in a place called Application Support and then with similar directories. Let me check the source.


[05-Jun-19 11:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> It looks like ~/Library/Application Support/Komodo and then below


[05-Jun-19 11:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> what if I move both Verus and ARRR out to Digital Price for example, delete the Veruscoin version of Agama, re-download it, then create two new wallets and send the coins back from Digital Price?


[05-Jun-19 11:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> you don't need to delete the app


[05-Jun-19 11:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> OK


[05-Jun-19 11:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the only one you should delete is Komodo Agama


[05-Jun-19 11:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it is the wallet.dat files that are your actual wallet keys and transactions


[05-Jun-19 11:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> OK. But is it enough to just send  the app from Applications to Trash, or are there more hidden files that need to be deleted?


[05-Jun-19 11:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the app can stay where it is, and when you change the wallet.dat (only when the app is closed), it will be the different wallet


[05-Jun-19 11:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> I mean to delete the old Agama app


[05-Jun-19 11:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> you should not load the Komodo app again, but the wallet.dat can still be accessed by Verus Agama


[05-Jun-19 11:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> ah, yes. it should be ok to just delete the app


[05-Jun-19 11:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> OK thanks


[05-Jun-19 11:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> but please make sure you locate your wallet.dat files


[05-Jun-19 11:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> they hold all your funds, nothing else


[05-Jun-19 11:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> But if I move them to a DigitalPrice wallet, then create a new wallet in Agama (Verus version) I'll be fine


[05-Jun-19 11:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> And after send them back from Digital Price to the new wallet


[05-Jun-19 11:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> As long as I delete the old version of Agama


[05-Jun-19 11:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Only if you create a new wallet.dat


[05-Jun-19 11:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> otherwise, it will be the same wallet and the private keys to at least some of the addresses may be compromised


[05-Jun-19 11:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> so, you would need to delete the old Agama and also the wallet.dat after you are sure DP has your funds


[06-Jun-19 12:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> OK perfect, thanks


[06-Jun-19 12:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> Just realized that deposits for ARRR are still not working on Digital Price


[06-Jun-19 12:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> And withdrawals


[06-Jun-19 12:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> yes, I noticed that too


[06-Jun-19 12:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> what you are trying to do D2D?


[06-Jun-19 12:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ranma103 (Ginasis Mining)> Hey Mike @miketout Is there a reason in the new v6.0 PBaaS wallet you need like 5000 plus verus to be able to send out?


[06-Jun-19 03:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> @grewalsatinder just trying to find a safe home for my ARRR : )


[06-Jun-19 03:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> maybe I'll use Gravex instead, never used before


[06-Jun-19 03:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> üôÇ Verus is good choice then


[06-Jun-19 03:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> yes, but just to get them out, then delete the old Agama, create a new wallet, then send them back to Agama Verus


[06-Jun-19 03:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> give your best try to keep your funds off exchange, and if you couldn't manage it only then go with sending those to some exchange.


[06-Jun-19 03:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SVK_Noko> hi, how old is this coin ?


[06-Jun-19 03:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> with good help you can manage them off exchange fine.


[06-Jun-19 03:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> Would be just temporarily out then in


[06-Jun-19 03:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> you seems confuse. I can may be help.


[06-Jun-19 03:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> I prefer rather than changing the dat files...I'm worried I might do something wrong


[06-Jun-19 04:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> @SVK_Noko bit above a year. i think may (around 24th) was the 1yr anni

[06-Jun-19 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> Here, you have all your native coin files


[06-Jun-19 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> inside Komodo folder you'll fine all your Komodo files as well as your Assetchains Files.


[06-Jun-19 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> PIRATE and VERUS has their own folders inside this Komodo folder in Mac

[06-Jun-19 04:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> I don't have the wallet on my Mac, but this is what it might look like.


[06-Jun-19 04:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> ok


[06-Jun-19 04:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> You can just safely delete the Agama.app from your /Applications.


[06-Jun-19 04:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> Just delete it.


[06-Jun-19 04:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> It will not delete this Komodo folder.


[06-Jun-19 04:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> Then get the Verus Enhanced Agama Wallet.


[06-Jun-19 04:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> Which supports the Pirate coin.


[06-Jun-19 04:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> I guess @Oink can point out which one is best


[06-Jun-19 04:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> Yes I have it


[06-Jun-19 04:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> start that as normal and you'll have access to your PIRTATE/VRSC/KMD and all things via Verus.


[06-Jun-19 04:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> but I think I activated ARRR there at least once, while also having the old agama on my Mac


[06-Jun-19 04:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> Once you have access to your native coins, just create a new address in this Verus Agama Wallet


[06-Jun-19 04:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> Make sure to backup the private key/wif/privkey of that address first.


[06-Jun-19 04:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> Yes


[06-Jun-19 04:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> Then close the wallet, and make sure to take the backup of `wallet.dat` file from each folder you find in Komodo form the screen shot you see


[06-Jun-19 04:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> each folder means Komdo/wallet.dat


[06-Jun-19 04:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> then Komodo/PIRATE/wallet.dat


[06-Jun-19 04:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> then Komodo/VRSC/wallet.dat


[06-Jun-19 04:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> each Assetchain inside of that Komodo folder gets their own folder and has their own independent wallet.dat files.


[06-Jun-19 04:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> make sure to have the backup of each of them.


[06-Jun-19 04:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> save then on some external USB etc or wherever you feel safer.


[06-Jun-19 04:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> Then restart the Verus Agama Wallet and send all the funds to that new address.


[06-Jun-19 04:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> Since you are using the Native wallets, which is THE BEST CHOICE!, you should keep a habit of keeping the backup of the wallet.dat files


[06-Jun-19 04:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> OK


[06-Jun-19 04:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> make that habit of always taking the backup of the wallet.dat file before you send funds from it.
And once after sending funds from it.


[06-Jun-19 04:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> yes good idea


[06-Jun-19 04:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> name that backup with the name of date/time so you have the backups consistent.


[06-Jun-19 04:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> Don't delete old backjps


[06-Jun-19 04:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> backups*


[06-Jun-19 04:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> keep them ALL.


[06-Jun-19 04:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> To interject: If you plan to use coins in native mode: Agama 0.5.6a will be best


[06-Jun-19 04:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> Be safer and always prefer to use Native mode for your all coins as much possible.


[06-Jun-19 04:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> yes that's what I have here


[06-Jun-19 04:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> 0.5.6a


[06-Jun-19 04:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> I hope those screenshots might be helpful.


[06-Jun-19 04:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> yes very helpful, thanks a lot!


[06-Jun-19 04:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> no worries mate.


[06-Jun-19 04:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> stay safer with with your funds üôÇ


[06-Jun-19 04:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> I don't understand something


[06-Jun-19 04:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> When I go to Settings - Wallet.dat keys


[06-Jun-19 04:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> If I press: "Get keys"


[06-Jun-19 04:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> I don't know the internals of the Agama Wallets. I have been a `cli` guy üòÑ


[06-Jun-19 04:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> @Oink can help


[06-Jun-19 04:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> It says:


[06-Jun-19 04:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> Found 79 Keys


[06-Jun-19 04:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> that probably means your wallet.dat has 79 addresses in it? ü§î


[06-Jun-19 04:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> And it gives me a whole list of addresses and each address has a WIF


[06-Jun-19 04:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Copy them all... Weed them out later


[06-Jun-19 04:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> But what are they I don't understand


[06-Jun-19 04:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> @Oink doesn't Verus agama provides access to command line in its UI?


[06-Jun-19 04:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> in Komodo Agama, it had the option to drop down menu for the address which shows the funds and then do the dumpprivkey with copy option.


[06-Jun-19 04:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yes, it does... Let me look up the path fr that real quick


[06-Jun-19 04:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> that helped users to make sure to copy that address's wif backup.


[06-Jun-19 04:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> `Agama-win32-x64\resources\app\assets\bin\win64\verusd\`


[06-Jun-19 04:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> @D2D but in any case, if you couldn't figure out how to backup the address wif/privkey backups, just follow my advice of taking backup of wallet.dat files preiodically.


[06-Jun-19 04:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> if you follow that, you should be fine with that too


[06-Jun-19 04:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Location of `Agama-win32-x64` depends on twhere the user dumped it.


[06-Jun-19 04:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> I guess he's using Mac


[06-Jun-19 04:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> so it must be /Applications/Verus.app/Resources .... etc


[06-Jun-19 04:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> Yes I am, and I found how to retrieve the key now


[06-Jun-19 04:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> good üëç


[06-Jun-19 04:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> I also liked Verus Mobile wallet, if you want to try that.


[06-Jun-19 05:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> But no ARRR there yet

[06-Jun-19 05:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> OK so thanks to the screenshots from @grewalsatinder I managed to follow the instruction above from @miketout


[06-Jun-19 05:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> üôÇ üëç


[06-Jun-19 05:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> So I managed to change wallet.dat to wallet-old.dat in all folders


[06-Jun-19 05:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> BUT


[06-Jun-19 05:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> I just realised that I have an extra dat wallet with some numbers, and I think that's from importing KMD into Zelcore


[06-Jun-19 05:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> (from the old Agama wallet, I did that recently)


[06-Jun-19 05:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> maybe 2 weeks ago


[06-Jun-19 05:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> if you rename your existing wallet.dat to something else, there won't be any existing wallet.dat.
and then when you will start a native mode coin, it will check if there is wallet.dat file or not. if not, it will create a new one for you.


[06-Jun-19 05:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> I don't really need it as my KMD are on another wallet now


[06-Jun-19 05:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> make a *copy* of your existing wallet.dat file and then use Verus Agama.


[06-Jun-19 05:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> I think I'll delete the file created by Zelcore


[06-Jun-19 05:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> just in case it's vulnerable


[06-Jun-19 05:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> I don't know anything about zelcore.


[06-Jun-19 05:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> They let you import another wallet by using the keys


[06-Jun-19 05:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> for native mode always have backups of your wallet.dat which holds the funds.


[06-Jun-19 05:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> And I remember Zelcore asked if I wanted to encrypt it and I clicked yes


[06-Jun-19 05:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> maybe somebody here know about zelcore to help you then.


[06-Jun-19 05:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> anyway it's empty, no KMD there


[06-Jun-19 05:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> so no risk really


[06-Jun-19 06:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> How do you backup the wallet.dat? 
Is renaming it to wallet-old.dat not a form of backup?


[06-Jun-19 06:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yes, it is


[06-Jun-19 06:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> OK


[06-Jun-19 06:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> But need to save it to an external device to be safer then


[06-Jun-19 06:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Just not in a safe place üòá


[06-Jun-19 06:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> Do I just copy and paste it?


[06-Jun-19 06:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Indeed... external drive


[06-Jun-19 06:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Indeed


[06-Jun-19 06:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> OK thanks


[06-Jun-19 06:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Make sure to make directories for them... else you‚Äôll keep overwriting them


[06-Jun-19 06:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> Directories?


[06-Jun-19 06:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> And you‚Äôll have 1 correct wallet left


[06-Jun-19 06:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Folders... make a Verus folder, Komodo folder etc... dump the wallet-old.dat in their respective folders


[06-Jun-19 06:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> ah OK folder yes


[06-Jun-19 06:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> So now I re-opened the Agama (Verus version)


[06-Jun-19 06:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> And after it's all synced, it says my balance is zero


[06-Jun-19 06:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> now I import the key?


[06-Jun-19 06:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> New wallet, no transactions... so you‚Äôll need to import the key indeed

[06-Jun-19 06:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Infinit0> I didn't know KMD hacked itself.


[06-Jun-19 06:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> So is it important to save the keys + wallet.dat for each coin? I always thought it was enough to save the Agama wallet seed


[06-Jun-19 06:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Better safe than sorry... Digital storage may become corrupt. Personally I have all my WIFs and seeds on paper in my safe.


[06-Jun-19 06:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> And of coarse daily backups of my wallet.dat files


[06-Jun-19 06:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> Wow, daily


[06-Jun-19 06:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> Good to learn all this to be extra safe

[06-Jun-19 07:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> My backup doesn‚Äôt do just a copy.... it encrypts too... so if anybody gets his hands on the backups, they‚Äôll first have to decrypt them, among other things....


[06-Jun-19 07:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But that‚Äôs all useless if somebody gains access to the live wallet.dat

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Infinit0 laminated paper delaminates when exposed to moist over long periods of time, especially if the laminated layers are stressed, like when rolling up..., tin cans tend to rot away over time... anyone with an RFID reader can get a signal on the gps trackers... but wouldn‚Äôt any signal be blocked by the tin can (Faradays cage)

[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> Is their a way to create a privacy coin, without exploits, by limiting the design? This includes any aspect of the coin--wallets, etc....


[06-Jun-19 06:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> This isn't a criticism bc of recent events...
It just seems like widespread adoption requires a privacy project, to open itself up more to exploits..


[06-Jun-19 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @10 (Not Giving away Eth) not sure what you mean... we have been devoid of exploits so far, while we know that it is a risk for any project whatsoever, we work hard to stay on top of things and to respond quickly if something is ever discovered. We also use and develop leading solutions to help keep it that way. do you have any particular exploit you're concerned about? are you referring to the one that hit Komodo Agama but not Verus Agama? Earlier Zcash sprout issues that we fixed before anyone else besides Zcash, or the 51% attacks that Verus is resistant to in multiple ways? Maybe fake stake or nothing at stake attacks that we have solutions for? Please let us know if there's a kind of exploit you feel would be something we need to look into related to our privacy capability or the zero knowledge support on PBaaS chains. I'm not aware of any weakness in those areas regarding Verus, but we are always looking üòÉ


[06-Jun-19 07:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> Mike, I never said anything of the sort.
It wasn't directed towards any project.
It was a general question, in general discussion.

I know, that projects like XMR & not until of very recent ZEC, had a mobile wallet. 
Why that is, I'm not one hundred percent sure.
I'm not an expert, nor am I a developer.
But it does seem that, in most things privacy tech related, that less can be better.


[06-Jun-19 07:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> This is a general privacy tech related comment, not directed at Verus, or Komodo or any privacy project.

I did find myself thinking about PBaaS & if it would be possible, to add another level of privacy, to a chain... Not that Verus doesn't offer the Gold Standard, in crypto... It was just a thought

[06-Jun-19 07:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Akira X> why do i need to generate a new address?


[06-Jun-19 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> if your verus address has never been used in the affected agama wallet, then it's fine @Akira X


[06-Jun-19 07:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @10 (Not Giving away Eth) There's an Albert Einstein quote, "things should be as simple as possible, but not simpler", that I think applies. There are many things to achieve with blockchain, and if it is pure privacy and sending of amounts only, you can achieve that most simply without other core capabilities. When you start to want other capabilities, like dapps, or staking, or cross-chain operations, or other advanced features, a provably private system may require more complexity, but it should still be kept as simple as possible, I believe. I don't think that means open to more exploits, but I may misunderstand what you mean.


[06-Jun-19 08:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> No, you understood me correctly.


[06-Jun-19 08:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Akira X> Define being used there


[06-Jun-19 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Akira X> I mainly use mobile agama


[06-Jun-19 08:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Akira X> I'm downloading verus 6


[06-Jun-19 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Akira X> But extracting takes awhile


[06-Jun-19 08:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> meaning you access the address using  desktop agama


[06-Jun-19 08:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Akira X> ok


[06-Jun-19 08:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Akira X> im sending to my other verus address


[06-Jun-19 08:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Akira X> not been used there


[06-Jun-19 08:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Akira X> but im having an issue sending T adddresses


[06-Jun-19 08:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Akira X> and im having an issue with btch


[06-Jun-19 09:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Akira X there is an update w/ more coins and K64 support on the way, though it should work now. The only wallet that could have compromised an address that would have been used with it is desktop Komodo Agama wallet from the last few months. Mobile wallets don‚Äôt have the issue, and neither does Verus Agama desktop. You might already know that, but just for clarity.


[06-Jun-19 09:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Akira X> im not getting that from other people


[07-Jun-19 06:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> the fact that Verus vs of Agama was ano affected is because you decided not to use npm's or just by accident? :smiley_abused:


[07-Jun-19 06:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Our software developers are pretty strict where it comes to safety, so I think we may rule luck out of the equasion... If it was by accident, Agama 0.6.x would have been suffering from it too


[07-Jun-19 09:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> How did I miss we¬¥re on our third exchange, Crypto-bridge - congrats Verus! 
https://wallet.crypto-bridge.org/market/BRIDGE.VRSC_BRIDGE.BTC


[07-Jun-19 09:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Actually we‚Äôre on Digital Price, Stexx, Crypto-Bridge and AAcoin... And for OTC trades we‚Äôre listed at Barterlly.


[07-Jun-19 10:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Oink We¬¥ll need another CMC exchange to be listed on CMC, just STEX is on CMC of those you mentioned.


[07-Jun-19 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yes, we do... check #marketing I did fill out some applications last week


[07-Jun-19 10:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> Probably worth considering https://graviex.net too as they are on CMC and got quite a bit of ARRR flows (EDIT: If it hasn't already been entered)

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> They're on my list. IIRC I don't have all the data they require


[07-Jun-19 10:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> ah


[07-Jun-19 10:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Good call, though


[07-Jun-19 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> I would try Crex 24, they seem open to small coins.


[07-Jun-19 10:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i'd agree


[07-Jun-19 10:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> I can¬¥t fill the form myself, probably better with a dev.


[07-Jun-19 10:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> tradesatoshi __may__ be another option


[07-Jun-19 10:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but they ask ridiculously high fees for some coins


[07-Jun-19 10:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> thats why __may__ be


[07-Jun-19 10:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Don't call me a dev... You'll insult the dev's by doing so... üòÇ


[07-Jun-19 10:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Another good one, I¬¥ve actually been looking at that too, was to be my second choice. I¬¥ve used Satoshi for trading HUSH ,I think, or at least noted it as a potential HUSH trading platform. Think it¬¥s one of the HUSH exchanges with the most volume. EDIT: No, I was wrong , checked it and it is Graviex that has the highest volume for HUSH.

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @MrCryptoCash-AcedPoker.io , already posted in #community-support by @FishyGuts , but thanks for the heads up!


[07-Jun-19 11:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I thought the point of paying for the crypto-bridge listing was to have the 2nd CMC listed exchange?


[07-Jun-19 12:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Afaik Cryptopia has been payed, but never a listing and now out of business... if we get a listing on another exchange that‚Äôs on CoinMarketCap, we can get listed there too, which would hugely increase our visibility


[07-Jun-19 12:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Yes, wasn't crypto-bridge supposed to take that place?


[07-Jun-19 12:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Stex and CB.


[07-Jun-19 12:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we have Stex and CB. not many people use them


[07-Jun-19 12:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we applied to CMC, and they said to point them to a CMC listed exchange that gets volume. DP volume would be fine, but it's not on CMC listed exchanges


[07-Jun-19 12:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Strike that-they are on CMC, just without the "-" üòÑ


[07-Jun-19 12:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Then we just need to increase the VRSC volume on both the STEX and CryptoBridge exchanges


[07-Jun-19 12:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Crypto-Bridge did a few days of tweeting without any prompting to take a look at Verus. the trading on CB didn't really pickup from that


[07-Jun-19 12:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> everyone who uses DP seems to stay there, and that's where reasonable trading is


[07-Jun-19 12:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Perhaps someone will do some arbitrage trading, VRSC seems cheaper there.


[07-Jun-19 12:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I do some trades on Stex, but it's pretty annoying. Always some bot jumping 1 sat ahead


[07-Jun-19 12:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> AACoin has even been stable for quite some time, turned off their bots in response to the community and has staking, but people still use DP


[07-Jun-19 12:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> DP has definitely been the best exchange in terms of VRSC trading


[07-Jun-19 12:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> they're not CMC though


[07-Jun-19 12:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> aacoin market is dead. Been 1 bid for 8 sats for a while now


[07-Jun-19 12:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> yeah


[07-Jun-19 12:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I don't think anyone trusts them any longer


[07-Jun-19 12:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i remember aacoin having deep issues with their staking pool before


[07-Jun-19 12:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it seems, but they actually didn't do anything themselves that was wrong


[07-Jun-19 12:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it was when the daemon deprecated and they hadn't upgraded. that was an error


[07-Jun-19 12:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Their lack of support, lengthy withdrawal times, disabling the wallet, staking problems....


[07-Jun-19 12:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> yes


[07-Jun-19 12:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> TradeOgre should be within reach. (?)


[07-Jun-19 12:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> not as on top of it, but all understandable


[07-Jun-19 12:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I found numerous typos and dead links on their site. Small things like that add up


[07-Jun-19 12:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> not to say it's ok


[07-Jun-19 12:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I pointed out gate.io lists for free months and months ago, but I seemed to be ignored


[07-Jun-19 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I think the path of least resistance to CMC is DP getting listed eventually


[07-Jun-19 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> We haven't heard yet from TradeOgre on the recent app. @FishyGuts said people kept asking them about ARRR and then they finally integrated quickly. I can't provide any details, but there is a seemingly pretty nice exchange coming online soon that will have a collection of very nice projects/cryptos with Verus among them.


[07-Jun-19 12:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Or do what everyone else does and do some wash trading


[07-Jun-19 12:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> There's really a lot to do, and mostly I focus on development. Getting on all small exchanges can take a lot of time and isn't always the right place to put resources. I don't remember that, but it's never about someone wanting to ignore, I think. Lots of small exchanges, pumps, or even a primary focus on the price as the priority just isn't Verus.


[07-Jun-19 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> gate.io is not a small exchange


[07-Jun-19 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Then either it wasn't seen or we may even have followed up. I don't know.


[07-Jun-19 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> It's magnitudes more popular than CB, or STEX


[07-Jun-19 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i think someone actually did


[07-Jun-19 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> looking at them now


[07-Jun-19 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> but i'm not sure


[07-Jun-19 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> IMO, I don‚Äôt want more low volume exchanges. It only raises questions and concerns. Marketing should be focused on by all of us, then exchanges will come by themselves as well as volume due to recognition.


[07-Jun-19 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Gate looks like a good option.


[07-Jun-19 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Everyone was caught up in the CB talk


[07-Jun-19 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> not low volume


[07-Jun-19 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> @zpajk that is what I have been saying every time this conversation comes up


[07-Jun-19 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Adding more low tier/low volume exchanges will just make it look like a shitcoin


[07-Jun-19 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Yet, __if__ a large volume exchange would pick us up then that would drive marketing instead.


[07-Jun-19 12:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BigCat45> For that they need to see high volume => fees


[07-Jun-19 12:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> gate.io is #64/65 rank on CMC


[07-Jun-19 12:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> But it won't really matter if people don't trade


[07-Jun-19 12:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BigCat45> DP would be enough, in the end, all they want is their fees


[07-Jun-19 12:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> btw, @miketout, I don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre the only one using the Verus twitter, but you‚Äôre doing a great job if so! üòÉ


[07-Jun-19 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Which is why I say DP getting on cmc is the most seamless way for VRSC to get on there too


[07-Jun-19 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we should be able to put in an app


[07-Jun-19 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @zpajk not the only one, but sometimes üòÉ thanks!


[07-Jun-19 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> With the recent large increase of volume on DP I don't see why they wouldn't be added sooner than later


[07-Jun-19 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Patrick Crypto I agree with that


[07-Jun-19 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @zpajk got my account reactivated yesterday!!! So I'm on it again


[07-Jun-19 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Unless the increase is just the hacker selling all their stolen KMD


[07-Jun-19 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it doesn't look like that kind of increase, and I'd imagine they'd want to be further away from the community


[07-Jun-19 12:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> ahahah no it definitely is not enough to cover 1m KMD


[07-Jun-19 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BigCat45> Is that how much was stolen?


[07-Jun-19 12:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> It's a bit unclear, but it seemed like that is what DP was saying was missing from their kmd cold storage?


[07-Jun-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BigCat45> " wallet sent out 423667.07901171"


[07-Jun-19 12:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> So the 50k was missing? I thought they were saying that is what was on their ledger


[07-Jun-19 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> 423k


[07-Jun-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> @miketout  I'm not sure if you would agree with me on this. But I believe the crypto community of today, or that of 6 years ago, can attribute it's major setbacks to one party---the exchanges ... They always seem to be the winner, in crypto. Their outrageous listing fees, trading fees & overall lack of security & or any type of insurance for funds on the exchange.

And when I started reading about Atomic Swaps, I was hooked w/KMD. But it has never really materialized.
Do you think this is something that Verus would be interested, in doing?


[07-Jun-19 04:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> Or a (Mobile v Desktop) DEX w/OTC?

It never hurts to ask. ü§ôü§ô:smiley_abused:

[07-Jun-19 08:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @10 (Not Giving away Eth) 2 things... There is a new decentralized dex for Komodo, and through I haven't used the new one, I'm hopeful. As far as on-chain conversions, we are doing reserve currencies and shared liquidity as a PBaaS liquidity sharing and exchange solution. We expect to still have Verus and other PBaaS coins traded through exchanges and dexes, but with reserve conversion, reserve currencies will share liquidity through cross-chain, decentralized conversions.
@Pistol | verus.wattpool.net looks nice! I've added you to the pool operators channel in case you want to talk to people there.


[07-Jun-19 08:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <dakgnosis> Over what medium do you envision users accessing Verus reserve currencies? Would it be a website, GUI, or in an exchange format? Just curious what your vision for this is. @miketout


[07-Jun-19 08:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ranma103 (Ginasis Mining)> Hey @miketout will a upgrade of the PBaaS agama have all these new coins added in the next update?


[07-Jun-19 08:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @dakgnosis reserve currencies will work with the usual Verus wallets and will be able to be converted in the wallet from one to another or Verus.


[07-Jun-19 08:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Ranma103 (Ginasis Mining) yes


[07-Jun-19 08:36 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Since it works as a general example, I hope it's alright to post this here, but for anyone else, along with myself, who would like to get a better understanding of how liquid tokens work, I found these articles useful. Good for getting at least a rough understanding. 
I think someone might have linked me the first one at some point actually, but I found the descriptions and examples very handy on getting a good grasp of the concept but if this post is in the wrong place or should be removed I'd be happy to.

[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> How can we get people to trade Verus on STEX and Crypto-Bridge more so that we get listed on CoinMarketCap.com ? Being visible on CMC would be great for marketing. Verus is now on two CMC exchanges, but we need some more trading volume on those before sending in a coin listing submission form to CMC, see this link for more info on CMC listing requirements:

[08-Jun-19 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> @Crupti IMO, I think CMC has to come naturally, for Verus. Every project is different. And some value more aspects than others. 
I know that I personally, when I was very active with Verus, tried to make a case for directing more energy & effort to get listed on CMC. Because it is really the community standard, like BitcoinTalk is for announcing new or newer projects---CMC provides users w/historical price data, current price data, exchanges listings, token supply data, etc ..  It provides some degree of financial legitimiatcy, for new traders to look to, when researching a new project.. Most importantly, it would provide a new wave of community members.

Do you know the required volume & for what period of time? I've got a few things in mind.


[08-Jun-19 03:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @10 (Not Giving away Eth) Only what the CMC "(3) Tips on getting your listing added" says: _"We evaluate many other factors besides the basic criteria when deciding to add a new listing. These factors include but are not limited to: ... -Trading Volume ‚Äì Trading volume and liquidity help with establishing a market price for users to acquire and sell cryptocurrencies..."_

[dscrdvrsc] <ABK> What‚Äôs the new Komodo dex called?


[08-Jun-19 07:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mykos> @Crupti  i been trying to get our coin listed on cmc.. denied the first time they replied back and now are considering more info to get us listed. i think we should petition them because the problem is they are using centralized exchanges to list us


[08-Jun-19 07:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mykos> and i don't think that's a good model


[08-Jun-19 07:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mykos> i think they should use of course liquidity but the overall impact the community and the project will have on the project itself...but centralized exchanges are the direct opposite of what many of us think the crypto space should be about


[08-Jun-19 07:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mykos> so honestly i don't even think they should be a factor


[08-Jun-19 07:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mykos> if your project is unique as i understand it now cmc can list you. so it's not just based on volume and liquidity. It's also based on the uniqueness of the project and how it impacts the space


[08-Jun-19 07:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Maybe we could bombard them with requests? I've sent an email myself but if a good amount of people feel it is worth doing, maybe a more focused community effort might sway them

[08-Jun-19 07:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> So it might work against Verus if we send a lot of emails, donno though, might help. @Godballz Had the same idea until I saw the warning in their listing criteria üòÑ

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I agree though that we should always use the appropriate channels dictated by them themselves.


[08-Jun-19 07:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Godballz  I have a small suggestion, that might help somewhat in getting Stex and CB volume.


[08-Jun-19 07:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Interested. They could use that and in turn it'd help us prove volume


[08-Jun-19 07:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Today on the Verus homepage there is no "Buy Verus Here" link like many others have, we should have such a link imo where we list all the exchanges, starting with Stex and DB as those have the least volume right now.


[08-Jun-19 08:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Wonder if @Oink is around?


[08-Jun-19 08:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> First time Verus buyers are bound to use the web page to look for exchanges first, so we¬¥ll use the homepage to market those two exchanges first as those have the least volume.


[08-Jun-19 08:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I like that idea. Sometimes little things like that can have a big impact


[08-Jun-19 08:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I haven't looked at how it's set up in a while but there may be a specific look for the first thing people see but maybe there is a way to have both?

[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> Would it be possible to have the exchanges listed on the front page, be links to my not yet created VerusPay store? I'm not making demands, only asking  @Oink


[08-Jun-19 12:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Crupti @10 (Not Giving away Eth)  The option to move the exchange listing is worth considering. Keep in mind it is already prominent at the top of the ‚Äò**Get Verus**‚Äô Page for exactly that purpose, above the mining software and pools. It feels like a logical place to me. Would a different place on the website generate more trades on the exchanges, I wonder.
Links to VerusPay stores have come up before. I‚Äôm positive about it, haven‚Äôt given it much thought yet if, where and how to implement it on the website.

I feel we need build our media efforts towards the release of PBaaS by showing what we‚Äôre capable of at this moment. I‚Äôve had a lot of questions in DM the past couple of days about specifically merge mining and PBaaS and the general conclusion was that those persons had to get some VRSC, as investment or as start capital for a chain.
The fact that out Agama wallet was not vulnerable where the Komodo Agama wallet was and the effort of this community to release 0.5.7 and support the people using it as new replacement wallet, has earned us a lot of goodwill in the entire Komodo ecosystem and a lot of visibility as a result. How unfortunate the cause may be, it actually helps our visibility and a lot more people heard of us now.

[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> @Oink I'm sorry, Oink. I was just making a joke, about a link to my VerusPay store. I thought you'd catch that lol.


[08-Jun-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> Team Pictures in crypto, are not mandatory.
There are safety issues involved with it.


[08-Jun-19 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> This does seem to be a personal preference to some. @Oink brings up a good point in that we shouldn't lose focus. The only thing I have to say on verification of developers at this point in the project is similar to to what  @0x03. The constant work being pushed out regularly should be all the verification on the developers work ethics and the cooperation with other communities is a testament to their desire to make positive change to benefit us all. Mike has a long list of public contributions that are easily found. If anything, here, we should respect people's privacy.
I'm not saying this isn't valuable to some and maybe some may choose to add more info at some point, I'm only saying that a full scale merge mineable ecosystem is now coming to fruition and at this point it might be useful to stay focused on the things that are important to everyone.


[08-Jun-19 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @10 (Not Giving away Eth) Sorry, didn't get it, but if people can see what the can do with verus except hodling and trading on exchange, that could help in promoting Verus


[08-Jun-19 12:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> What would that matter anyways? 
Most projects have multiple developers & they fail to have working products, a year into their project. 
We know and we communicate, with Mike Toutonghi.
If he feels it is better for him to handle all things dev team related, he has earned that right.


[08-Jun-19 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> He is open, transparent and readily accessible for discussion on all things Verus related.


[08-Jun-19 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> I came here in August 18.
And I've not once has a issue related to the development team. Mike gets an A+, in
my book, for coordinating all of that and 
doing it successfully.


[08-Jun-19 12:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> @Mining Spec Was there a specific project related question, or issue you had?


[08-Jun-19 12:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> This is an open community and we welcome all questions and comments


[08-Jun-19 12:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> I think the website is great, got all the stuff there that coins normally have üòÉ


[08-Jun-19 12:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> I was just throwing out some ideas about how we could get Verus CMC listed by getting more Verus volume on Stex and Crypto-Bridge üòÉ Listing these two exchanges first on the frontpage _could_ make a small difference, but probably not a whole lot.


[08-Jun-19 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> Well, actually I think this is a better strategy


[08-Jun-19 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> Most traffic directed to DP


[08-Jun-19 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> We have over 1 BTC vol right now


[08-Jun-19 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> We need around $10k daily volume there


[08-Jun-19 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> Then as for the other 2 exchanges


[08-Jun-19 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> We need to help build the order book, if possible


[08-Jun-19 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Getting the word out there that there _are_ other exchanges than DP would help I think, just how to best go about it I¬¥m not sure of.


[08-Jun-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> The price difference between them and DP, is too much, and not good.


[08-Jun-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> @Crupti Well we need 1 really solid exchange to show good volume


[08-Jun-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> Not 3 exchanges, with a small to mid average


[08-Jun-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> We need $10k daily, from one exchange of 3


[08-Jun-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> To show volume


[08-Jun-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @10 (Not Giving away Eth) If there is a big price difference then people can earn money with arbitrage trading, should fix itself.


[08-Jun-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> $10k, if the CMC requirement


[08-Jun-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> That hurts our case


[08-Jun-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> They will look at all 3..


[08-Jun-19 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> See, if the two that don't have high volume, do they offer a similar price, to that of the top Verus market on DP


[08-Jun-19 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> You posted the requirements here


[08-Jun-19 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> If Verus is cheap on one exchange, people would buy it there, transfer it to another exchange, and immidiately sell it for a big profit.


[08-Jun-19 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That would increase volume


[08-Jun-19 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But the volumes on DP are daily 1-3 BTC (including KMD trades) on the other ones as low as a couple of $


[08-Jun-19 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> You mean CryptoBridge and Stex?


[08-Jun-19 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> So it's safe to say our volume is not a manipulated one


[08-Jun-19 01:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> But it is not healthy


[08-Jun-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> The prices are off


[08-Jun-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> By quite a bit lol


[08-Jun-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> We have an unverified market on CB


[08-Jun-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Because the spread is high due to low volume


[08-Jun-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> This is what I said.


[08-Jun-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> I'm saying we need to try to address it.


[08-Jun-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> At least when we send in the application to CMC


[08-Jun-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> It's frustrating that DP coin is on CMC, but the exchange isn't


[08-Jun-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> API is the issue


[08-Jun-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I've looked at that before... I don't have all the info and I'm not prepared to fill in other peoples email addresses and names....


[08-Jun-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> This coin only had $5k the day it was listed on CMC

[08-Jun-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> So here is what I think could be a solution ..


[08-Jun-19 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> Instead of being pissed about the vol requirements or whatever other bs it is, stopping us from being listed on CMC


[08-Jun-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> Could we, as the community, try to pool a fund from community members that have been here since the beginning, and make the order books look better, on those 2 exchanges?


[08-Jun-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> Because we likely will not be getting a new exchange listing anytime soon.


[08-Jun-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> We should just address the CMC issue and get it resolved somehow.


[08-Jun-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Wash trading? That only creates a misleading market.


[08-Jun-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> No no no


[08-Jun-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> Did I say wash trading?


[08-Jun-19 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> I liked when it was possible to buy larger quantities on the onboarding page. Makes buying at a more or less stable price easier there, then more people might buy and send to the exchanges


[08-Jun-19 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> Making sure that competetive priced Verus are listed on all 3 exchanges, is not wash trading.


[08-Jun-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> We are community members trying to ensure that the community has options, and fairly priced ones, too


[08-Jun-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Creating more Verus utility would also make the volume go up. PBaaS should help with that.


[08-Jun-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <D2D> This page I mean, it used the be possible to buy 777 in one go

[08-Jun-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> Okay. I am speaking about for a short term period of a few weeks


[08-Jun-19 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> While they review the volume etc..


[08-Jun-19 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> Not months, or several weeks...
1 to 2 weeks


[08-Jun-19 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> What are some other solutions?


[08-Jun-19 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> I think we¬¥ll just have to make more utility of Verus and market it more. There are ways of getting marketed by YT¬¥bers and other influencers.


[08-Jun-19 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> Who will do those interviews?


[08-Jun-19 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> Dev team is busy


[08-Jun-19 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> It does¬¥nt have to be interviews per say, we could write a press release and put it on PR News Web or one of those PR websites, then also proactively send the news releases to influencers.


[08-Jun-19 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> They are selective in what they mention, for their own reasons.


[08-Jun-19 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> Usually monetary ones.


[08-Jun-19 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> That¬¥s how companies market themselves, and Verus is kindof like a community company of sorts.


[08-Jun-19 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> Really?


[08-Jun-19 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> Verus is willing to pay for YTers to put out news?


[08-Jun-19 01:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> I can promise you this---whatever we want to happen, CMC or to Market, it will require hard work on the communities behalf.


[08-Jun-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> There is no simple solution.


[08-Jun-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> You only pay for the press release listing, but if no magazines etc picks up then you have to send the press release to influensers asf  - not all of them charge money for mentioning stuff.


[08-Jun-19 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> You presented an issue of Volume.
I mentioned a way to address volume.
And the topic changed to focusing on being a utility


[08-Jun-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Well, my reasoning is that the more utility a coin has the more people will use the coin, and as a consequence the trade volume will increase - I might be way off, but it just felt as a natural connection to me somehow.


[08-Jun-19 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> I spoke with Pirate & they mentioned a few solutions. 
But they just aren't compatible with us.

[08-Jun-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763

[08-Jun-19 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> I¬¥m guessing influencers that have reported on Komodo ecosystem and ZCash ecosystem coins before are low hanging fruits.


[08-Jun-19 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> Lol


[08-Jun-19 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> I¬¥ve marketed products before, and we tried to reach out to reporters that had previous stories with related products. They were more likely to pick up the story as they had some pre-knowledge about the vertical.


[08-Jun-19 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> I have a friend w/50k subscribers..
A friend that runs a popular Crypto newsletter & website


[08-Jun-19 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Nice


[08-Jun-19 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> It would be marketing gold if we would get an influenser with the right kind of audience to talk about Verus.


[08-Jun-19 01:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> If you publish a press release you also can get professional media¬¥s attention - suddenly you have Mike on Bloomberg Technology talking about PBaaS üòÑ Or on TechCrunch.


[08-Jun-19 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> But, it is very hard to get noticed, even with a well-written press release. If you REALLY want to get noticed by the big tech media we¬¥ll have to pay a professional media company - they¬¥ll write the story and use their network to get it published in notable media outlets like TV and the big tech magazines online. That¬¥s how the big boys (and gals) do it in tech. But it can cost a lot of money.


[08-Jun-19 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'm honestly surprised that hasn't already happened, you know if they really did research and were truly impartial..


[08-Jun-19 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I know if that were my thing I'd be looking for up and coming strong projects with cutting edge tech


[08-Jun-19 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Although, Verus is still a youngin relatively speaking so there's always a hood chance that happens, especially with upcoming main net and a functional test net


[08-Jun-19 03:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Godballz It could very much happen that an influencer would just stumble upon Verus, but as a PBaaS first-mover it¬¥s probably smart to also do some active marketing by writing a nice/professional press release text and send it to influencers and relevant news outlets imo.

[dscrdvrsc] <Kaizen üëâüèª Crypto-Mob.com> I decided to create I collection for your project on my website. Let me know what you think


[09-Jun-19 12:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Kaizen üëâüèª Crypto-Mob.com great initiative. Can I pay with Verus?


[09-Jun-19 01:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Kaizen üëâüèª Crypto-Mob.com, dug what you did for arrr and a few other projects. Glad you made some sweet Verus merch so we can represent! Just grabbed a tee, can't wait. Thanks! üòÑ


[09-Jun-19 01:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I can't wait till it gets here. In my head, I imagine walking around wearing it and then bumping into another fellow member like it's fight club or something. ü§º üòÇ

[09-Jun-19 02:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> was about to DL wallet ,am now nervous


[09-Jun-19 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Let me check real quick.


[09-Jun-19 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> landing page is ok, but then links dont seem to work


[09-Jun-19 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Which wallet were you trying?


[09-Jun-19 02:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> ok seems better now


[09-Jun-19 02:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> that was weird though


[09-Jun-19 02:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I didn't do anything (yet)


[09-Jun-19 02:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> maaaybe my browser but dont think so


[09-Jun-19 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> or maybe site is getting lots of traffic?


[09-Jun-19 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I'll check the services, just to be sure...


[09-Jun-19 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> thanks


[09-Jun-19 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Services on the site all OK... It may be related to Github, where the files reside... We have no control over that


[09-Jun-19 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> after this Agama hack i suddenly became concerned the Verus website was getting hacked, and the hacker was uploading a malicious wallet for users to DL


[09-Jun-19 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> obv paranoid


[09-Jun-19 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> but still its the only safe wallet now


[09-Jun-19 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Believe me, @0x03 is not someone to take security lightly


[09-Jun-19 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> good to know


[09-Jun-19 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But, better safe than sorry


[09-Jun-19 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763

[09-Jun-19 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <LocoMB> I have question here: Is VERUS mineable?
I have a small stack of them but right now can't find them traded anywhere else that digitalprice, (and not on CMC) how can I boost my stack a bit??


[09-Jun-19 03:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Verus is minable & stakable... our community developed wallet can mine and stake simultaneously. Alternatively you can mine and/or stake at pools.
Check our website for the possibilities: https://Veruscoin.io

[09-Jun-19 06:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> hello anybody here mines on x5650 ?


[09-Jun-19 06:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I don't think so. No AES and no AVX, which makes it a slow processor on Verushash


[09-Jun-19 06:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> it has AES


[09-Jun-19 06:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> i have 7x 5650 and 5660's


[09-Jun-19 06:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> 1x 3770k

[09-Jun-19 06:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> and alot of other core 2 quad era xeons around 30 of them


[09-Jun-19 06:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> most of them installed in my GPU mining farm


[09-Jun-19 06:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> so was wondering if i can put them to good use


[09-Jun-19 06:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You can try the miners from our webpage.


[09-Jun-19 06:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> The one posted above


[09-Jun-19 06:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> i looked on the bitcoin talk


[09-Jun-19 06:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> main thread, found no miners


[09-Jun-19 06:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> posted above where ?

[09-Jun-19 06:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> is this the only available miner ?


[09-Jun-19 06:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> What do you mean? There are several miners (plural) listed.


[09-Jun-19 06:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> oh right


[09-Jun-19 06:18 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Ok.üëå


[09-Jun-19 06:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> do you have and idea if mining this coin


[09-Jun-19 06:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> stresses a cpu till it pull it's full TDP rating


[09-Jun-19 06:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> or not ?


[09-Jun-19 06:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yes, it will go to full TDP


[09-Jun-19 06:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> so it's pretty heavy


[09-Jun-19 06:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> ok thanks for the answer

[09-Jun-19 06:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> I‚Äôve tested same gen.


[09-Jun-19 06:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Due to as mentioned doesn‚Äôt support the required instructions.


[09-Jun-19 06:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> hmmm


[09-Jun-19 06:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> but on the intel page it says that it has AES-NI


[09-Jun-19 06:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> support


[09-Jun-19 06:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Ark intel states otherwise.


[09-Jun-19 06:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> no avx though


[09-Jun-19 06:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> ok wait


[09-Jun-19 06:25 AM] Gateway#3763

[09-Jun-19 06:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> this is the first generation to support AES


[09-Jun-19 06:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Well, I'ld say, test and findout


[09-Jun-19 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> ok i will do it when time allows


[09-Jun-19 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> thanks for the input


[09-Jun-19 06:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> @skyboyextreme aes sure but avx no. And that is the main boy


[09-Jun-19 06:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> I thought the same thing.


[09-Jun-19 06:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Was worse than my celaron xD


[09-Jun-19 06:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> so it's not either


[09-Jun-19 06:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> And that‚Äôs a dual cpu rig.


[09-Jun-19 06:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> must be having both ?


[09-Jun-19 06:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Yeah best with both.


[09-Jun-19 06:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> oh well


[09-Jun-19 06:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Basic rule is basically anything 2010 and older is out


[09-Jun-19 06:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> maybe i will put them on the golem network or something then


[09-Jun-19 06:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Make that 2012 and older


[09-Jun-19 06:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Might be some exceptions. But yeah that‚Äôs close to when avx hit


[09-Jun-19 06:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> Yeah 2012 would be safe.


[09-Jun-19 06:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> aavx hit with the 3770k


[09-Jun-19 06:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> in 2012


[09-Jun-19 06:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> between 2008 and 2012 it's worth checking, below that: don't even think about it


[09-Jun-19 06:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> I think I run 2011s that have it.


[09-Jun-19 06:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> even sandy bridge in 2011 didn;'t have avx


[09-Jun-19 06:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> yea have a ton of 2008 xeons


[09-Jun-19 06:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> i didn't want to use celerons on my gpu farm


[09-Jun-19 06:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> as these cpus are pretty pathetic


[09-Jun-19 06:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> and cost more than quad core xeons


[09-Jun-19 06:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> that destroyed them in monero mining


[09-Jun-19 06:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> lol


[09-Jun-19 06:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <skyboyextreme> was a cpu + board for 5 gpus + 8gb of ddr2 for 50 bucks

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I just randomly bought some Pasta today and paid with Verus on VerusMobile and one click-to-confirm with a QR invoice. The store owner had a number of Komodo family coins and had just updated to the Verus PC and Mobile wallet. He lost some KMD in the hack and had already gotten it back, so had nice things to say about the ecosystem and liked the wallet. He suggested that when making an invoice on Verus Mobile, if his employees could enter the amount in dollars and have the invoice convert, it would be perfect for point of sale, and also said he'd put Verus Mobile right by square on their tablets for crypto-payment. Tweet has more details.

[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> @miketout What is the word on Zyrex & CMC?


[09-Jun-19 06:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> KYC and limits?

[09-Jun-19 07:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I only know they are new, have been working hard on their release, which seems to be a new system that is fast and seems to work well, and they chose a number of coins themselves for first listing, which included Verus Coin and the others. A number of devs from different projects were asked to test and wait until they announce to announce to the broader communities. They say the first 500 signups get 0% fees. I don't really know much else about them, and I would doubt that if DP doesn't have CMC listing yet that they would have it now.


[09-Jun-19 07:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> they did share this whitepaper: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/571199911731658761/587188179778666506/EN_Zyrex_Whitepaper_1.0.pdf

[09-Jun-19 09:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> It feels a lot like DP, in the sense that it is listing more privacy projects, and has a native coin that runs masternodes. I like it & I think it the exchange looks really good.


[09-Jun-19 09:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> I am thinking about writing an article on CoinMarketCap. The main reason it bothers me, is that they are treated as the main resource for cryptocurrency/exchange financial information--past & current. And they decide who gets listed & who doesn't, and they don't seem to hold true to their preferred listing requirements.

For example, they have Tron Classic listed, #1212.
It has $177 daily vol. and 465B tokens. 

CMC likes to see $10k daily volume, from potential listings. But most of the upper half, #1000-#2000, don't meet that one requirements. However, a project like Verus has yet to be listed. It's bs.

[10-Jun-19 12:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> confusingly (cause ZEX renamed to ZEXO) there's another token in the list called ZEXO, with a different logo. i am activating the right token right?

[10-Jun-19 12:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (Not Giving away Eth)> @Patrick Crypto  I like using Normalized Price, to check real value... Maybe you know it already. 
Make the total supply 21M. 
Take whatever number you needed, to bring it to 21M, and apply that to the current price.

The closer the two are, the better..


[10-Jun-19 12:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I mean... crypto coins are not shares in companies. They don't produce anything. Calling number of "coins * exchange price" market capitalization like they are stocks is silly. Same as people using "ROI" as a time.


[10-Jun-19 12:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @gigamesh if ZEX renamed to ZEXO, I think it would be prudent to activate ZEXO in Agama...

[10-Jun-19 12:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <LocoMB> @miketout I am trying to understand the relation between VERUS and Komodo- I understand that VERUS is a friendly fork of Komodo, and obviously the blockchains are mostly compatibel - but is  VERUS a  sort of main chain as Komodo chain is, and that VERUS replicates a complete Komodo-like chain hierarchy with assetchains parallel to Komodo? VERUS uses a different hashing algo? (I bought 11k VERUS for 1 BTC in the early days, so I really love see it increase again these days üòÖ but not sure if I can afford to bolster my stack)


[10-Jun-19 12:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <LocoMB> I am trying to understand the degree of cross chain compatibility


[10-Jun-19 01:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <LocoMB> Verus-Agama 0.6 saved a lot of peoples assets.. I was the one bitching around here about the naming overlap a cpl months ago, but the functioinal overlap is very beneficial obviously.
Oth, it wouldn't be too surprising if Komodo would discontinue Agama entirely, come to think of it


[10-Jun-19 01:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @LocoMB, yes Verus is friendly fork of Komodo but is very much it's own project in every sense. The lead devs for the projects maintain a healthy relationship and make regular contributions to each other. It seems a few out there share a similar interest in open-source and technologically advancing crypto for the benefit of the entire field, recognizing that rising tides lifts all ships, versus the more closed off I, me, mine, self-serving model that *some* of us may already be familiar with.


[10-Jun-19 01:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Though, that doesn't help you to understand the degree of cross chain compatibility on a more technical level, just wanted to clear up that they were in fact both very unique, stand alone projects that share a similar code base and in which the developers maintain a healthy relationship centered on general blockchain growth for a better over all future.


[10-Jun-19 01:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <LocoMB> oh I think I'll just dig around some more in the tech resources...


[10-Jun-19 01:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> iirc Verus is completely compatible with the crosschain capabilities that Komodo has. Verus has extended those capabilities quit a lot in preparation of PBaaS release.


[10-Jun-19 01:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <LocoMB> Baas is a buzzword that many projects have been riding for quite some time, but somehow most of them don't seem to be going anywhere really, except grabbing huge pots of ICO money (thinking of ARDOR, HEAT, STRATIS etcetc) ...  Komodo/Verus seem to be overhauling these shiny spit-n-polish business types by leaps and bounds


[10-Jun-19 01:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I think the easiest way to seperate the 'grab and exit' projects from the serious projects is having a look at ICO, premine, marketing and presence  at exchanges.
It's a bold statement, I know that. Some of the projects that I just weeded out with that statement will have solid tech, will have good intentions and are here to stay and make a difference.
The dedication that this community and particularly our developers  have to realizing the Verus vision is hard to compare to other communities outside the Komodo ecosystem. I think that sets us apart from other projects promoting BaaS.
In addition to that: most BaaS chains are depending on a centralized environment, controlled by an entity with the intention to make profit... Verus is quite the opposite.

Everyone does it & it makes it very fair.

If I wanted to find the price of a 1989 Troy Aikman rookie card, I'd go buy a Becket Price Guide, or look online, at their site.

If I want to find out the price of a cryptocurrency, i might have to look at 3 places. And then I wonder, but why wouldn't it be on the other one? Is there an issue?

[10-Jun-19 05:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Well I always felt max supply was a somewhat relevant way to judge scarcity. A $0.10 coin with 21mil max supply has an apparent greater potential  for growth than a $0.10 coin with a 21bil max supply. Of course there are many other factors too and most terms are relative to something else so no one true easy gauge but put all those little bits of info together and hopefully we can make a somewhat educated guess.


[10-Jun-19 07:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gamer278> I saw a post of someone paying for something with verus. If Verus is going to be used to pay for things wouldn't the price have to go way up in the future with a max supply of 84 mil?  There wouldn't be enough to go around if it didn't correct?


[10-Jun-19 07:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Well, you've got decimals.

[10-Jun-19 07:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mining Spec> 84 mil is the same as Litecoin and its at $126 now

[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> What kind of Verus price are you guys thinking can we expect once DigitalPrice and Verus get added on CMC? Do coins usually go up in value before they are added to CMC? With Verus¬¥s current market cap we¬¥ll be ranked #379, could we expect to bump up in rank too?


[10-Jun-19 08:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> I firmly believe it will lead to more exposure overall.


[10-Jun-19 08:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> The "Recently Added" on CMC is highly monitored.


[10-Jun-19 08:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> For me, price going up or down, isn't the issue.


[10-Jun-19 08:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> I think being listed among all of the other projects, on CMC, will be a positive thing all around.


[10-Jun-19 08:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Verus has held up its price, very well.
It doesn't react to BTC price swings, as do other alts.
And that is unique.


[10-Jun-19 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Most of the time, they are still in price discovery when they get added to CMC.  @Crupti I think you are describing more of being added onto say, Binance.
Bc all of the above that you mentioned, will happen.
But CMC is for total overall exposure. You might get new community members, that eventually bring new volume. But the idea, is to focus on full market exposure and a good community

[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @10 @yaheardme @Patrick Crypto Then it will be a great if Pirate (ARRR) is anything to go by. Pirate was $0.05 May 15th, $0.09 on May 23rd (CMC listing day), peaked at $0.23 June 3rd, and is today at $0.13.

[10-Jun-19 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Thank you! @10 just dropping in for a minute before getting back to that.
On blockchain compatibility, the core blockchains are generally compatible in many ways that matter, but after the last upstream of Sapling tech, Komodo decided to change blocksize and max tx size in a way that I was not comfortable pushing that quickly into Verus at the time (not criticizing their decision, just was the case at the time). That led to our decision to include 2 daemons in Verus Agama, which allowed us to support all coins natively while focusing on interoperability vs equivalene. Since that time, we released further enhancements to custom consensus processing, VerusHash 2.0, the nothing at stake solution, and the newest Verus Proof of Power that was the mathematcially provable 51% hash attack resistant update, which with Komodo-notarized projects is a bit less important.


[10-Jun-19 12:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> For PBaaS, we changed the header meaningfully for merge mining, merkle mountain range proofs, and header-based proof against targeted fake-stake header attacks, another industry solution that we just haven't talked about yet. We also changed the coinbase and extra-nonce to make it so that coinbases can include an instant-spend form of output that enables PBaaS notarization competition and will also enable reserve currency conversion on chain in a way that solves front-running. This is a lot of detail on things that will also be in PBaaS and have not been written up yet, but that is a basic set of differences, which are fairly substantial. At the same time, there is compatibility in notarized, cross-chain transactions and much of the enhancements to things like CCs and even notarization benefits can be pulled upstream at some point. PBaaS itself requires some significant changes, so it may be more a Verus thing for some time, hence the primary goal is full interoperability over equivalence.

[dscrdvrsc] <10> Header-based proof to defend against fake stake header attacks

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @LocoMB üëÜ


[10-Jun-19 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> yes. in the fake stake attacks that made the rounds a while back, everyone, including Verus, stopped them at the block level and mitigated any header-based issues. This new proof in PoS headers after the PBaaS upgrade will allow headers to efficiently prove their PoS validity and be quickly invalidated as appropriate before ever being considered as a potentially valid entry.


[10-Jun-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it's also nice in that it improves the ability to disprove incorrect auto-notarizations on PBaaS chains

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> So cool üòé. Here, I feel like every day there is something new to be blown away by, when it's a rarity to get that more than even once elsewhere. I think I've said this but I always think of an onion with layers on layers of tech and best is how each part comes together to form an entire self-reinforcing ecosystem where the sum is greater than its parts. I have been impressed but I continue to be blown away. üéá

[11-Jun-19 02:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rob> Just tried to withdraw some Verus from DP, however TXID isn't in verus explorer, not sure if they ended up on a fork, may be worth not withdrawing until resolved. Waiting to hear back from DP.


[11-Jun-19 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> @rob I just checked and my withdrawal arrived within minutes. I think it's ok.


[11-Jun-19 03:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rob> @Thoskk  ah that's good, thanks for checking! Mine did appear in my wallet briefly, but with 0 confirms, then disappeared shortly after. Will wait to hear from DP on it.

[dscrdvrsc] <johnyk> Hi guys? Do we have any information about verus getting added in coinmarketcap? I know that they wanted some info from digitalprice exchange have they asked something too from verus?


[11-Jun-19 03:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I've heard the rumours, but haven't heard that somebody was contacted for information.


[11-Jun-19 03:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <johnyk> they seem too slow for integration. But you have applied months ago right?


[11-Jun-19 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> We don't meet their requirements if DP isn't listed, I'm not sure... It was discussed a lot here


[11-Jun-19 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You can bet on it that as soon as DP is listed, we will apply if that hasn't happened yet


[11-Jun-19 03:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <johnyk> Dp will be listed sooner or later. I would be happy to see vrsc too. Its a good project and so many projects out there get listed and are pure scams


[11-Jun-19 03:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> Just a little patience ... Verus just had first anniversary, give CMC some time to mature üòâ


[11-Jun-19 03:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Indeed... but we're growing slow and steady right now.. No hypes, steadily building the foundation for a healthy future!


[11-Jun-19 03:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> yes, that looks very nicely at the moment ... although it inferferes with my investment plans üòÇ


[11-Jun-19 03:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <johnyk> @Oink exactly verus is not a hype p$d coin. In the long run it will be just beautiful to watch

[11-Jun-19 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Better mine something more profitable with GPU and exchange for Verus (or get payed in Verus)


[11-Jun-19 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763

[11-Jun-19 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @gamer278, legacy uses the older Z*c* addresses, where Sapling is the newer faster Z*s* addresses. Both work but might as well use the newer one. Much faster and lighter on resources. Haha Thanks @Oink, it doesn't extend much further! üòÜ

[12-Jun-19 06:18 AM] Gateway#3763

[12-Jun-19 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> To have hundreds or thousands of a coin like Verus, with it's low supply and future potential, is very promising


[12-Jun-19 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Or even just 25 or 50

[12-Jun-19 09:42 AM] Gateway#3763

[12-Jun-19 09:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> PIRATE is all privacy transactions.


[12-Jun-19 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hin5584> Similar to zcash?


[12-Jun-19 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> VRSC is Blockchains as a Service and more securer superior consensus also.


[12-Jun-19 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> you can see PIRATE is exactly what Zcash is, just without any transparent transactions in it.


[12-Jun-19 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> So, it's much more **better** on user's transaction's privacy.

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Love the kmd community kindness. Really cool of both Pirate and Verus. These guys lead by a good example and set the new standard by proving that we all benefit when we support each other, rather than the tired old model of secrecy and selfishness. Open source and let the people decide what's best. If you fear this, chances are you weren't creating or adding much anyhow.. but really love the back and forth of helping out that I keep seeing, both from developers but also across communities.  Truly something special. üëå üòé

Hi. I'm having a problem with the Verus Agama (6.0-13 pbaas) for windows (10). It refuses to shutdown when native mode is used. It stays on the "please wait" window indefinitely, until I force close the agama process chain. I am not sure if this can damage something. Last time I force closed it, it seems to have corrupted part of the local KMD chain, as it had to resync part it already synched before.


[13-Jun-19 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> Yes @Crupti and @Oink - Graviex is a CMC listed exchange. üòú

[dscrdvrsc] <FishyGuts> Also they have a faucet which is a good idea to use.  We‚Äôve had a few new users because of it and it sparks trading activity.

[13-Jun-19 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bubu> good morning folks‚òï


[14-Jun-19 12:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> There has been two CMC listed exchanged for a few months now. Since January?


[14-Jun-19 01:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Mid February


[14-Jun-19 01:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @Patrick Crypto, I think just one for a bit. I guess DP has a coin on CMC but DP as an exchange isn't actually on CMC unfortunately. 
But... Now it should only be a matter of time.. and I really couldn't imagine things working out better.


[14-Jun-19 01:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> VRSC has been listed on Stex for almost a year, and Crypto-Bridge since mid Feb


[14-Jun-19 01:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Things seem to be coming together at a healthy, natural rate and we should get there at least, in no small part, thanks to the goodwill brought on through our continued mutual support for and from our KMD brethren. What better way to forge ahead in this sometimes seemingly jaded world of crypto that's quickly becoming calloused over from the past decade's model of selfishness and secrecy. Reading the tweets from the last few days has been a refreshing change of pace. Way to lead by example!   Would also like to thank the Pirate team and community too!


[14-Jun-19 01:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> They paid for the CB listing because CMC.


[14-Jun-19 01:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Is stex and cryptobridge on CMC as exchanges?


[14-Jun-19 01:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> yes


[14-Jun-19 01:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> but CB sucks, and I think only me and some bots trade on Stex


[14-Jun-19 01:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Hmm not sure but perhaps there are other stipulations like volume or something


[14-Jun-19 01:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> yes


[14-Jun-19 01:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Well I set up accounts on the two new exchanges and sent a few bucks over to try to help things along. We have the means now so hopefully just a short matter of time


[14-Jun-19 01:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I like DP, and they seem like nice people, but they need to get their shit together


[14-Jun-19 01:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Just when they were starting to get some traction and momentum they are stumbling


[14-Jun-19 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yeah, I try not to get too attached to any one exchange, simply because there's too many unknowns and the history hasn't been the greatest for many seemingly established exchanges. That being said, I have grown quite fond of Digital Price and I hope they continue to grow along with some of the better projects they had the foresight to support. For that reason, along with their pretty good support, I wish them the best.


[14-Jun-19 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <dŒõtmox> ok üëå


[14-Jun-19 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> This SSL issue, right after the KMD theft, degrades my confidence in them. Hopefully they learn from it. It's a misstep which can cause a huge loss of business though.


[14-Jun-19 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> if you have a selection of different coins, it's difficult to get attached with one exchange anyway ^^ I think I'm registred at least on a dozen exchanges, to get all the coins sold and bought I mined and hodl until now.

[14-Jun-19 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> yeah what


[14-Jun-19 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> probably bc it has no volume at all


[14-Jun-19 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Context?


[14-Jun-19 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Okay

[dscrdvrsc] <10> On an exchange, you choose BTC pairings etc

[dscrdvrsc] <10> Verus pairing is unverified

[14-Jun-19 02:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Well it should be on CMC then


[14-Jun-19 02:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Bc CryptoBridje is on CMC


[14-Jun-19 02:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> might be related to API, or maybe volume


[14-Jun-19 02:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Did I hear my name? Haha hey y'all. Mornin here! Gotta rush off to work but did I see something about fiat to z-address?! That would be crazy..

[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> miketoutLast Saturday at 2:10 AM
we have Stex and CB. not many people use them
we applied to CMC, and they said to point them to a CMC listed exchange that gets volume. DP volume would be fine, but it's not on CMC listed exchanges


[14-Jun-19 02:50 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <10> I think it is, for such a small exchange


[14-Jun-19 02:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> CMC is only relevant bc it will give the project more exposure ...


[14-Jun-19 02:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> volume is one thing, but I really like the interface of Stex a lot more than DP or Graviex


[14-Jun-19 02:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> and that one additional digit on Graviex is ridiculous, tbh


[14-Jun-19 02:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I don't mind STEX but they need a better way to find/display markets


[14-Jun-19 02:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> but hey, trade where you like to, decentralisation is always a thing.


[14-Jun-19 02:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Actually, I just noticed a list and search box on the bottom right. I don't know how I missed it before


[14-Jun-19 03:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Thoskk> because that's nowhere to look for it üòÑ


[14-Jun-19 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> haha


[14-Jun-19 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> All exchanges do the same thing


[14-Jun-19 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Any time I end up back at the default market page, which I think is btc/eth I always just go to my URL bar history to go back to the vrsc market


[14-Jun-19 03:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Only ways one exchange is better than another is liquidity & security


[14-Jun-19 03:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> They really are the ones that make money here


[14-Jun-19 03:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Stex does have a decent mobile app, which is surprising.


[14-Jun-19 03:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Only the big exchanges really offer that


[14-Jun-19 05:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> DP is working again


[14-Jun-19 05:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Patrick Crypto I suspect that there will be a lot more volume on those CMC exchanges you mentioned once Verus is listed on CMC, just because these CMC exchanges have a lot more users which won¬¥t bother to register on yet another exchange if Verus is available on an exchange that they already use.


[14-Jun-19 12:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Agreed


[14-Jun-19 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Just like with Binance...US traders will be limited


[14-Jun-19 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> We won't have many options to choose from lol


[14-Jun-19 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <austone> It's fine, we'll have facebook's coin! ü§¢

[14-Jun-19 10:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <nille> good morning everyone ‚òï


[14-Jun-19 10:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Ahh must be nice to be European


[14-Jun-19 10:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Morning all. and 10: indeed is is....


[14-Jun-19 10:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @MrCryptoCash-AcedPoker.io That was what I was waiting for... Ordered right away...


[15-Jun-19 12:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> I think yesterday's Binance news, really showed that US users could benefit greatly from Atomic Swaps, or an OTC platform. But even if that involved KMD or VRSC, I'd see regulations being complied with. Hmmmm.. Tough stuff


[15-Jun-19 01:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> @MrCryptoCash-AcedPoker.io my tshirt order already shipped? if not i'd like to add a basecap to it if possible.


[15-Jun-19 01:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> fully decentralized cross chain atomic swaps appear to be the only type of "exchange" that fits into the exemptions defined by the recent SEC fincen guidelines. there is actually a specific paragraph stating it is exempt


[15-Jun-19 01:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Looks like Komodo and Verus are ahead of all exchanges in that respect...


[15-Jun-19 01:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> yes, a lot of fake DEX, claiming to be decentralized, but most of those are using a proxy token and then trading onchain the token. so being a DEX for a token, but the real coins are controlled by a single entity. i only know of a few multisig gateways, which might be enough to overcome the custodial burden. but the entire proxy token DEX, it just seems like not enough to fit into the exemption


[15-Jun-19 01:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> turns out the decentralization in this case is not just for idealistic reasons


[15-Jun-19 01:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> fully decentralized cross chain atomic DEX seems the only way to avoid the regulations, likely as the regulators realized it couldnt be regulated anyway


[15-Jun-19 01:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I was just about to say that


[15-Jun-19 01:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> however, they did even give an exemption to informational sites that displayed status of the atomic DEX, which is something they didnt have to do


[15-Jun-19 01:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> they did also say that a dapp that is doing money transmission is subject to regulation, though not sure how they will regulate code on the blockchain


[15-Jun-19 01:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> a Dapp is (IMO) a point of entry to the blockchain... Nothing centralized about that.... On the other hand, I can imaging them reasoning a dapp being centrally created / updated / maintained. That would throw us back in the discussion similar to whether the swiping wallets on KMD chain was a centralized action...


[15-Jun-19 01:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> they seem to model things based on ETH smart contracts that need to be refilled with ETH for gas


[15-Jun-19 01:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> maybe if you pay for the gas, you are guilty?


[15-Jun-19 01:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> They would basically say that any actions taken by a small independent group of people is centralization


[15-Jun-19 01:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> the rescuing of the exposed wallets was definitely a centralized action. i decided it was better to sweep the funds rather than allow the hacker to


[15-Jun-19 01:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> I agreed and I think a lot of the crypto community agreed with that action as well


[15-Jun-19 01:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> it seems to have been covered by good samaritan laws, similar to finding a wallet in the street


[15-Jun-19 01:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> The alternative was not good, at all


[15-Jun-19 01:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> I don't want to speculate how bad it would have been


[15-Jun-19 01:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> there isnt time to get permission from the wallet owner, like seeing whose wallet it is, trying to contact them to get permission to take their wallet off the street


[15-Jun-19 01:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I agree on that, but I see it as decentralized, because anyone with the skills and deciveness could have initiated it. drastic circumstances require drastic actions, IMO


[15-Jun-19 01:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> and while you are waiting for permission, a kid on a skateboard zooms by and grabs the cash in it, making it very silly to have waited


[15-Jun-19 01:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> and in our case, we have no way of contacting users from an address


[15-Jun-19 01:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> It makes crypto kind of irrelevant in the real world, when monies like that are allowed to be lost and never recovered.


[15-Jun-19 01:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> We are all adults and need our funds.


[15-Jun-19 01:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> I thought it was right, for sure


[15-Jun-19 01:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> the hardliners who say the code is law, ignore the reality of unintended bugs


[15-Jun-19 01:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> it is definitely new territory and hopefully our actions sets a good precedent for future hack resolutions


[15-Jun-19 01:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> To talk in a Pirate fashion: They're more like guidelines...


[15-Jun-19 01:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Ethereum is impractical ...
I say that with respect, for what they do, though.


[15-Jun-19 01:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> we did sweep a small amount of VRSC, if you find your coins went to the sweep address, DM me and i will take care of it


[15-Jun-19 01:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Their DEX are not really usable.
And decentralization, like they see it, is not functional in the real world


[15-Jun-19 01:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> That's why I always like Komodo


[15-Jun-19 01:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Creativity


[15-Jun-19 01:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> But very practical


[15-Jun-19 01:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Komodo is the reason I'm here in the Verus Community today....


[15-Jun-19 01:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @here Read this message, **check your wallets to see if you are missing VRSC**!!!

[15-Jun-19 01:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> also i have to thank the entire verus community for helping out during this crisis.


[15-Jun-19 01:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Just being good neighbours


[15-Jun-19 01:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> it will end up really raising the visibility of verus too


[15-Jun-19 01:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Especially with the exposure and gift from Pirate!


[15-Jun-19 01:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> i am really happy that within the komodo ecosystem, the projects are indeed good neighbors!


[15-Jun-19 01:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> We all know your good spirit and desire to want to improve  the crypto community, as a whole .... you've put in many years in crypto


[15-Jun-19 01:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> if only the entire crypto can behave this way, we would be much farther ahead


[15-Jun-19 01:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> it does feel like one of my years, is 7 normal ones


[15-Jun-19 01:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Nxt, Bitcoin Dark, Supernet, KMD...
We do appreciate your willingness to talk with the community and be accessible


[15-Jun-19 01:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I get it. The progress Komodo is making is only matched by a select few (Of which I think Verus is one)


[15-Jun-19 01:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> there is just so much more to deal with than most people realize, tip of the iceberg effect


[15-Jun-19 01:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> In what aspect?


[15-Jun-19 01:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> just that everything is a lot harder than it looks. from the simple getting an exchange listing, to having a website to making releases


[15-Jun-19 01:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> there are attackers throughout the process


[15-Jun-19 01:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> As I have as description in my twitter: *Most people get into Crypto Currency. Some people find out about the Blockchains behind them. Few people realize the potential.*


[15-Jun-19 01:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> There are always attackers...
My friend showed me some screenshots, from his network at a major corp...lol


[15-Jun-19 01:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Ir√°n, Russia all of these people trying to get in


[15-Jun-19 01:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> all day


[15-Jun-19 01:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> yes, whereever there is money, there are attackers


[15-Jun-19 01:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> one hacker targets websites of projects doing ICO/IEO. takes it down with ddos or whatever to blackmail them for BTC


[15-Jun-19 02:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> They know they can get away with it... Small ~~change~~ chance to be brought to justice, big rewards...


[15-Jun-19 02:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Lol..I can't stand exchanges, guys ..
I've really never liked them, tbh.
They get a lot of money, for doing one thing.


[15-Jun-19 02:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> They get too much importance placed on their role


[15-Jun-19 02:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> @jl777c KMD ever going to run an ICO again?


[15-Jun-19 02:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> They'll fade into history once real decentralized trading picks up, especially after the SEC exemption...


[15-Jun-19 02:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> I knew I liked you  @Oink


[15-Jun-19 02:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> For now, we need them, but future will tell if that'll change


[15-Jun-19 02:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Man I can't say enough how nice it is, to have guys like Mike & JL, present in their communities...


[15-Jun-19 02:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> thre's no point discussing if hacking the hacker made sense; not your keys - not your coins; keys leaked = coins public


[15-Jun-19 02:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Ethereum community would probably feel different


[15-Jun-19 02:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> so anyone could take them; team decided to take them and bring back to original users


[15-Jun-19 02:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> how can anyone not see this as sth good ?


[15-Jun-19 02:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> Some might not bc it was a centralized action...
But they are impractical and don't care about their users, if they felt that way .. Not a coin I would want to hold


[15-Jun-19 02:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> I mnot sure if there is such a thing like "Eth community" , in this communities when one can gain a lot of money you got paid troll groups most probably, so who care what such communities produce as thoughts, I got my own üòÉ


[15-Jun-19 02:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> @10 centralization is good same as decentralization - depends on context, people who dont understand it... well poor people


[15-Jun-19 02:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> if someone believes nothing in crypto can be centralized because it's bad... well he is just wrong


[15-Jun-19 02:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> this was totally outside the blockchain


[15-Jun-19 02:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> the talk of centralization is totally stupid


[15-Jun-19 02:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> centralized action would be here when most notaries decides to roll back


[15-Jun-19 02:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> and that was not the case


[15-Jun-19 02:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> same as CZ said they considered roll back of BTC


[15-Jun-19 02:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> that is like saying if you can centrally send funds from your address to someone else, that makes the blockchain centralized??


[15-Jun-19 02:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> centralization means that a single party VALIDATES and others have to trust


[15-Jun-19 02:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> No, I was just saying centralized, as in you mentioned it earlier...

the rescuing of the exposed wallets was definitely a centralized action. i decided it was better to sweep the funds rather than allow the hacker to


[15-Jun-19 02:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> in this case 100% of all our sweep transactions are fully validated by all nodes and the blockchain


[15-Jun-19 02:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> almost all usage of the blockchain is centralized!


[15-Jun-19 02:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> it is the validation that is decentralized


[15-Jun-19 02:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> unless you need consensus from all nodes to do a spend, it is a centralized action, isnt it?


[15-Jun-19 02:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> so people that complain that the funds rescue was bad because it was centralized, fundamentally dont even understand what decentralization is


[15-Jun-19 02:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> He simply asked what people could see to criticize, in that action?
I simply restated what you wrote, as a possible criticism.


[15-Jun-19 02:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> the fact that many are so called "devs" for other projects, it is just very sad


[15-Jun-19 02:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> every action in the world is lead by a leader, so it is centralized, and pointing this out as sth bad is stupid, prove if otherwise


[15-Jun-19 02:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> in this term any crypto is centralized


[15-Jun-19 02:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> i have seen other coin devs say it is bad as it was a centralized action. maybe they didnt understand at all what happened, but in that case why are they making public comments?

[15-Jun-19 02:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> they just felt it is good time to kick komodo when it is struggling with a major hack event

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Please let us know if your block height does not match the explorer. It seems that vrsc.52hash.com pool is currently on a fork. We do not have other reports of a fork from the community.


[18-Jun-19 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> Checked all my nodes and I'm g2g. Curious of what happened, especially with the nortarizations


[18-Jun-19 06:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it looks like they dropped then added a lot of hash power and had some very poor connectivity at that moment, maybe even a network split. They began mining very fast on their own fork with more than 51% of the rest of the hash it looks like while the network was split. We attempted to connect to them with a couple nodes, but we never did confirm a connection until it was all over and their fork re-merged. It seems that broader network connectivity came back before it was considered irrecoverable and proof of power used the stake on the main chain, even though he had greater hash power to reorganize him to the right chain. It wouldn't have needed the notaries, but if somehow PoP would have failed, that would have been a secondary backup as well. If it had been irrecoverable, they would have had to reset their chain, but it would not have affected the rest of the chain.


[18-Jun-19 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> So, basically it seems all worked as expected except the pool's network connectivity, and we will talk to him to see how to improve that. Also, it would be good for big miners to spread their hash around.

[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> not refused

[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> well if just one operator does it, it ends up having the same effect


[18-Jun-19 09:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> also, given the special circumstances of the problem we faced it may be wise to have a node or two __within__ GFW territory

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Crupti Just for your information, deposits are to a Transparent Address, not a Private Address...

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Website is updated with the new exchange (https://Zaddex.io) with the trading pairs **VRSC/BTC**, **VRSC/KMD** and **VRSC/ZEXO**.
Special thanks to our mega-fast response time of our hidden Web Infrastructure Guru @0x03

[19-Jun-19 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> It's all for Verus... LOL


[19-Jun-19 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I mean maybe just put on the site the ones that don't have Verus yet, might be easier at this point üòâ


[19-Jun-19 02:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Nah, that's not my style. There are probably tons of small exchanges around I'm not aware of.


[19-Jun-19 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I was thinking in to Put them nicely in 3 columns, like the mining software below. With a bit more information about the exchanges and with their own logo. Then put sites like coingecko, coinpaprika and hopefully coinmarketcap where the exchanges are now.


[19-Jun-19 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That sounds really cool and more interactive feeling. Funny all those little details add up very nicely. I like even the little icons for discord, reddit, twitter, etc. Nice touch! üëå

[19-Jun-19 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Those icons are used to comply with their terms of use... Since YouTube requires (officially) prior written consent, I went with generic icons on the media page

[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> Yeah, it was 10, but they changed it to 80 for some reason. Don't know why. If they don't change it to something more reasonable I won't be using it

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> The z-address there is a sapling. Since sprouts are no longer supported it‚Äôs useless to be able to create one.

I made a refund claim submission for KMD that got swept into the safe holding account nearly 48 hours ago, but have not received the KMD in the new wallet yet.  What are my next steps to get the situation corrected?


[21-Jun-19 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I actually got a DM like that earlier  @Oink


[21-Jun-19 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I keep reporting those DMs to discord... nearly a days job by now...


[21-Jun-19 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Oink @Godballz Set your Discord status to Invisible, that will prevent the spam.


[21-Jun-19 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> It does, but for support purposed I feel that peeps should see I‚Äôm online

[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> You also miss all the tips

[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> But, I prefer to be spam-less


[21-Jun-19 12:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> That‚Äôs irrelevant to me... I rain them away anyway


[21-Jun-19 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Talking about bots, would you like a Discord bot that tells the VRSC price?


[21-Jun-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Username would be price


[21-Jun-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> In a dedicated bot channel, some may find it useful


[21-Jun-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> , ex. "VRSC $0.22"


[21-Jun-19 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I try not to be a compulsive checker... I‚Äôm working on my pension, so fluctuations are irrelevant to me


[21-Jun-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> Some groups create a group for bots that is always visible to the right, like "MOD" here but named "BOTS" where it would show the latest price contstantly, handy for those that like the price in Discord.


[21-Jun-19 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> And besides that... I am of the opinion that BTC doesn‚Äôt go up or down, but fiat goes down/up


[21-Jun-19 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Same as transition to Euro...people didn‚Äôt get used to it, because they kept converting to old currency

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Yellowstone if you don't solve this. please DM me. I had never seen this before until someone told me about it happening to them a few days ago.

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I have heard from them. I believe they will ship. They explained what happened, which I will let them explain themselves and said they would provide an update within the week. I suggested that at this point, if they are near having something to show proof of where they are, they should consider waiting until they can include that in the update. They have a new dev working only on that, and I will make myself available to him if it will help.

[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> You can create your own blockchains as a service, see #pbaas-development for testchain work, PBaaS mainnet is planned in July @wangzhe


[23-Jun-19 03:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> In addition to PBaaS these features are also currently on their testnet:
-Merge mining
-On-chain coin swap w/o the need for coin exchange listing (Banchor algorithm)


[23-Jun-19 03:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <wangzhe> Ok


[23-Jun-19 03:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @wangzhe Based on Komodo and ZCash, VerusCoin already have these features on their mainnet since last year:
-Proof-of-power
-Proof-of-Stake (50%) with about 28% annual interest last time I checked a couple of months ago
-Proof-of-Work (50%) CPU-minable coins due to anti-fpga/asic algorithm as featured by VoskCoin https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a88b3bZwDi8&feature=youtu.be
-zero-knowledge privacy coin (zk-snark) z-addresses

[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @IP Personally, I¬¥m waiting for CMC and mainnet PBaaS üòÉ


[26-Jun-19 12:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> DigitalPrice is supposed to be a CMC exchange soon is the rumour (where VerusCoin has it¬¥s greatest trade volume), and mainnet PBaaS is scheduled for July the last I heard.


[26-Jun-19 12:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I imagine with the Agama developments the Komodo Hack brought with it, Mike not being able to fully focus on PBaaS. Furthermore Mike never mentioned a scheduled release date, just a rough estimate. It'll be released when fully tested and approved worthy of release...


[26-Jun-19 12:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> What's disgusting is that garbage exchanges like BiteBTC which outright steal people's money are listed on CMC and other aggregators while DP which has been pretty decent for over a year are not


[26-Jun-19 12:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Patrick Crypto Read some recent experiences Pirate users have with DP. Check their discord for details...


[26-Jun-19 12:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> It doesn't seem like those issues are unique to DP though


[26-Jun-19 12:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> The problems aren't. They way it's dealt with is.


[26-Jun-19 12:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> BiteBTC deals with problems by closing accounts. It's outright theft, but they are still listed(let alone operating)

Yeah, thought I'd just level the expectations a bit, if that's how CMC's gonna play it.

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> indeed...

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Morning to you too...


[26-Jun-19 12:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> And gotta say, volume on DP has been pretty swell lately, maybe not the current price at this moment, but volume. Nice to see.


[26-Jun-19 12:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Price is a matter of supply & demand. For now: the higher the price, the more supply from profit miners... If demand hits their mining capacity ceiling, the price can go up further.


[26-Jun-19 12:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Profit miners keeps VRSC acting as a stable coin pegged to valuta, at the moment... üòÉ


[26-Jun-19 12:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Oink Mike T said PBaaS mainnet was scheduled for July a the video with Crypto Rich, but it was just a rough estimate, I think.

[dscrdvrsc] <mox> can you give a real short summary of pirate and dp oink?


[26-Jun-19 12:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I would need to revisit that video what he actually said. I remember being surprised he mentioned a timeframe, because he usually doesn‚Äôt commit to deadlines.


[26-Jun-19 01:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> DP has stuck Pirate transaction and is not able to 'unstuck' them. From Pirate devs suggestions were made how to go about that problem to solve this particular incident and how to prevent it from happening again... I believe this was somewhere around halfway May... Still not solved. But the details I don't have in my head, they are in Pirate discord.


[26-Jun-19 01:02 AM] Gateway#3763

[26-Jun-19 01:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Issues will happen... It's how they are solved that show the dedication of the people running it. And that's what counts IMO.


[26-Jun-19 01:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Making a withdrawal, that never get's put on the chain.... Will keep showing in DP as unconfirmed...


[26-Jun-19 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Crupti I just revisited the video and on minute 46 @Crypto Rich  asks: "*When Mainnet?*"
@miketout answers: "*I work my hardest to spend my time on actually building and creating and not trying to promise specific dates, because I care more that it's done right, than that it's done by a specific date.....*"
And in minute 48 Mike states: "*I do believe we are on the main net before the end of July, but I don't know that for sure and I really hesitate to give a specific date.*"


[26-Jun-19 04:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> A lot more was said about this, but the bottom line is basically: It'll be released when it's ready to be released. Not sooner, not later.


[26-Jun-19 08:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10 (GFY)> @zpajk Why repost my quote about CMC?


[26-Jun-19 08:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> @10 Because there was speculation about meeting the requirements by exchanges alone. My take on your post means CMC wants volume as well.


[26-Jun-19 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> $8k-$10k is what I was told


[26-Jun-19 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> not by cmc but from a good source


[26-Jun-19 08:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> I never thought I'd say this, but at this point, I wouldn't worry about CMC


[26-Jun-19 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> The coming months will bring changes in crypto, in general, and you never know how CMC will stand. I'm not a fan of how they list projects, and I'm not the only one. So we will see.


[26-Jun-19 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <10> I think a strategy of focusing on everything around CMC, and not it itself, would work best.

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> exactly, but I am working on much cooler capabilities than basic Bancor :)
right now, I have the code setup to enable a full solution to liquidity, high volume, friction free, decentralized exchanging of reserve currencies, also with a solution to front running. Miners and stakers will make blocks that can include conversions to and from a reserve currency. The reserve ratio is determined by a starting point, and then can be modified at every block by things like emission and burn transactions. The reserve ratio is then a function of the starting reserve and net emission. In any single block, all transactions, both buy and sell that can be processed, are, whether or not there are sellers when people want to buy or buyers when people want to sell. Market conversions will always get put into a block and processed as long as they can fit. Limit conversion orders will process if they can be added to the block and still meet the target limit price for conversion.
So, how do we solve front-running and eliminate the possibility of flash trading?
All conversions processed in a single block get exactly the same conversion price for both buys and sells (NO SPREAD!)
There will be a small fee that effectively beats all exchanges but will go only to miners and stakers of the PBaaS reserve chains, which is where the conversions take place, providing even more of a network effect for merge mining and profit opportunities for people who mine and stake chains well beyond block emissions.


[26-Jun-19 12:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> We also expect to make this easy from the wallet across reserve chains, providing full liquidity sharing across the Verus ecosystem, meaning that if any PBaaS fractional reserve currency independently gets on exchanges, it is an option, not a requirement, since full liquidity will be built into the cross-chain protocol.


[26-Jun-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> so is that like VRSC is used to create a reserve currency independent chain?
like putting for example 2 VRSC and defining the supply of 200 XCOIN, and that value to each unit of XCOIN a 0.01 VRSC as on its creation? and then when a part of these 200 XCOIN is converted back to VRSC, the value of the rest of the XCOIN is adjusted ?


[26-Jun-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> is my understanding correct?


[26-Jun-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> Another question is, can these reserve currencies be only PBaaS chains only or can other independent blockchains from KMD ecosystem or even outside of ecosystem be used in reserve currencies system etc?


[26-Jun-19 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> like with bancor they basically supported ETH only tokens, and now they also support EOS tokens extend it outside it's core ecosystem, what it will look like with PBaaS reserve currencies ?


[26-Jun-19 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You understand the conversion correct.
Any PBaaS chain will have the Liquid reserve capabilities in addition to all the protocols already implemented in the Komodo ecosystem. So using CC etc, they can interact with any other chain, but not in the sense they interact with Verus, since the protocols Mike described only exist in the Verus Ecosystem.
If this mechanism was implemented in the Komodo ecosystem, basically every chain in the Komodo ecosystem chain could  use it, but for now, it's only the PBaaS chains.


[26-Jun-19 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> It's kind of like that, but it's also a little more complex. For example, the Bancor equations used for converting from one fractional currency to its reserve, which are simplified forms of our equations look like this:
```
to convert reserve to fractional:
fractionalCurrencyOut = (supply * (pow((reservein / reserve + 1.0), ratio) - 1))
or to convert fractional to reserve:
reserveCurrencyOut = reserve * (pow((fractionalin / supply + 1.0), (1 / ratio)) - 1)```
These equations are solved together for all transactions in a block and all transactions in each block get the same price in either direction. That means that a 1 million Verus reserve could be used in a coin with a 10 million Verus market cap, and if people convert to the coin or use it more than convert from it, it will go up, if it is sold, the price will go down, but all coins, even to the last coin can be sold for Verus through the equations. The depth of the order book is always the entire money supply on the sell side and reserve on the buy side.


[26-Jun-19 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> When fractional reserve coins are emitted, the reserve ratio goes down. When they are officially burned, the reserve ratio goes up.


[26-Jun-19 01:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the closer the reserve ratio is to 1:1, the less volatile the currency can be relative to Verus. the further from it, the more volatile and subject to market forces.


[26-Jun-19 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> you will be able to send Verus to reserve chains and to an address on that chain. As part of that send, you will be able to auto convert it to the native PBaaS currency or leave it as Verus tokens on the PBaaS chain and convert it when you want. You will be able to send Verus tokens without gas, because you can pay fees in Verus, which will convert automatically to the native currency. You can also convert any PBaaS reserve currency to Verus with these formulas and send it back to the Verus chain as well.


[26-Jun-19 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> at first, we will be able to support Verus as the reserve currency. Eventually, I want to see it go hierarchical in Verus (reserve currencies launching reserves in their ecosystem) and to support external blockchains as well, which would mean Komodo's would be first, since they are our extended ecosystem and closest daemon to us. It will require non-trivial work to be able to do the same for Komodo currencies, but I believe that is possible sooner than any other blockchain system besides Verus. Most of the core concepts are there and the reserve system uses enhaned CCs, which would need to be ported,. The other thing is that all the pieces kind of fit together, and make the whole better with each part. For example, 50% PoS stake and non-equihash proof of power fits right into the model with merge mining support and staking of currency reserves being used to automatically purchase currencies and replenish notarization rewards without external payment. The new merge mining support and PoS security will require either VerusHash 2.0 or similar, or a double-sized block header, since the equihash space is re-purposed. It would be easiest if Komodo also had support for VerusHash 2.0, VerusPoP, but another approach could be just porting the enhanced CCs, adding the consensus changes, then integrating the merkle mountain range to improve/simplify Komodo's notarization and leverage Komodo notarization to create a reserve connector. Basically, there would be a fair bit of work and some consensus rule changes, but it can be done.

[dscrdvrsc] <IP> wow some huge stuff, great i came by to read it


[26-Jun-19 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Entire Komodo ecosystem should hardfork to PoP and Verushash 2.0!!! üòá


[26-Jun-19 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <austone> Could we do some type of Medium/other resource write-up on this? It would be great to have elsewhere and able to link to!


[26-Jun-19 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That would be amazing! Bitcoin what?


[26-Jun-19 02:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Well then that's it. That's the exchange killer. No more middlemen and any small fees go right back to the ones maintaining the network. Instant, safe, exchanges with easily convertible crypto coins. So cool thinking how much the landscape has been changing over the past year and where it could be thanks to innovations like this


[26-Jun-19 02:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> So goodbye exit scams or dead key holders. What we have been dreaming about in a true decentralized exchange, it turns out, in reality it is going to be so much more! 
Exciting just thinking about it. This is such a neat, lean system that cuts out all the fat and gets right down to business so business can get done.


[26-Jun-19 02:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I try to put my energy into making it, and I'll do more writeups after that. These are all things I'm working on now, so I thought I'd share. If other people want to work on medium articles, I can certainly edit some amount, but until this is really finished, the making of it takes the energy that would go into more formal writing than here.


[26-Jun-19 02:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> And since it's completely decentralized the FTAF regulations make an exemption for this kind of trading with respect to registration and reporting.


[26-Jun-19 02:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I recommend we not try to give legal advice unless we're lawyers (maybe you are). I've learned it's better not to. Instead, I am just working on protocols that I know will enable what people, including corporate partners, need


[26-Jun-19 02:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> but I do believe you're right üòâ no one should depend on my opinion for legal advice though, since I am not an attorney


[26-Jun-19 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> You are absolutely correct... It was my interpretation and by no means legal advice.


[26-Jun-19 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I can understand the excitement though. It is quite pretty in it's purely protocol presentation


[26-Jun-19 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> The tools are there to be used. No one gains from this, all rewards are earned and all users are participants


[26-Jun-19 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Like Bitcoin itself


[26-Jun-19 02:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> These protocols are merely tools, but tools shared in a decentralized manner cannot be confiscated which is why Bitcoin persists and cannot be governed.


[26-Jun-19 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> That's what I think once people realize will change perception to a public tool vs. a typical crypto project. That's when I think things will really change, though some corporate use might change things even before that. We will see. I'm definitely holding my Verus as BTC rises, not worried myself, but not giving any investment advice of course üòâ


[26-Jun-19 02:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I totally agree with the advice you're not giving, but that's just my opinion. üòá


[26-Jun-19 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'm holding through the btc growing pains too. And staking too! Don't forget to stake y'all!


[26-Jun-19 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Godballz Create paper wallet. Send it to that address..... No send button there


[26-Jun-19 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I can honestly say though that I can't recall a time I've been so excited and optimistic about blockchain tech and what the future holds and that I can't think of a more ambitious and driven development team either! That has my vote any day!


[26-Jun-19 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Ahhh clever @Oink haha you had a quick solution for that one


[26-Jun-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> If you want your paper wallets to stake, set up a dedicated staking wallet, (CLI ofcoarse) and import just the WIFs of your paper wallets.


[26-Jun-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I got paper wallets for all my staking addresses in my vault now.


[26-Jun-19 03:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Hmm cool idea. I do have a little pc for staking but it's just the cli and I've backed up my WIFs to paper. So sorta a flipped version


[26-Jun-19 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> @miketout wow! that's some great insight and exciting stuff! :)
Getting reserve currency a bit clearer now to understand. Thanks for the answering üôÇ üëç


[26-Jun-19 03:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> I was reading some kmd blog with PBaaS details and it was pointing to some chat snippets `https://gist.github.com/imylomylo/350b2dbe91104858ef668a434ff85e49`


[26-Jun-19 03:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> you mentioned some usecases like voting, poll, loyalty currency, liquid reserves and bancor style usecases.
I was thinking some possible use case... just trying to make sense if such use case will fit this type of blockchains which are create for specific purpose and retired/expred after use.

- I do understand the first use case of PBaaS is for example is like creating a blockchain for getting votes/polls and get results and once it solves it's purpose it gets delete/expired/archived etc.
- right now the limit is 15, but actually there can be no limit and there can by unlimited PBaaS independent blockchains made
- these PBaaS blockchains are not necessarily be just temporary but can be long term project usage too.

So, if above is correct I was thinking some other usecases.


[26-Jun-19 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> thank you for posting the link and getting the discussion going. Nice break from a challenge I'm working on. Right now, I'm trying to determine if there is an algebraic way to solve a very difficult equation, which will allow perfect efficiency with partial fills on limit orders that can be included in a block and by being partially filled, still meet their limit requirements. My default approach is a numerical iteration, which will be able to handle partial fills, but not get a perfect answer to fill them all the way up to the maximum satoshi. The formula to solve is exceedingly complex, so if you know of some exceptional algebraic gurus, please send them my way ;). I've even thought about a small, pre-trained neural net in C++, which should be able to get very close. I know how I'd do that, but it wouldn't be my first choice üòÉ


[26-Jun-19 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> all correct from my understanding


[26-Jun-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> since the blockchains are proof of some event occurred and authenticity of validity, these can be used for some interesting use cases, also in mix of IoT devices used in homes and small to medium businesses. Whenever I get some raw idea I just write them, no matter how crapy it might be, but could possibly be turn out good if worked out or may be not, so just throw it later.
so the other possible use cases could be like:
- a personal blog blockchain or some official portal for important announcements, like for governments or corporates or for any purposes. From serious or non-serious. Blogs and medium.com etc are all basically text/html, the blockchain has the bytes space to hold that data and ideally it is possible today to make such applications use case on almost any blockchain, but with PBaaS this can be automated and be managed as well.


[26-Jun-19 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> - the other can be medium to short term future kinda projects. Which are currently not so directly possible as that need bit of more work and innovation to add, more like some level of codec development in combination to blockchain integration. And if that solves, it'd be possible to add video and audio applications to it.


[26-Jun-19 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> -- that means a specific blockchain create and used to broadcast some audio/visual events. could be like sports or some other events. could be like podcast or radio type of events, but more specific to where the authenticity and history needs proof and preserved kind of ways.


[26-Jun-19 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> --- this actually was done by one dev in KMD already, a video broadcasting over blockchain, by blackjok3r.


[26-Jun-19 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> the idea with this use and throw kinda blockchain is very much like the use and throw communications mobile etc.


[26-Jun-19 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> github could very well track the changes on a blockchain for any project, for example


[26-Jun-19 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> it's very much a choice for people then to what purpose these can be fit to use. like if I want to sign up to medium.com to create a quick easy and nice looking blogs or I want to host my own Wordpress and manage it all myself, or I want to build a full PHP based application to make my whole blogging and news platform.


[26-Jun-19 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> That level of difference is all this PBaaS and Komodo's independent blockchains comparison comes to mind.


[26-Jun-19 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> anytime I try to understand a tech, I try to imagine it's use cases, that excites me more when I get that understanding....


[26-Jun-19 03:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i'm smiling because your ideas are all reasonable, and there are some people talking about each of them, though everyone has a different internal idea of the concepts, and I don't know if the people who have talked about these or similar ideas will do them or not. I do believe that some of those scenarios, especially blockchain government scenarios make more and more sense. Especially when you consider that the people staking and notarizing the chains could be citizens and earn money that would otherwise go to non-local companies to run and secure the systems. It also ties nicely into voting and registration, earning money by being involved in that process, etc.


[26-Jun-19 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> true, agree üôÇ


[26-Jun-19 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i do suspect the biggest financial use may be corporate currencies though, especially with the fractional reserve capabilities.


[26-Jun-19 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> I couldn't even imagine yet what level of applications a combination of Open AI + blockchains would make


[26-Jun-19 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> I'd really need to read and learn a bit of AI specific applications which could be useful for such use case to get better understanding and then can probably at least be able to express them properly.


[26-Jun-19 03:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> because you have solved the in between puzzle of making blockchains without requiring special servers and knowledge to create a secure and scalable independent blockchains that's few steps forward in creating some interesting applications. and that's super interesting progress! üòÉ


[26-Jun-19 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> thanks for this chat. It also clears a bit more better how Verus and Komodo fit together like lego pieces with each other in this whole picture.
It is really amazing to understand that üòÉ


[26-Jun-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I've done some work in AI, both machine learning on images, text, voice, etc. and reinforcement learning, so creating active, real time learning decision makers. Being able to leverage blockchain data with AI is definitely something I believe we should do after the fundamentals are solidly in place.

[26-Jun-19 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Here's a generic description:
https://github.com/opentimestamps/opentimestamps-server/blob/master/doc/merkle-mountain-range.md
We actually use more advanced MMRs than is written up anywhere, in the sense that we are including proof of work and stake in the MMR tree for the chain. There is a research paper that described using just work in an MMR on a proof of work chain to make an ultra-light client that can validate transactions. Their use of MMRs is closer to Verus: https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/226.pdf
Finally, the implementation is a scalable system that uses chunked memory allocation, templated node types that can include stake, work, power, nothing, or other properties. It also includes a virtual overlay on the active blockchain array (no space used for lowest layer, saving half space with nodes realized when needed). It's quite flexible and could be adapted to other blockchains as well.

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Of course, with the MMRs that Verus has, it is fully prepared to have those ultra-light validating clients made for it as well.


[26-Jun-19 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> these ultra-light validating clients would be electrum servers or would be directly talking to the existing p2p network nodes on Verus Network?


[26-Jun-19 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> if the later, then it would be super amazing! no dependency on electrum servers and more better decentralised lite clients!


[26-Jun-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763

[26-Jun-19 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> The AI talk and IoT stuff really got me. Aside from some iota uses those broad usages didn't even cross my mind for blockchain. That really is exciting! I'm picturing an android-esque mobile OS that is sort of like linux's open source in that it can learn preferences and change democratically but based on blockchain governance instead. Something like that. But man, yeah, video and audio distributed via blockchain is seems like a perfect fit both for copyright and also for more control to the artists.


[26-Jun-19 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Man it could open up all sorts of new collaborative efforts for open source development. You could make an open source video game company on PBaaS with developers from around the world and who otherwise would have never met!


[26-Jun-19 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763

[26-Jun-19 09:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> anyone here?


[27-Jun-19 05:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Roxin> @AkiraX  here..on community suport


[27-Jun-19 06:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cypher> just a heads up please mine on a few different pools


[27-Jun-19 06:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cypher> they are too centralised atm


[27-Jun-19 06:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cypher> this is bad

[27-Jun-19 06:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I agree. The hashrate should be distributed more evenly, but we cannot force people to do what we want. That's not the spirit of this community.
That being said: Because of the 50% PoW / 50% PoS consensus (Proof of Power or in short: PoP) they cannot take control of the network.


[27-Jun-19 06:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cypher> naturally however it is important to make people aware a lot of miners dont check üòÉ switching to smaller pools can mean bigger payouts but a little less regularly


[27-Jun-19 06:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @Cypher You missed a pay-streak on the pool, but your first share is maturing....


[27-Jun-19 06:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cypher> Haha not thinking personally just decentralisation xD

[27-Jun-19 11:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> this helped a lil bit understanding MMR: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mimblewimble/grin/master/doc/mmr.md


[27-Jun-19 11:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> also read the other GitHub MMR post by Peter Todd. helped a bit.


[27-Jun-19 11:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> would like to understand how Merkle Root of Merkle Roots of Merkle Roots (MoMoM) might be different to Merkle Mountain Ranges (MMR).


[27-Jun-19 11:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> will read next that pdf link of FlyClient


[27-Jun-19 11:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Found this a while back when trying to understand merkle mountain ranges, apparently also by Peter Todd. Guess he knows his MMRs.
<https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2016-May/012715.html> @grewalsatinder


[27-Jun-19 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> Peter Todd came up with MMR idea as I understand. üôÇ


[27-Jun-19 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> had skimmed through that link and next messages related to it. Guess I will need to re-read it again to try grasp it better.


[27-Jun-19 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> I get a fair bit idea how things are going with MMR after reading that Grin's MMR description, it was helpful.


[27-Jun-19 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yeah I only have a general grasp and I saved your links and the ones Mike posed yesterday to read up on. Thanks for sharing. It's not something you just find laying around the internet.


[27-Jun-19 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> true


[27-Jun-19 12:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> to be honest mathematics is my weakest skill, and only I know how I cleared my Masters with all those probability maths. üòÖ


[27-Jun-19 12:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> reading that lists link again from the start, and after reading that Grin's MMR, it is making a bit more sense now


[27-Jun-19 12:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> haven't started that FlyClient pdf to read yet


[27-Jun-19 12:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Haha yeah same here with math unfortunately. 
The stuff you said yesterday was really eye opening tbh and presented in a really thought provoking way.


[27-Jun-19 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Talking about Verus as a tool for people to get things done is really big because blockchain to many is just a game to be played but for developers to have all the work done in an orderly environment so that they can actually implement blockchain usages is a huge big first step


[27-Jun-19 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> A first step toward devices that use blockchain's unique capabilities to their full potential and completely discrete so that most ordinary people will never even recognize the tech behind the tools they use


[27-Jun-19 12:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Seems like there would be good reason for a lot of different developers and users to have a safe environment to build on or experiment even


[27-Jun-19 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I just get really excited to think about the possibilities. Really looking forward to all the different and unique use cases and how things might evolve.


[27-Jun-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> agree üôÇ It is very exciting.
The real adventure is the other possible solutions offered by the industry researches around.
You can have a look at them, try to understand them, and it is possible that may be one of them could end up in any of your favourite project.

As I understand MMR is a solution to handle blockchain bloating, and keeping the blockchain UTXO size small or manageable, like some level help in scaling as well as to make the light wallet clients better 
and securer as compare to existing protocol and data structures. I'd definitely need correction on this part if anything needs correction on this understanding.


[27-Jun-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> And since UTXO is a part of Transparent public transactions only, this scaling part applies to the 1 part of Veruscoin.


[27-Jun-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> For the Private transactions there is one more project in industry which is very interesting, Coda Project.


[27-Jun-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> Have a look around, you'll find it super interesting.


[27-Jun-19 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> I just hope that one day Coda could be implemented or at least be available as either a smart chain or PBaaS chain in future üòÉ


[27-Jun-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> If I get that right, that will be extreme scaling solution to create very very small size/lightweight blockchains.


[27-Jun-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Thanks, I will take a look!üëå 
Another cool thing about the MMRs if i understand them correctly, along with reducing blockchain bloat, it also uses only those small fractions of each to make up a whole, but in doing this all chains are verifiably connected in the blocks along with being much smaller in size. Such a cool idea and amazing the amount of information that can be efficiently organized in this fashion.


[27-Jun-19 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I'm actually hoping to see a mass exodus of serious minded projects that truly care about getting their vision accomplished. Who knows, the big centralized BaaS solutions may find that if they can't beat us, join us..


[27-Jun-19 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> it is getting harder to beat this developing tech actually. üòâ


[27-Jun-19 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> I still guess the hyped projects like ETH/Polkadot/Cosmos etc will still get major developer share from industry, but the ones who will either be looking for alternative and better freedom choice solutions in industry might end up in projects like KMD and VRSC, or the ones who will get frustrated with the shortcomings of those mentioned platforms.


[27-Jun-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> this is very new industry, and people will learn by experiencing only, and that will take them some time to end up here.


[27-Jun-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Also if it is easier to use and all the hard work is done developers may see it as the most appealing choice


[27-Jun-19 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> the problem with our low budget and technical superior projects is the level of help from the communities those big bois gets which our small projects aren't getting as much as compared to those big ones.
but whatever little or more we are getting is superbly amazing!


[27-Jun-19 01:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> It is all very new and just the past year has been a rollercoaster. I hope someone is documenting everything haha cause itd be a heck of a story

[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> completed reading that MMR newsgroup email of Peter Todd. took me two days going back and forth shuffling between other things and reading it.
I'm that slow reader. Just repeatedly read a part until I feel like I understand it's context and meaning. üòÖ


[28-Jun-19 09:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Haha I've been going down a Peter Todd rabbit hole too here- <https://petertodd.org/> and I actually looked into blur and coda that you mentioned which led me to a very cool video with a nice simple explanation of zk-snarks. Interesting tech behind both but I don't want to get too sidetracked


[28-Jun-19 09:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> have few questions now. Please note that this is coming from a blockchain core newbie:
- in MMR the TXO commitments delays play some role in it's security and validity of the txout spends. How long is this delay in Verus' implementation?
- Need also a clarity and confirmation that if Mountain Merkle Ranges are compatible and implementable on the same blockchain which uses Merkle Roots? I feel like sounding a bit silly asking this question, but just asked.
- In that newsgroup post of Peter's it says the MMR TXO commitments can be verified solely by the Full nodes as well, if they wish to, as I understand from the concept of MMR the peaks can be used to generate the path to validate the UTXO/STXO/TXO spends/unspends. With that understanding the Miners doesn't has to do the amount of work for the validation part of these MMR. If I understood this part correct, can you please clear how this validation of peaks and TXO commitments are handled in Verus? If it is validated by the miners, is that implementation applied to the stagers as well?

[28-Jun-19 10:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That's not it but essentially


[28-Jun-19 10:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> - If the MMR are only used in the PBaaS currency and not in the main chain of Verus, then I want to understand how they are working cross blockchains to keep the calculations that your algo will be doing for reserve currencies? Feel a bit confused on this part. I understand with MoMoM implementation, the Notary Nodes play a role to keep the Merkle Roots data notarised and that helps any network full nodes to validate the proof of some transaction happened on any other cross blockchain. How is this validated in PBaaS model using MMR structure ?


[28-Jun-19 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Wait


[28-Jun-19 10:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> It is part of the whole ecosystem including Verus pretty sure


[28-Jun-19 10:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> It had been implemented in one of the recent upgrades, likely the mandatory one?


[28-Jun-19 10:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> - How much data does it really save using MMR instead of traditional UTXO models? If for example I prune my full node, how will it get all the valid data if for example there are lessor of the full nodes or may be even in case there are nodes who either archived or pruned the TXO of spends from it's database to keep the size of the blockchain smaller, under MMR implementation.


[28-Jun-19 10:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I believe it is orders of magnitude smaller in size I'll have to check but I believe Peter Todd gives a rough assessment


[28-Jun-19 10:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> @Godballz cool! bookmarked that link üôÇ


[28-Jun-19 10:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Basically the video that I am going to link you describes the proofs like this- imagine I have a giant boulder and I want to prove to you that it exists. One way of doing this is that I can bring you to the boulder which would require time and effort or I can ship the boulder to you which would also require time and effort but there is a third option, let's say I take a photograph of the boulder and bring that to you, it requires less work and less time but I can still prove to you that the boulder exist and describe it to you in detail


[28-Jun-19 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> @grewalsatinder every Native wallet running is essentially a full node. The lite clients leave the work to be done by the electrum servers. So any native wallet can notarize and verify...


[28-Jun-19 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I know it‚Äôs not a full answer on your questions, but it‚Äôs a start.


[28-Jun-19 10:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> @Oink I understand your answer from existing Merkle Roots/trandtional UTXO models based. Mine are more towards the MMR based. üôÇ


[28-Jun-19 10:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> @Godballz that's nice example indeed ü§î üëç


[28-Jun-19 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> If you prune your MMR, you basically remove UTXOs that have been spent, so they no longer matter. But if you rescan the previous blocks in the chain, the pruned data s still available there. So if you want insight in the spent UTXOs you can walk back into the chain history, to ‚Äòunprune‚Äô you‚Äôre MMR


[28-Jun-19 10:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> hmm... so does that mean I don't need to connect to the rest of the nodes to unpruned my full node?


[28-Jun-19 10:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> does that also means that MMR can be overlayed or applied along with the UTXO model? I feel confused that if MMR is totally different implementation of data structure for a blockchain or is extending the existing UTXO model?


[28-Jun-19 10:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Theoretically you should be able to retrieve that data from the chain you have in store. Since every block should match the block of the same height on every other node (otherwise you‚Äôve forked away) it‚Äôs useless to ask other nodes for this unpruned data, since they too have to look it up in their chain history.


[28-Jun-19 10:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> okay, that clears at least the pruning/unpruning part. üôÇ Thanks üëç


[28-Jun-19 10:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Compare it to spending money.... you give somebody a 10 dollar note and receive back a 1 dollar note.... the 10 dollar note UTXO is gone and can be pruned and you got a new 1 dollar note UTXO on a new branch in the tree..... once that is 1 dollar note UTXO is spent, you can prune the entire branch back to the ‚Äòoldest‚Äô unspent UTXO...
those notes are no longer in your wallet, so not worth remembering.


[28-Jun-19 10:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> agree


[28-Jun-19 10:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Very important to note that we do NOT use MMRs at all like other coins. I can‚Äôt answer with details at the moment, but the discussion took a turn, and talk of UTXOs with MMR, etc don‚Äôt apply to Verus use at all. Same structure, different uses. Like I said, the closest use case is in the FlyClient paper. Nothing anyone else is doing really relates to Verus use of MMRs. It‚Äôs a tool with many possible uses.


[28-Jun-19 10:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> As far as efficiency, from a raw data structure perspective, we almost certainly have the most efficient MMR implementation there is. Finally, it is in the current release, but is not yet used until PBaaS.


[28-Jun-19 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> okay, thanks for clearing. I yet to read the FlyClient paper. Only had finished the Peter Todd's MMR text. at least got a bit of grasp where things are heading reading that.


[28-Jun-19 10:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I‚Äôll start reading the flyclient paper...


[28-Jun-19 10:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> will read FlyClient paper and get back here if I have any further questions. Thanks again @miketout üòÉ

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Thanks too! I appreciate the discussion, and I understand that there‚Äôs a lot of tech that will probably take some time for people to fully understand. After I finish with implementation, explanation will be a big priority üòÉ

[29-Jun-19 07:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> How much verus u guys think one should atleast have?


[29-Jun-19 07:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Depends on your goals... 
- A profit-miner will want to exchange ASAP to a coin that's valuable to him.
- An investor will accumulate as much as feasible to sell in future at a profit.
- A Coin supporter will get enough for staking to secure the network.
- A careful 'newbie' will get a small amount to see what he can do with it.


[29-Jun-19 07:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> I am looking at staking


[29-Jun-19 07:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> Is there a minimum amount?


[29-Jun-19 07:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> No minimum for staking...


[29-Jun-19 07:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> It aint cheap at this price too


[29-Jun-19 07:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Optimus_prime There is a staking pool which is better if you want regular rewards, look in #staking for more info.


[29-Jun-19 07:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Every coin has the same weigh on the network, so if you have 10 coins, you stake on average 10 times more often than with one coine in the same time period


[29-Jun-19 07:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> How often would you like to get a reward?


[29-Jun-19 07:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> Holding 750 now


[29-Jun-19 07:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> With 750 coins it would be wise to consider a pool, like @Crupti said


[29-Jun-19 07:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> Alright


[29-Jun-19 07:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Optimus_prime I think it¬¥s @Ginasis Mining Pools that has the staking pool


[29-Jun-19 07:54 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Ginasis Mining Pools> suppp


[29-Jun-19 07:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> @Crupti also any plans on atomic swap. Thats pretty much the future. Decred is probably leading that field now


[29-Jun-19 08:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @Optimus_prime I¬¥m no expert on this, ask @Oink - I think Verus already has Komodo atomic swap, though.


[29-Jun-19 08:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Verus has all the capabilities inherited from the Komodo chain. afaik Komodo has the atomic swap capabilities, therefore Verus can use that.
As soon as PBaaS is released we'll have a far more advanced exchanging capability between Verus and it's ecosystem chains on top of that.


[29-Jun-19 08:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cryptoon> You can already swap verus with 95% other coins using barterdex. Currently working on new marketmaker 2.0 which should improve user experience tenfold


[29-Jun-19 08:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> TY @Cryptoon


[29-Jun-19 08:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> Thanks for the into. Have been in crypto space since 2016. I thin. Verus and Beam are by far the 2 community focusing on tech in social discussions. Thats great.

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> There's lots of reading material around in this discord, but you'll have to sift through the chit-chat. The announcement channel is a good place to get info.

[29-Jun-19 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> And my i ask. With verus sharing the tech with Arrr , Hush and entire komodo community. How is it Verus would stand out although its the creator of these innovative techs? Doesnt that in long run depends on which ecosystem has better marketing strategy?


[29-Jun-19 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> We'll always have the advantage of being the first to have that tech implemented. The Komodo ecosystem may decide not to implement, or only implement parts (if possible).


[29-Jun-19 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> PBaaS is not the end of the Verus Vision. It may be worth reading the Vision Paper from out website


[29-Jun-19 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> I ask this cause I have been following verus since Nov 2018. It was around 0.08-0.1 then. Arrr waz at mere 0.03-0.02. But now the sister company ( if I may call it as such ) is way successful due to marketing strategy


[29-Jun-19 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> verus has few amazing tech:
- 51% attack resistant even without dPoW
- Nothing @ Stake solved
- PBaaS is very exclusive to Verus
- Verus Reserve currency will be very exclusive to Verus too
- Thank to Verus reserve currency, the PBaaS ecosystem very much like Komodo's Smartchain ecosystem will make it a centre of not just Verus PBaaS, but also Komodo Smartchains as well. This is also amazing in sense where you don't even worry about Atomic Swaps. It is amazingly cool tech development.


[29-Jun-19 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> @Optimus_prime  what you are really asking is what to invest to get more money. No one can tell that for you üòÉ


[29-Jun-19 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> and it's not tech that leads the prices ibviously so does not make sense to disucss such at current stage


[29-Jun-19 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> see top 20 coins - all have less tech then Verus, KMD and others


[29-Jun-19 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> @passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã @passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçãno absolutely wrong


[29-Jun-19 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Not only marketing strategy, but also development strategy. People are getting more and more aware of privacy with everything that is happening in the world around us. Basically they focus on other things than Verus.


[29-Jun-19 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> so since it got nothing to do with tech at current stage, it's market deciding the price, which nobody knows


[29-Jun-19 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> In long run tech wins but with a wity lil planing


[29-Jun-19 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> Let me expand on the first point:
- 51% attack resistant even without dPoW, that means Verus is having 3 layers protection:
- Consensus algo 50%: Verushash v2 Proof of Work
- Consensus algo 50%: Verushash v2 Proof of Power/Proof of Stake
- Consensus algo makes it 51% attack being 50/50
- Komodo dPoW notarisation is 2nd' layer of 51% attack.


[29-Jun-19 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> in the long run the world will cease to exist üòõ


[29-Jun-19 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> @passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã yea marketing for now is based on FOMO if the individual do not know the tech. And this currently accounts to 90% of crypto investors..look at Tron. Shitcoin. Even Iost is better but thats wht market relies on nowadays


[29-Jun-19 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> The community decided not to market anything until there is something to market. We can go big on selling PBaaS now, but as long as it is not implemented on main net, it'll be like selling hot air in the desert. We started to let the world know about PBaaS once it was on testnet, so people could experience it for themselves.
We are now starting to actively market Verus (K64 gaming conference in The Hague withg Micheal Tout jr for example)


[29-Jun-19 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> selling hot air on desert - I like that quote


[29-Jun-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <TopMix> can we do mining with the coin it self ?


[29-Jun-19 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> @passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã this reminds  me Cyrix. I am sure Mictoutoghni knows this. One of the best processors out there in 1990's. I was an AMD fanboy then . But Intel swept everythint through pure marketing. Cyrix is non existence now

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I didn't say he was a marketeer and I'm pretty sure he knows his limits. Doesn't mean he's oblivious to other fields of expertise... But hopefully that goes for all of us.

[29-Jun-19 09:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But we're not talking about the tech being inferior or superior. It's executed from a different vision. Verus is for the people, by the people.


[29-Jun-19 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> Advantage of Verus: Decentralization
Algorand: Finalty and fork proof


[29-Jun-19 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> Lets see


[29-Jun-19 09:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> Cause ultimately banking centers will enter. They will choose. Finalty vs decentralization. Both are 51% hash attack resistant


[29-Jun-19 09:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> I hope both could co exists but then comes Cardano  and Dfinity


[29-Jun-19 09:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> Must I add: Algorand is for the rich.


[29-Jun-19 09:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> It's not the banks that will decide this. It's a simple choice what is more important to any user of BaaS or PBaaS (I don't think individuals now). renting a chain and setting up an infrastructure to run it, or paying per notarization a chain with the complete infrastructure in place (at a lesser cost per month).
Not to mention the liquidity capabilities that will be available... I'm sure another chain will develop something similar...


[29-Jun-19 09:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Optimus_prime> Hope a pure  community project disrupts this

[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> just quick skimmed through the FlyClient pdf. It's long, and I'm feeling lazy. üòÅ 
So, I picked a better target, reading the Verus vision paper now. It clears a lot of things! I had only skimmed it earlier. now reading it all thoroughly.


[29-Jun-19 01:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> clears it that Verus is much about AI and Machine learning and what we see now is just the building blocks reaching to that point.

[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> Decentralised Autonomous Governance system, with truly verifiable and yet privacy preserving identities, along with Decentralised Reputation system for these identities


[29-Jun-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Yup, we‚Äôre barely at the beginning...


[29-Jun-19 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> I'm at part 3.1 yet


[29-Jun-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> so, as I understand the target of Verus applications is going to be segmented and it will be useable across the cryptocurrency ecosystem just because it is specialised in the specific area more


[29-Jun-19 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> To be honest I tried reading the Flyclient yesterday, but didn‚Äôt get far... decided to print all 30 pages so it‚Äôs larger than my tablet and continued reading while BBQing...


[29-Jun-19 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> I quick looked through the doc and it felt boring, so I picked something interesting to read which I hadn't fully read yet, and picked the verus papers.... üòÅ


[29-Jun-19 01:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> will get back to FlyClient later for sure


[29-Jun-19 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Hahaha... i haven‚Äôt finished either... I want to, though.... but it‚Äôs Formula 1 weekend and I‚Äôm really into that... priorities, priorities, priorities....


[29-Jun-19 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> üòÅ


[29-Jun-19 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I think the sum of the segmented applications will be far bigger than segmented chains with one application...


[29-Jun-19 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> This will have the opportunity to use functionally that may not be available on separate chains.


[29-Jun-19 01:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> agree


[29-Jun-19 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> just an Identity and Reputation alone is very strong thing in a decentralised application, to be used even by rest of the cryptocurrency space if it's solved properly and is cheap and efficient


[29-Jun-19 01:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> and Verus will also have applications like polls and voting which will result in both Decentralised Autonomous Governance and AI and Machine Learning based applications


[29-Jun-19 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> It'll be amazing for institutions to general public


[29-Jun-19 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> Indeed... the future bringing polls and voting in that manner is what made me decide to look further into Verus... AI and machine learning is a bigger thing, but for the general public less tangible. Took a while before it sunk in with me...


[29-Jun-19 01:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> It‚Äôll open a world of new possibilities.


[29-Jun-19 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763

[30-Jun-19 05:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> to be fair, i tried to read the flyclient paper, but the deep math made me want a simpler solution and i didnt read (understand) all the details in the paper, just enough to know it was very complex and since miket already did MMR, i didnt plan to do anything more than try understand it a bit. superlight clients are an easy enough to understand usecase and i realized nSPV was possible and achieved the goals of flyclient


[30-Jun-19 05:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> It‚Äôs such a simple concept, i wonder why nobody thought of this before... I bow for your ‚ÄòEureka moment‚Äô!


[30-Jun-19 05:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> there are no other notarized chains

[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I basically want it to be an addition to my retirement plan... So I'm thinking long-term... That's also why I smile upon folks getting all worked up on the rise or fall of BTC or any other coin...


[30-Jun-19 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Actually, their approach is basically the same. The only real difference is how you can trust notarizations.


[30-Jun-19 12:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> The big thing about the fly client paper is that the approach allows someone to trust an incomplete chain because the MMR-based proof of work (in Verus we do proof of power), makes it statistically impossible to present a fake chain as real, and you can then use the most work rule to select.


[30-Jun-19 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> At the end of that, just as with Verus cross-chain notarization, there is the merkle mountain range root that you can trust


[30-Jun-19 12:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> just as with Komodo notarization, there is a merkle of merkles of merkles that you can trust through the elected notarization process


[30-Jun-19 12:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I was thinking also that we should enable the PBaaS cross chain notarization to allow a trusted notary body or group of notaries, like the Komodo notaries, to be commissioned by a chain and earn as a notary group to more quickly cross-notarize a PBaaS chain, enabling faster confirmations than the fully decentralized notarization if the chain creators wanted to make that tradeoff


[30-Jun-19 12:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> This would have to be after PBaaS, I believe, but it would be nice to see an ultralight protocol that was compatible and could benefit from notaries, but work either way


[30-Jun-19 12:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> I think it's a good plan to give the choice to the creators of the PBaaS chains if they want to sacrifice (a part of) decentralization for the ability to have faster notarizations and access to the nSPV clients.


[30-Jun-19 12:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> But I fully understand too that we shouldn't expect it in the release of PBaaS on the mainnet. Remains to be seen if Komodo has that implemented by then.


[30-Jun-19 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> I will continue reading verus vision paper tomorrow 
Today was exciting day following nSPV
Any way Verus development goes with ultra lite client either just using MMR like tech or nSPV I would love to see that progress. üôÇüëç


[30-Jun-19 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> I guess both implementation can exist in parallel if I get right, nSPV and MMR based like client

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @LB what's the issue?
@bimagets best miners right now are CPUs, like AMD Ryzen R5s or R7s or others, and FPGAs. GPUs aren't fast enough yet to make a profit. That may change with PBaaS, but you should always do better on CPUs and FPGAs.


[02-Jul-19 02:05 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Crabby Paddy I don't believe we added ODA, and I don't think anyone knows anything about it


[02-Jul-19 09:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> it is not on the list to add, and it was a surprise to see the PR. we have not heard about it and really need to get PBaaS done as the priority. If there is some reason to believe it must get in before, please talk to @michaeltoutjr . Right now, we are only planning to add DP and Hemp Coin before PBaaS.


[02-Jul-19 09:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> thanks everyone for all the kind words towards devs and others contributing on a regular basis. I would also thank many of the people here who have contributed to helping us build a strong supportive community or in the case of @Oliver Westbrook and others, doing great work on development like VerusPay and web tools for Verus. We are trying now to focus on getting finished with PBaaS, as there is a Komodo hard fork in mid July, which we had hoped to upgrade alongside and are not going to, at least partially due to the extra work from the wallet and new coins. That will cost the foundation some amount of Verus directly to maintain uninterrupted notarization and we are not looking for any new work to add before PBaaS is complete. We want to have the PBaaS hard fork as soon after Komodo's fork as possible, and there is still work to be done. Devs may remain a bit scarce on the channels until after that, but we all try to check in and help periodically.

There's no need to beat yourself up over things in life, bc others will do that. So I try to keep it positive with myself... 
Verus is on the right path. Mike sounds busy, bc he is busy. And that's how he prefers it.

[04-Jul-19 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> That is an above and beyond statement from Komodo and really nice to see the appreciation for contributions from both sides that will ultimately be beneficial in the long run for everyone. üçª 
For anyone who's been paying attention and is already familiar with the always consistant, above and beyond hard word and dedication from our very own developers and contributing community members, the recent efforts may come as no surprise and seem par for the course at this point, but this instance was more than just churning out consistent work while pushing forward with a massive PBaaS release, it was an effort made that reached far beyond our own community and for that, accurately qualifies as going above and beyond. It was really nice to read some very kind words directed back to the ones who helped make that happen and see the bigger picture. üåé 
So much hostility in this space at times when we are all after the same things. It's refreshing to be a part of a healthy and supportive environment for once. ü§ò

[04-Jul-19 10:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Roki> @Godballz 
I like your take on the community as a whole.
I have always found it difficult to expend energy on the crypto community, as a whole. I have a lot of respect for Bitcoin. But I respect the idea of privacy, just as much, and so I discovered ZEC, then Komodo and then Verus. For me, Komodo is special bc of privacy, creativity and work ethic. A willingness to try to do something different, and solve a problem. It was atomic swaps that really got me interested in KMD.
And, they always seemed to be working on something. Plus, they were accessible, or seeing what was being worked on was.

And now here with Verus, we have those same principles I mentioned I like about Komodo, but we are doing it in our own way--with PBaaS. That's what creates a strong ecosystem--projects that are willing to innovate & stand on what they have built.


[04-Jul-19 10:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Roki> I never understood why some people dislike Komodo.
I stopped trying to figure that out. Because this ecosystem does contribute to everyone, whether it's dPOW or Atomic Swaps, or Verus w/Nothing @ Stake & soon to be w/PBaaS...


[04-Jul-19 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Thanks @Roki. Yeah me either. After my initial getting into crypto and acquiring the obligatory Bitcoin, after researching lots of projects, KMD was the first "alt" project I ever invested in and I still hold those very coins to this day. Seemed like a no brainer even then and they only continue to drive that point home daily. Never did see why anyone would choose eth over KMD and tbh a part of me sorta thinks there may still be some deep rooted interests who for some reason or another think it wise to hinder any other crypto related project and wrongfully view them as competition when we should all be lifting each other up like a great tide. There is plenty of room. People may be forgetting that what we aim to replace is not just simply any one market or industry, we may very well be on the cusp of a complete technological upheaval for so many things we could never even see coming and with a much farther reaching scope than the shortsighted views of those who seek to hinder progress.


[04-Jul-19 11:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> @Godballz Well you know, BTC & ETH had it out, on many occasions, and it would get nasty.. So Ethereum, it's not choosing Ethereum over Komodo. They are two different projects with different aims. 
There may be a few overlapping similarities in terms of classification, but different nonetheless. 
I think what you're describing is ego and tribalism. 
Some projects are not willing to admit, for example a weakness, and allow another project to help them.


[04-Jul-19 11:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> But I think you make a good point..
The business world is very savvy, in how they adopt new technology, bc no two businesses are the same.


[04-Jul-19 11:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I'm sure it's extremely challenging to run a multi million dollar business, year in year out, and keep that up and do it well.


[04-Jul-19 11:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> I'm hoping that PBaaS translates into the business world, that they see value in it.


[05-Jul-19 12:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oink> It's my opninion that PBaaS will be an attractive option for companies, that want to use blockchain technology. A PBaaS chains comes with a complete infrastructure, autonotarization is basically the only cost for the chain. Once reserve liquidity is implemented too (on which Mike is working to bring to testnet), there's no need to acquire listing on an exchange since Verus is listed on various exchanges. Combine that with the cross chain atomic swap capability Komodo is working on and you don't need to bring your chain to any exchange. As I understood work is being done to automatically (or at least with little effort) add any PBaaS chain to the Verus Mobile Wallet, which makes it a very attractive option for companies.
Of coarse for dApps on PBaaS chains you will still need to have developers to create and connect the dApp to the chain, but that would have been necessary for any chain.


[05-Jul-19 01:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> So would Verus have to guarantee to companies, or large users, that PBaaS will be maintained for X amount of years?

[dscrdvrsc] <CrisF> Hi @Oink üëã
You've regularly been sending me and others tips for months now.
By way of thanks I'd like to share a short story showing the results of your generosity.
I'm a new KMD Notary op and am just finishing the setup of my node.
One of the things I need for that is some VRSC.  Unfortunately mine is inaccessible at the moment.  I was a bit stuck because I didn't want to ask the other ops for some.  Then I remembered your tips.
Over the last few months the tips that you have been sending have added up to enough to fund Verus notarizations for quite some time :)
I'd like to let you know that your efforts in making this such a cool place are very appreciated.
Thank you!

[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Like what amount of wealth would make you feel content and then convert to vrsc? Way too deep question for me.

[dscrdvrsc] <Cruz> $2.8M US


[06-Jul-19 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @gamer278  I like that you think like a professional investor and wan¬¥t to know the future potential of VerusCoin in terms of the amount of Verus that could amount in "life-changing money" should everything work out? No one would know, as it is as complex to launch a blockchain as any dropping any new product into a saturated market place.  In general and current market phase, these factors must be executed correctly and in a timely manner; 

a) correct market orientation(reach early adopters), 
b) competent development team,
c) speedy development(MVP),  
d) great documentation, 
e) clear roadmap (strong team lead direction). 

This is all basic marketing stuff that I¬¥ve mentioned, and even if you get all of these correct the team still need a strong personal network and not least - LUCK. üòÜ


[07-Jul-19 05:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crupti> @gamer278 But back to your original question and say that all the above was achieved, this is not investment advice but for entertainment. Let¬¥s just use a simple market cap valuation: 

- If Verus would become one of the top 50 coins per market cap, then it would have to 20x it¬¥s current value. If your definition of "life changing money" is $1 million USD, then you would have to invest $50,000 USD in VerusCoin today. 
- If Verus would become one of the top 25 coins per market cap, then it would have to 70x it¬¥s current value and you would have to invest $14,300 USD today. 
- If Verus would become one of the top 10 coins per market cap, then it would have to 240x it¬¥s current value and you would have to invest $4,200 USD today. 
- If Verus would become one of the top 3 coins per market cap, then it would have to 1880x it¬¥s current value and you would have to invest $532 USD today.

These are just guesses based on existing top coin market caps today, and these market caps will also probably change in the years ahead.


[07-Jul-19 05:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mrbizzy> and it could be either of these. but starting with top10 would be a tough battle.

[07-Jul-19 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <grewalsatinder> I kinda assess the same way of potential of a project based on it's current supply, total supply, current bitcoin satoshi value, potential tech it offers now and what is in it's development which will be offered in future, the impact of that technology offering in ecosystem, and the effect of that tech adoption's on it's own token usage which may increase it's value as it grows. The only basic thing to understand is the technology part. In my opinion, a person who understands technology, and who also understand these basics of the economic factors which impacts the price of some unit/shares of some project/company can really take benefit by buying up some good chunk of that project/company shares.

Hi , any idea when a Verus mobile wallet (IOS) update will be available through Test Flight.? Says current version 0.1.7 expires in 7 days


[30-Sep-19 12:53 AM] michaeltoutjr#4285
@DigitalPunk If testing goes well it‚Äôs getting submitted to TestFlight today, and should be available tomorrow for iOS (estimating based on how long it takes apple to approve previous versions, technically could take a little longer)


[17-Nov-19 09:38 AM] BoBot-LunaMaxi#8821
what's the current supply of Verus and what's the max supply?

found current supply roughly 46 million

thank you


[17-Nov-19 10:03 AM] BoBot-LunaMaxi#8821
can you stake in litemode? or does wallet have to be open in native mode to stake and stay open?


[17-Nov-19 10:08 AM] Oszy#5734
no


[17-Nov-19 10:08 AM] Oszy#5734
native only


[17-Nov-19 10:09 AM] Oszy#5734
staking needs minimal cpu resources, so it has to be open all the time

        *miner terminating...

why have the miners there if you cant use them .. i spent 5h trying to figure it out, could you add a message there saying gpus not suported on the site ? so others dont go trough what i have


[07-Jan-20 05:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> @KingKillaz Did you check what miner to use and download on https://veruscoin.io/getVRSC.html ?
If I'm not very mistaken nheqminer is for CPU, so trying to run GPU's on that should take you a lot more than 5 hours to fix. Did you not read the Readme.txt when trying to troubleshoot? It does mention all over how to setup you bat for your CPU. Have a go with the CCMiner CUDA (Nvidia GPU) or the CCMiner OCL (AMD GPU) and you should be sorted üëç

[dscrdvrsc] <Robert-> Hey all does anyone know how much of an impact wallet balance has on staking?

For example if you have 500coins vs 10,000coins. Will there be a considerable difference in how often you "stake"?


[07-Jan-20 09:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Robert-> I believe there is some influence just not sure how much


[07-Jan-20 10:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> 20x500vrsc *should* stake just as well as 1x10000vrsc.


[07-Jan-20 10:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Robert-> you mean 20 wallets with 500vrsc all staking should be on par with 1 wallet with 10,000vrsc


[07-Jan-20 10:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> ‚Äúutxo‚Äù; you‚Äôre staking each transaction in transparent addresses (R\*), not the ‚Äútotal amount‚Äù in your wallet as one unit of amount.


[07-Jan-20 10:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Then you have to consider which period of time to average the result, and the variance of total staking funds on the network over time, hence luck of each address. Why __average__ is often emphasized when mentioning staking.


[07-Jan-20 10:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Robert-> can you provide an example with the param's used in the equation for solving the average?

Fill in the current blockheight and funds staking to get a guesstimate. You can't know the current total amount staking on the network, which is why it's hard to predict accurately.

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> BTW, for everyone, we are getting ready to release easy digital signing and verification of files, messages, and hashes using your VerusID, whether unisig or multisig. As you know, we currently post hashes for the Verus binary releases, and we will soon start to post digital signatures of the binary releases as well, signed by "Verus Coin Foundation@", and since the file hashes used are compatible with sha256sum, verification of the hash will be simple and easy to implement and/or use on any website without moving files around. Here are some example commands that work in the version, which will soon be released. The GUI also works, but needs some adaptation to the latest API changes, which make this compatible with the usual hashing tools:
```./verus signfile mike@ /home/user/git/veruscoin-dev/src/verusd```
returns the result:
```{
  "hash": "7a62ec3367c586fc1a39292d0e65c21e3fc9e65f772d112bdeff2ce50e08126e",
  "signature": "AW7ADAABQSCYv0sP+J3BhfSe/EU2nUfe1MXtu9ym/hKOA1GI2Ryxt1ib3GKHqbAewP+aauD/c24KgGN98j9onWUCMo3s3gA0"
}```


[09-Jan-20 10:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Notice the hash is the same as the result from the Linux sha256 tool```sha256sum -b /home/user/git/veruscoin-dev/src/verusd
7a62ec3367c586fc1a39292d0e65c21e3fc9e65f772d112bdeff2ce50e08126e */home/user/git/veruscoin-dev/src/verusd```


[09-Jan-20 10:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> then you can verify, using either the file:
```./verus verifyfile mike@ "AW7ADAABQSCYv0sP+J3BhfSe/EU2nUfe1MXtu9ym/hKOA1GI2Ryxt1ib3GKHqbAewP+aauD/c24KgGN98j9onWUCMo3s3gA0" /home/user/git/veruscoin-dev/src/verusd```
getting a simple true or false result
```true```


[09-Jan-20 10:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> or just the hash, without the file:
```./verus verifyhash mike@ "AW7ADAABQSCYv0sP+J3BhfSe/EU2nUfe1MXtu9ym/hKOA1GI2Ryxt1ib3GKHqbAewP+aauD/c24KgGN98j9onWUCMo3s3gA0" 7a62ec3367c586fc1a39292d0e65c21e3fc9e65f772d112bdeff2ce50e08126e```
and the same result:
```true```

I was reading up on PBaaS and was just curious as to the beneficial characteristics that it will offer. There's a lot that I honestly don't understand, and that's ok üôÇ "the older I get, the easier that is to admit..."

However I would like to understand more about this new technology that's currently in development as its exceedingly interesting to me. A 10,00ft perspective followed by a 5,000ft one is all I am looking for. No need to fully extrapolate on everything.

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Robert- it‚Äôs on the main website under ‚Äúpapers‚Äù. You can read about specifics on the testnet release notes for prior PBaaS testnets here: https://github.com/VerusCoin/VerusCoin/releases/tag/v0.5.9
PBaaS was removed from the testnet releases to prepare for VerusID, but will come back soon. I‚Äôm unlikely to do another write up until the next PBaaS testnet is live.

Hi, 
We've added Verus (VRSC) to http://zpool.ca/ verus. See below for connection details.

Fee only: 0.95% or less
BTC payouts are processed once a day for balances above 0.0025
Payouts for all other currencies are made automatically every 4 hours for balances above 0.05 and balances more than 0.0125 are included in one of the payouts each day.

- Sample configurations -
To mine and get paid in VRSC:
```-a verus -o stratum+tcp://verus.mine.zpool.ca:6143 -u VRSC_ADDRESS -p c=VRSC,zap=VRSC``` 
Exchange to BTC:
```-a verus -o stratum+tcp://verus.mine.zpool.ca:6143 -u BTC_ADDRESS -p c=BTC```
Exchange to BTC but mine only VRSC:
```-a verus -o stratum+tcp://verus.mine.zpool.ca:6143 -u BTC_ADDRESS -p c=BTC,zap=VRSC```

All of our ports are NiceHash friendly, no need to specify any extra details

We also provide stratum servers in:
Europe: `verus.eu.mine.zpool.ca:6143`
South East Asia: `verus.sea.mine.zpool.ca:6143`
Japan: `verus.jp.mine.zpool.ca:6143`

[dscrdvrsc] <cryptokarma> Good Question, maybe somebody has to apply for


[12-Jan-20 12:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I believe Barterdex/AtomicDEX may also be there. We did apply in the past and they asked for other exchanges with real volume that were on CMC, which didn‚Äôt exist. Then when prodded on Twitter, they said they were waiting for a response. We still didn‚Äôt have volume on CMC exchanges to respond to their question with an answer that would satisfy their question, even with continued DP/Altsbit volume. Last I heard, they had made an incomplete Verus page that looked like they were in process of listing us, so I‚Äòm not sure what they‚Äôre waiting for or if we should apply again.


[12-Jan-20 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <·Ç†·Ç¨·Ç£·ÇΩ·õï·õï¬∑·µõ ≥À¢·∂úÔº†> criteria for beeing listed on CMC are quite extensive. I started reading a bit, but I gave up üòÑ 
However, there seems to be a chance of getting listed even when not all criteria can be matched.

[dscrdvrsc] <vogelfreund88> Maybe some whale wants to swing some vrsc with his btc üòâ


[12-Jan-20 01:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @vogelfreund88 in fact, VRSC has had pretty consistent volume higher than many of their listed coins for over a year. the issue is that it doesn't have as much volume in their network of exchanges. I think DP/Altsbit has just always attracted people looking for Verus and looking to sell. Picking up volume in any sustained way needs both. I don't think a normal, self-interested whale would likely take the time to do that in any sustained manner.


[12-Jan-20 01:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Right now, it seems Altsbit API may be down. On Coingecko, I believe we have been around #350 in that range for a while, but we are dropping fast due to Altsbit not registering, which I guess is what happened on Blockfolio.

[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> <https://zpool.ca/faq>
**What currency can I be paid out in?**
*You can be paid out in any of the currencies that zpool mines and has a visible coin symbol. Non-BTC payouts depend on that coin being mined as your BTC balance is traded internally by our system to your currency of choice. If we have not or are not mining that currency your payouts will be delayed until the pool has mined the blocks for you to get paid. __If you notice in the pools status that the currency is red, it means there is not sufficient amount of the currency to pay miner(s).__ It's recommended to use BTC as any other coin could be removed at anytime and payouts will not occur. -- BTC is the only guaranteed payout currency --*

[13-Jan-20 05:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> @miketout zcash going to only privacy, all zcash forks will update to stay update with this mandatory what happend with komodo and verus.


[13-Jan-20 05:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> afaik the latest zcash updates from the Blossom update have been merged into Verus.


[13-Jan-20 09:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> but zcash only will acept Z tranfers for only privacy, T adress will disapear.


[13-Jan-20 09:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> other projects will do the change like hush, nad hush are now in a layer back from zcash - komodo - hush


[13-Jan-20 09:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> this is good and bad because if you remember Coinbase deslits zcash for that


[13-Jan-20 09:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <admon> maybe im wrong


[13-Jan-20 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> For me personally, privacy is a choice. Things I do want not to be public knowledge is done through z-transactions. Non critical stuff is for me no problem to be publicly visible.
Enforced privacy (although anyone is free to use such a chain, or not use it) will result for me that I don‚Äôt think about privacy implications on the actions I do. When stepping outside such a privacy enforced chain, I may not even realize that I have to think about privacy.


[13-Jan-20 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @admon We have no intention to drop t-addresses for numerous reasons, and I‚Äôm confident Komodo will not as well. IMO, it would be a mistake of Zcash, but that is of course their option. Rather than this discussion, please provide a link where Zcash claims they will drop t-addresses. I have not seen any schedule whatsoever from them other than an idea. I consider it a non-issue, and I think they are as likely to change their minds as to do it. If it relates to HALO, their new SNARK technology, that may be interesting enough to follow. I suspect their eventual plan will look nothing like the ARRR copycats.


[13-Jan-20 09:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> This is not a question of privacy, but of basic function, like multisig, making signatures public on purpose, or other capabilities. This being about privacy is a red herring, and the only project in my opinion that gets real credit for taking a risk and doing z-only for simplicity of the privacy message is Pirate.


[13-Jan-20 10:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> I too have yet to see anything relating to ZEC dropping taddrs, further, it will be an immense undertaking  given that 98% of their supply is in transparent addresses. I remember what it was like migrating sprout to sapling in ARRR, I can't image what it will be like for people to have to use private addresses, let alone the entire overhaul exchanges would need to do. Given what some exchanges have experienced with ARRR, it would certainly be more problematic if a higher-volume coin went all z.

On a side note: What have *9k Youtube reviews* to do with being an *agent* for an unnamed *cryptocurrency platform*? And why would anyone be interested in paying *$5* for being listed on an unnamed *beta exchange*. Better you continue your efforts in making *Knolix coin* a success instead.
On a personal note: It looks to me this is an effort to attract traffic to your site and YouTube channel to increase advertising revenue.

[14-Jan-20 11:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> DigitalPrice has rebranded to AltsBit.com a couple of months ago. You probably want to go here: https://www.altsbit.com/order?url=vrsc-btc


[14-Jan-20 01:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto278> Not sure if I missed it but does anyone know anything more about Citex exchange? Did we get enough donations to the foundation?


[14-Jan-20 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> We did not get enough donations, and we had a number of people against the idea.


[14-Jan-20 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> I don‚Äôt think anyone has mentioned it yet. Guessing other tasks has had to be prioritized for now. There is a lot of stuff going on.


[14-Jan-20 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> Ah


[14-Jan-20 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> We got about 1995 in VRSC, and we can return that to the people who donated soon


[14-Jan-20 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I had checked previously when @paia and @Crypto278 had asked, but it took a little longer than expected to get an answer. That is where we are right now, and without a lot of community support being positive, it seems like we should probably pass on that opportunity.


[14-Jan-20 02:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto278> @miketout thanks for the update.


[14-Jan-20 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I wanted to say I didn't donate a great deal on this one but mainly because I wasn't as much interested in the exchange so much as just wanting to support the idea if it did end up taking off. That being said, I don't¬† control that r-address anymore, I created it just for that purpose but I know that whatever it ends up being used for will be to benefit us all and I'm ok with that!üëç I just don't want to see it getting sent back and being locked away, forever only to be viewed on the explorer üòÇ

[15-Jan-20 11:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Crypto278 on behalf of all community devs and other contributors involved in the release process, which are quite a number. thanks :)
There are two items explained in the release notes that may make you want to stay on Agama for now, KMD interest claiming and coinbase shielding, which we expect in the next Desktop release. After those are in, we expect no more Verus Agama releases, so that will be the end of an era (of some kind üòâ )

[16-Jan-20 04:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Every native wallet is a node. Nodes can stake their balance. staking a block is the reward for that.


[16-Jan-20 04:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <vogelfreund88> Maybe we could integrate vrsc into instaswap.io and make it swapable to the most crypto‚Äôs and some fiats?


[16-Jan-20 05:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> The way instaswap works i sthat it checks existing exchanges for the best trade. It would not expand the currently existing pairs. AtomicDex does make VRSC swappable to more coins than all trading pairs currently on CEXs.


[16-Jan-20 06:05 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <carlosfusion> one question for stake you need mine at the same time? because im mining in a pool on 2 differents pc but the one i have the wallet it almost never mine, can i stake without mine in that pc?


[16-Jan-20 10:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> You only need staking to be true/enabled in the wallet to stake.


[16-Jan-20 10:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> And of course available funds to stake.


[16-Jan-20 10:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <carlosfusion> cool, and i put my private address for stake, one more question the only way to know if i get something from staking its if the private address have founds?


[16-Jan-20 11:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Funds in private addresses (z\*) are not eligible for staking. It needs to be in transparent addresses (R\*).

1) Make sure your wallet is the most recent version.
2) check the blockheight in your wallet and verify against the explorer.

[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> If you‚Äôre staking 1 VRSC, that would explain the lack of rewards.


[20-Jan-20 12:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> I‚Äôll get to my desktop.... and check what mine says


[20-Jan-20 12:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto Rich> I got rewards on Jan 2, 4, 5,6, 8 and 9 - Nothing since.  The amount of VRSC has increased slightly with each batch of rewards.


[20-Jan-20 12:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> OK, just checked my interface. I was thrown off the scent by the staking 1 coin on the top... 2.18k staking should get you an **average** of 1 stake every 20 days on the long run... Looks like you were receiving stakes well above average early this month. That's easy to get used to. Looks like you hit a dry spell.


[20-Jan-20 12:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto Rich> oh.  I liked the reg rewards. How can I get more?  (I am on an old mac air)


[20-Jan-20 12:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> if on an old Mac air, I suspect mining will not be profitable (with the electricity prices in the UK). That leaves only the option of dumping all nonVRSC coins you own and exchange them into Verus. (Obviously no investment advice).


[20-Jan-20 12:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> You may want to check the spreadsheet pinned in the #staking channel to see how much Verus you need for regular rewards. Just keep in mind that a (number for arguments sake) 50k balance doesn't guarantee 1 stake every day. It shows the statistically *average* shares per day.

[dscrdvrsc] <QuackQuack> They have some Dev docs. https://didproject.azurewebsites.net  I envision VRSC having similar developer documentation eventually as well.  But i think the first step is to have users being able to easily create their digital identities via a UI , associate IDs and any other related items

[20-Jan-20 07:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @QuackQuack In the sense that they are trying to figure out how to create a generalized decentralized ID, there is a relationship. I see the industry wide DID effort as an expensive, high-overhead, many party working group that has created a large amount of complex specification material in recent years, which represents burden of implementation, but doesn't address the challenges decentralized systems face, like truly decentralized name registration or easy revocation/recovery, the quantum transition, etc. but does somewhat force included support of DNS, URL parsing, and the centralized web. 
With VerusID, we have released a solution for decentralized systems that already works and can eventually be compatible with what they are defining, but doesn't need or want to carry the baggage they care about at its core. Of course, if people want to add those things, we have a general facility to let them.
As far as documentation, the help command in the CLI is at least as much API documentation as there is at that link, and it is complete. We don't need a large complex API for all functions we believe matter.
We will certainly have better documentation and writeups at some point, but I don't think that is a barrier as much as people understanding that they can use it worldwide already. We are not in that working group, but we have implemented and released a protocol that addresses what the DID working group is trying to achieve at its core without the requirements that carry the existing centralized web along with it. It is decentralized, and they are trying to make something that accommodates decentralization as well. As a result, I have been keeping tabs on that effort, and we should be able to interop with that protocol just fine if it becomes important.

[dscrdvrsc] <verusmike> Hi all.  VerusCoin noob here.  I would appreciate some help understanding Staking.  Can I LOSE any coins if I stake?  I've read whatever I can find on staking (Google fu must be weak) and I sort of get the concept, but would like some clarity.  Especially regarding my losing coins question.  I'm all for dedicating some hashing power to the greater good (and more coins for me) but I like to keep what I mine.  TIA.


[22-Jan-20 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto278> @verusmike you do not lose coins!


[22-Jan-20 05:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <verusmike> That's good to hear, @Crypto278  As I don't fully understand staking, I want to make sure it's not "gambling" in the loosest sense of the word.  I don't do "gambled and lost." üòÜ


[22-Jan-20 06:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <verusmike> Looking at the Stats Page: The #2 miner has 1 worker and hash rate of 1.45G/H.  How the heck do you get that hash rate with 1 computer?  I have several dual core Xeons/Opterons (older, but still) in my rig and I get anywhere from 10MH to 29MH from them.  1.45GH?  What the heck?


[22-Jan-20 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <altaran> multiple computers...same worker name


[22-Jan-20 06:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @verusmike, this should help get you going if you haven't already read it- <https://medium.com/veruscoin/how-to-earn-vrsc-solo-mining-with-your-cpu-and-staking-mined-coins-aa27da76882c>
Mining and staking are different but both can be done to help support the network and earn coins doing it. Mining depends on your hashpower and staking is based on how much you hold in a staking wallet. Verus works on a 50/50 Pow/Pos algorithm where both are equally important. The algo has been designed to be inclusive of most modern hardware with CPUs performing the best at the moment. You might also want to make sure your older chips have the instruction sets that are used when mining.


[22-Jan-20 06:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <verusmike> Thanks, altaran and Godballz.  Multiple computers, same worker name makes sense, but how do you tell if one worker goes down?  I'm sure that guy must have some script or something running that alerts him somehow.   So far, all my CPUs mine VerusCoin just fine.  I was expecting a dual Opteron 6378 (2.4GHz base clock)  running 30 threads to do better than 10/11MH/s, but they are old.  They were also dirt cheap to buy...you know how this goes.


[22-Jan-20 06:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <verusmike> Quick question about the Agama wallet.  As long as I have my WIF/seed, I should be able to move the wallet to any machine simply by reinstalling Agama wallet on the new machine and entering my seed, correct? TIA.


[22-Jan-20 06:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yes but a WIF/seed is good for one address each in the wallet. If you want to import more than one address you'll need the corresponding WIF/seed for that wallet. The wallet.dat file contains everything but digital files always run the risk of corruption eventually so it is recommended to keep both backed up and in a safe place, just to be safe.

[23-Jan-20 05:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Run a daemon, or wallet in native mode, which downloads the blockchain to your device. Keep the blockchain running and in sync, with staking enabled, and the the weight of your funds will compete against the rest of the staking funds on the whole network in solving POS blocks. Larger amount of funds will be more likely to solve a block. If you solve a block your funds in that particular winning transaction(utxo) will be sent back and forth once to validate, in which you get rewarded a block reward, currently 24vrsc.

[dscrdvrsc] <allbits> I'd just like to express how impressed I am that the team made the strategic decision to spend so much time and effort laying the foundations for decentralization.  Seeing the end result coming to fruition now is extraordinary.

We can now observe how the focus on secure PoS and CPU friendly PoW works to create a very decentralized network. >2500 nodes and now we'll see even more as the ease of use of Verus Desktop comes into play, making it so easy, and even fun, to solo stake and mine.  Add to this the interesting easy-onboarding ideas like single download with bootstrap, appeal of the Verus Desktop to other coin communities as a superior wallet, ARM-ready builds, etc

Super impressive strategy and foresight!!

[29-Jan-20 10:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> @QuackQuack I've also expressed how poor the "new logo" is compared to the old one. No offense to the creator but if this is the new logo, as apparent in the Verus Desktop, it looks very amateurish.


[29-Jan-20 12:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Most people who have weighed in have really liked the new Logo. It's a bit late at this point, since all of the apps have been rebranded with it, and we are going to have a new website in the near future. Personally, I like it a lot, as do many people who have weighed in. At the same time, there is likely no design that everyone would like. There were definitely people who provided feedback early on and participated in making changes. @bishop I hadn't seen your comments earlier. Not sure if you gave the designer, @Meyse,  feedback, but he has been working on it and changing it for some time with input from many in the community and some external designers as well. There may be some opportunity to adjust polish in later versions, but this is what will be the logo in the coming rebrand of apps/website.

[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - Monkins> every single trade on KuangEx seems to have about 3 decimal points in the VRSC amount as its cacluated using a random number generator about the mean value.   if you look at altbits a lot of the trades are round numbers as its real people trying sell orders etc.. #just_Saying #discuss


[29-Jan-20 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jintaa> @miketout tbh, 1. Openly expressed comments on the logo wd conceivably skew positive, since the designer is an internal community member with full visibility of all negative comments, and 2. If I remember correctly, lower approval sentiment earlier on was met with something along the lines of it's still a work in progress, so many likely took that to heart, expecting the final product to be noticeably different. In any case, I understand it's a moot point at this juncture, and I'm sure we're all perfectly happy to continue focusing on the main reason we're all here- to support the realization of the next revolutionary advancement in blockchain technology.

[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> One time on AAcoin, I actually managed to catch one of the fake orders My order sat for a month, unable to cancel, but wouldn't fill. Until finally a real sell order came through

[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> Hell, one could punch in a "V" in dafont and see what looks like an interesting logo to base things off, for instance, https://www.dafont.com/qbicle.font?fpp=200&psize=l&text=V

[29-Jan-20 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> and if someone could point to where the vote was for this new logo design, that would be great too


[29-Jan-20 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Panho> When I look at the new Verus logo, it seems to me that something is missing. Some key terminating element is missing.
It seems to me Verus in the incarnation of his logo - this is not just the letter "V" a little pounding on the heart.
I'm not a designer though ... ü§î


[29-Jan-20 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rozo> The logo was extensively covered and discussed in the marketing meetings over several weeks and yes there was a verbal vote and it was finalized in a marketing meeting a little over a week ago because we've got to move forward with all of our marketing plans


[29-Jan-20 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rozo> There's a hundred different things to consider when thinking about making new logos and designs and I'm not a professional designer by far but it's not my first rodeo either. I think @Meyse took the right approach and hit the nail on the head considering all the variables and criteria.


[29-Jan-20 06:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rozo> The thing to consider is most logos are made for regions and to suit a particular crowd, where Verus has to appeal to everybody and be a instantly recognizable image globally. Not to mention resemble a V as well if possible. Remember the logo has to speak to all languages.


[29-Jan-20 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <rozo> And this is just the start so you can imagine how hard it can be.


[29-Jan-20 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> it just looks like a sloppy heart IMHO


[29-Jan-20 06:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> oh well, apparently it's all decided so no sense bitching but in no way is the new one better than the old one. About the best thing to come about all of this though, was dropping coin and just branding as Verus


[29-Jan-20 06:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <QuackQuack> Yes, no sense for us to complain about. It just doesn't have a high quality appeal, looks like something pump and dump coins would do, or high roi master nodes. But no sense crying over spilled milk


[29-Jan-20 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <QuackQuack> Move forward with other items. Guess it can change in the future


[29-Jan-20 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Panho> The new logo leaves the impression that:
-the creators sought to simplify it as much as possible and succeeded in this to the detriment of the meaning of the project (Verus as money - for example). And now it seems that this is the logo of the manufacturer of children's toys or sweets üòâ ;
-the creators sought to avoid associations with the ass, which could arise from harmful haters in the future. And so the logo turned out to be such a strained blue heart. If it was necessary to follow the path of associations with the heart - something radical would be a simple heart emoji.
I apologize to those to whom my spontaneous review seemed too harsh. üôè


[29-Jan-20 07:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> There was discussion among all contributors in the development and marketing discussions and on numerous channels here. This has been in progress for months now. There was no vote, just lots of open work here and discussion. What we have now represents quite a few contributors in the community working very hard for months, trying to take all feedback from everyone who would give specific feedback. We don't have a lot of professional designers, but this was done by one, and based on companies or groups I've led in the past, where I was involved in logo design, he's done a fantastic job, IMO. Some of the people who weighed in and really liked it included artists and other designers, as well as companies building on Verus. Some people weighed in about earlier versions, and I believe they were involved in discussions. I believe one person who expressed feedback may have had some personal issues that made it so they were not deeply involved. If there is constructive feedback for later versions, and instead of duplicating months of work, people offering feedback would prefer to contribute ideas or effort to the large amount of work already being done for the project and community, please connect with @Meyse or me. Thanks.


[29-Jan-20 07:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Panho> I do not pretend to be a designer at all, and due to some personal problems I cannot be deeply involved in the process.
This is my humble opinion of the participant. What could be the solution?
Only a path in development  üòâ  Make a ‚Äúlogo‚Äù section and let the community create. And do not rush into it.
Because the new logo cannot be called hopelessly bad :). And in a year or two, hold a powerful promotion, and then vote using the Verus blockchain. This will greatly contribute to the dissemination of ideas and the adoption of Verus.
Something tells me that the founding fathers already have such plans.  ;)
I apologize if I unreasonably got into a marketing strategy. üôè 
But I can definitely say that the new logo evokes emotions and does not leave you indifferent (no matter with which sign) - it will definitely stimulate   üôÇ


[29-Jan-20 08:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cybertrucker> I, for one, really like the new logo. It looks modern and sleek and gives positive vibes with the heart.

[dscrdvrsc] <LC> hi im new to verus coin or bitcoin. have you any advice for mining as a beginner


[30-Jan-20 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> As a beginner, I assume you don't have heavy mining equipment. Mining can be done 'solo' in the native wallet (powerfull processor recommended), or to a pool using an external miner for smaller, but regular payouts.

[30-Jan-20 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> VerusCoin is mainly mined with CPUs. GPUs are less efficient and FPGAs are not on our network at this moment, but we're not trying to keep them off our network. The mining algorithm is specifically designed to include FPGAs, but keep CPUs competitive and profitable.

[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> It's downloading/synchronizing until the latest block.
If you turn off the wallet for hour, it'll have to download around 60 blocks at that startup.
Off for 24 hours should mean 1440 (24*60) blocks download that time.

[31-Jan-20 06:12 AM] Gateway#3763

[31-Jan-20 06:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <LC> yes lol i am new to this but i dont know


[31-Jan-20 06:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> I can't say yes or no to that.


[31-Jan-20 06:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> I believe only you can find out for yourself


[31-Jan-20 06:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <LC> ok thanks


[31-Jan-20 06:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> And, is it about making a few cents today, or positioning yourself for when the block reward is much smaller than it is today, likely meaning a more valuable asset then?


[31-Jan-20 06:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Example... on my best day, I mined 3840 VRSC in the early days.   That is worth about 300 USD today.  So, while I did not know it at the TIME - VRSC was definitely profitable then and, if you can mine and HOLD - likely will be quite profitable.  If you want to mine and DUMP - just do nicehash.


[31-Jan-20 06:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mosquito> Nicehash supports this algo?


[31-Jan-20 06:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> No.  But if you want to make money today... then just do nicehash


[31-Jan-20 06:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> That was my point


[31-Jan-20 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <LC> ok thank you


[31-Jan-20 06:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <LC> is Bitcoin profitable


[31-Jan-20 06:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto278> @LC no one can predict that question. Do not invest any money you can not afford to lose. My opinion Verus is going places. Mine it, stake it, buy it and hold for now. Do you own research watch YouTube videos, read in between the lines on those videos you might be  surprised at what you indirectly learn. :)


[31-Jan-20 06:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <LC> ok thanks


[31-Jan-20 06:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto278> @LC get familiar with Verus wallets, spread the word to friends. Show them how to use it, buy etc. Not easy for newbies but very easy to learn. Explain Verus to people. We are in a middle of a rebrand right now. New website should be ready soon.

[dscrdvrsc] <OGAds> how much is the reward for finding a block solo?


[31-Jan-20 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> 24 VRSC + fees included in that block.


[31-Jan-20 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OGAds> thanks


[31-Jan-20 08:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <OGAds> so if i add my wallet on 3 more pcs and solo mine will all 4 pcs be working together to find a block? or each pc will be trying to find its own block?


[31-Jan-20 08:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Each PC will be trying to find a block on its own. But if all PCs have a statistical probability of finding a block in, say 20 days, you will see that you find blocks more often, corresponding with 4 times that chance, so 4 blocks in 20 days.
Statistically you should then find 1 block every 5 days

[dscrdvrsc] <rozo> Musakhan is a Palestinian Arab cuisine dish, composed of roasted chicken baked with onions, sumac, allspice, saffron, and fried pine nuts served over taboon bread. It is also known as muhammar.

[dscrdvrsc] <·Ç†·Ç¨·Ç£·ÇΩ·õï·õï¬∑·µõ ≥À¢·∂úÔº†> @moriarty @Morty I think this channel is a better place to post spammers/scammers. 
but again, also @dASH and all others:
If anybody feels spammed or scammed, please report those to discord: https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000029731  , because just banning them from our Verus discord might not have a permanent effect. 
How to get the long ID: Click on User Settings (the gear on bottom besides the headphones), go to Appearance (!) and activate Developer mode, then you can right-click on a user and copy the ID.

[dscrdvrsc] <CrisF> Hi @castlejack, I noticed when I tagged you in the tipbot channel.  We've had trouble with people impersonating community and team members in the Komodo discord and now have a bot that bans people who try and take the names of team members.  Scammers can even copy the `#~~~~` at the end of names.

[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - Monkins> It would seem a Microsoft office plugin to connect to a wallet and sign a document would be very scary to the above paid model


[02-Feb-20 10:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - Monkins> It would also be possible to have a plugin that charges in VRSC a customer who wants to purchase  some verified documents . so they are not only getting a document that is signed by the verified identity . but they are also paying direct to that identity. how elegant and powerful solution that would be !

[dscrdvrsc] <Ted> Can we get this?


[04-Feb-20 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> why does the wallet take days and days to load while you are mining


[04-Feb-20 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> Also are they coming out with new FGPA to over take the cpu mining once again?


[04-Feb-20 10:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Are you exaggerating with "*days and days to load*"? If you're mining your cpu busy mining, it'll take longer to load any application. But if you mean downloading/synchronizing the blockchain that can take days if you don't bootstrap and doesn't have much to do with your mining.
The 2.1  algo has been made to better leverage cpus vs fpgas, so "over take" is still uncertain as there isn't a fpga bitstream on the market yet.


[04-Feb-20 10:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> @zpajk That's bs it downloaded in 1 day while not mining. While  mining it has been 2 days and i am at 38% loading the wallet on my main computer. So it dos seem like yeah it does have alot to do with your cpu working hard?@zpajk


[04-Feb-20 10:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> no i am not wasting time on the bootstrap at this point i bet if i stopped mining  and closed the wallet and reopened it it would be done by the morning. I don't want to stop mining eventually it will download fully

[05-Feb-20 03:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> @Ted Verus will be perfect for voting once PBaaS is on mainnet, since it will be scalable, secure and decentralized. Verus IDs are a key component to this. Most other chains we know of do not have an ID system like Verus, and to be both secure and scalable at the same time, they have to be centralized. That means  you have to trust some entity running the chain if you want to trust the voting results. This is all about the impossible trifecta of blockchains, that you can't have all three components of security, scalability and decentralization. That has been the belief since Bitcoin launched, but is now slowly being changed with Verus getting traction. Once PBaaS hits mainnet I hope that either our devs or some external party will build on it to enable polls and voting, as soon as possible.


[05-Feb-20 04:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> @Faketoshi Nokamoto If you are mining solo from the wallet you are in fact wasting time by not downloading the bootstrap first. The wallet can neither stake nor mine before the chain is 100% synced up and on the right chain, since it can't contribute to the chain by verifying the next block. If it took 2 days to sync up to 38% I am sure you will be up and running a lot faster by going with the bootstrap than waiting for an unknown amount of days. The bootstrap helps your wallet to not get stuck on known difficult blockheights. If your wallets gets stuck on a known fork height it will have to be reset again anyways, and it is not easy to avoid that without the bootstrap. As @zpajk suggested your CPU is actually busy checking each block created since May 2018 when wallet is syncing. Why do you think it takes so long? Trying to mine at the same time is pointless since it can't actually mine anything. If anything it will only slow down the progress of syncing. My suggestion to you is if you don't understand the answer provided by a Verus veteran contributor, just ask for some clarification or further explanation. Most people here try to be helpful, and they do so with nothing in return but the response from the people they help. Calling "bs" on the information you get based on assumptions and say you won't waste time doing what is suggested will probably not give optimal results. Just my 2 sats üòÑ

For KMD the procedure is similar, just the correct data location is `/Users//Library/Application Support/komodo` and the bootstrap can be downloaded from  https://dexstats.info/bootstrap.php

[dscrdvrsc] <DCAL4> Terrible news about Altsbit. Is this a situation where users who had funds stolen but also have VerusID‚Äôs with revocation rights could recover their funds or freeze them?


[06-Feb-20 04:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> This is such a situation: yes.


[06-Feb-20 04:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Unless the funds were already moved out of the ID at the time of discovery of coarse


[06-Feb-20 05:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> But MultiSig IDs would have prevented funds to be moved out without knowledge


[06-Feb-20 05:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> so this could be a solution for exchanges?


[06-Feb-20 05:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> It would be a good security feature for an Exchange to use VerusIDs in this fashion


[06-Feb-20 05:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <DCAL4> I hate to see something like this happen and I hope people can recover their funds. One thing that is certain though, if one or more people prove that they recovered their funds through various ID this could be a game changer for Verus. Never before in history has someone been able to say that they recovered lost funds by activating a feature of a protocol, it would make huge waves. Let‚Äôs hope we can see VerusID in action today


[06-Feb-20 05:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> How are people going to recover anything.... this would have to be the exchange implementing the verusid's to recover from, not the users...


[06-Feb-20 05:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <scubapanda> I don't know how Verusid works but how could an exchange accept funds for trading they don't have 100% control of?

[06-Feb-20 05:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> And even if the exchange did, that would only really apply if the hacker (which they always do), moves coins immediately to an address they control.


[06-Feb-20 05:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <DCAL4> Right, so from the exchange primary wallet to an account wallet on the same exchange that is under the ID authority/control,  but if it is sent to a wallet not under that ID control it‚Äôs in the wild and gone. Makes sense


[06-Feb-20 05:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> If an Exchange would use a multi-sig ID for their main wallet, it would always require more that one account to transfer the funds. Unless you keep those two IDs in one wallet, nobody could transfer without another ID agreeing on it.

[06-Feb-20 05:24 AM] Gateway#3763

[06-Feb-20 05:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> I'm still getting up to speed but it sounds like the hot wallet wasn't hacked, rather their site's DB was allowing the hacker to be credited and then have withdrawals go through


[06-Feb-20 05:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Don't know what happened exactly. We'll just have to wait on information about that


[06-Feb-20 05:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <DCAL4> Woah...so a possible flaw in the exchange software


[06-Feb-20 05:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> Now to be fair, even if the DB was hacked, there still would need to have hotwallet funds available to allow withdrawals so it's poor wallet management on their part to have a large number of coins on there. It's even more strange that they only lost 1000 or so KMD out of like 50k... so they partially managed SOME of their wallets but not all?


[06-Feb-20 05:28 AM] Gateway#3763

[06-Feb-20 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <vogelfreund88> Kraken or liquid would be nice üëç. Binance,hotbit,okex,huobi,kucoin and all the other Chinese hustle exchanges are not more safu then altsbit... shady as fuck!

Dear users,
Unfortunately we have to notify you with the fact that  our exchange was hacked during the night and almost all funds from BTC, ETH, ARRR and VRSC were stolen. 
A small part of the funds are safe on cold wallets.

[06-Feb-20 10:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - Monkins> there are tools on linux to encrypt folders. I guess the wallet.dat files were compromised or they did dumpriv keys or just did `./verusd  sendmany ..` I hate these scum..

[06-Feb-20 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SkygatesDad> OK, Rookie Miner here, let the teasing start. üôÇ  Over the past 2 weeks I discovered mining and the entire decentralize process and I am hooked. I have started with VerusCoin for no particular reason other than it seems like a good place to start and with the LuckPool experts.  I have a huge (smile)  6.85 Balance of VerusCoin in my Agama wallet.  while I am standing up more CPU units to mine is there a guide or preferred video on how to move from VerusCoin to USD or BitCoin.  Appreciate the opportunity to learn from and with you all.

[dscrdvrsc] <DCAL4> @SkygatesDad Welcome to the mining world! You picked a great place to start. I have mined 20+ projects and invested in more. VerusCoin is one of the ones I am most excited about. Truly doing some ground breaking innovation here. 

I will never forget the first time I saw a balance of mined crypto when I first mined Ethereum back in mid 2017...what a rush. I have been hooked on crypto ever sinceüòÄ


[06-Feb-20 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SkygatesDad> Thanks @DCAL4 !  What tool do you use to get usd out of Verus? I like to learn the whole process as I ramp up.


[06-Feb-20 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <DCAL4> @SkygatesDad With most Crypto you will need to exchange it to Bitcoin and send the Bitcoin to an exchange that has a fiat on-ramp where you can sell your bitcoin for USD. Personally, I have never sold any of my Verus as I believe the value will be much higher in the near future.

[dscrdvrsc] <Ted> stex is ok


[06-Feb-20 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BigCat45> Well, Stex is ok, but it's KYC. Not everyone likes that. Graviex is ok too, but I had my share of problems with them. Besides, "Graviex is a cryptoasset exchange located in Malta" but run by Russian guys... I would never even think about making big deposits there. AltsBit is done for me, and realistically the only place to go now is atmicdex, which is actually very good once you get used to it.

[07-Feb-20 10:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <MoneyBadger> I gave atomicdex a spin a while back to test it out... Worked nicely but couldn‚Äôt see the order books so felt like trading ‚Äúblind‚Äù in a way


[07-Feb-20 10:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SantostheGreat> thats why i havent used it yet


[07-Feb-20 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <austone> do you know how long it takes for trades to go through? I was trying a test trade and it says step 0/3 order matching on the trade details page


[07-Feb-20 11:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <austone> I haven't looked through atomicdex's documentation so I'll do that as well


[07-Feb-20 12:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto278> @allbits I dont see any order book where are you seeing this. Do you have to have BTC in your wallet to see it. If so that is the issue I want to know how much is on the order book before I make a deposit.


[07-Feb-20 12:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Right now, you do need coins in the wallet to see the orderbook for that coin


[07-Feb-20 12:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> It's like any other address, so yes, you can.
However: the general advice is not to mine to an exchange. (Although you should be able to import that address into your native wallet)

[07-Feb-20 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <MoneyBadger> It‚Äôs been said a whole bunch before but probably the only thing holding back exposure to this amazing project is the exchange situation. People I‚Äôve recommended this project to always seem somewhat put off by that aspect. Will come in time I‚Äôm sure tho


[07-Feb-20 01:20 PM] Gateway#3763

[07-Feb-20 01:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <MoneyBadger> That doesn‚Äôt change the fact that if you want adoption your project needs to be reasonably accessible


[07-Feb-20 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto278> @MoneyBadger agreed we have to be on at least one decent exchange. Then other exchanges might follow.

[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> KMD and its assetchains not spinning up in Verus Desktop v0.6.4-beta

1) stop Verus Desktop and wait for it to shutdown completely.
2) In the folder you extracted the archive (which will be the base for any paths referenced), go to `resources\app\assets\bin\komodod\win64\`
3) Select all files and copy them.
4) Go to `resources\app\assets\bin\win64`
3) create the folder `komodod`
6) go to `resources\app\assets\bin\win64\komodo` and paste the copied files here.
7) start Verus Desktop

[08-Feb-20 05:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cryptopoli> its Lite mode!


[08-Feb-20 05:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> I'll need to test that first...


[08-Feb-20 06:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> I just tested and confirmed. Already notified the devs about it.

[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> It's not something I can whip up a quick work-around for


[08-Feb-20 06:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <DLT Novice> I downloaded the full blockchain. Still no feature to add a seed to do mining / staking...


[08-Feb-20 06:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <DLT Novice> Any workaround for this. I have too many assets on the same seed / address to move them all to new addresses. Any config i can alter to get native mode verus coin onto my seed or address


[08-Feb-20 07:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Thinking, tinkering and testing some stuff to get around that


[08-Feb-20 07:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> @cryptopoli It looks like OOT has some some connectivity issues on on of the electrum servers. It's not something in the software,


[08-Feb-20 07:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> @DLT Novice If you have any native mode KMD asset chain other than VRSC running in Verus Desktop, you can go to `settings` --> `coin settings`, choose the asset chain you are running and issue this command:
```
run convertpassphrase "your complete seed phrase"
```
The response will give you the information you need to import.
To import choose `VRSC` as chain and run:
```
run importprivkey "The WIF you got from the earlier command"
```


[08-Feb-20 07:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> @cryptopoli Go to `settings` --> `General settings` and select the `electrum` tab, and select `custom electrum servers`. Then `save` and restar your Verus Desktop. That should enable you to connect (for now)

[08-Feb-20 07:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <DLT Novice> So i have to load a VRS in lite mode then run the command? becasue if i load a verus it will create an address


[08-Feb-20 07:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> No, VRSC needs to be running in native mode


[08-Feb-20 08:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <DLT Novice> ok says loading block index


[08-Feb-20 08:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <DLT Novice> So is it correct when i loaded verus in native it gave an address, now that command over wrote it or there is now two running

[dscrdvrsc] <AkiraX> What's the status of altsbit


[08-Feb-20 08:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <DLT Novice> well its loading block index now so ill see if it gives me an address and balance


[08-Feb-20 08:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> It will add the new address to your wallet. No command will ever delete an address from your wallet


[08-Feb-20 08:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> If we need to talk more about this, we should take it to #community-support


[08-Feb-20 09:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @DLT Novice & @ùôäùôûùô£ùô† just a note. In all cases I‚Äôve tried, you can import the seed phrase from other Komodo ecosystem wallets without any conversion. I‚Äôve always imported my seed phrases directly.


[08-Feb-20 09:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Never tried that. That would mean that the command `run importprivkey "your complete seed phrase"` should suffice...
Another day lived, another thing learned.
TY


[08-Feb-20 09:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Ah, no.


[08-Feb-20 09:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> You import it with the GUI from the import key menu. I‚Äôm not at the screen, but I did mean GUI to GUI.


[08-Feb-20 09:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Ah, I haven't discovered the import key menu in Verus Desktop yet. In Agama I've done that too


[08-Feb-20 10:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <DLT Novice> i have done the run command and it did import but placed the address as a potential receive address only. I cannot get it as the main address or to be the one used in mining/staking


[08-Feb-20 10:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <DLT Novice> Anytime in the Destop to do a light mode you can place your seed, but in the full download it makes you a new address, no ability to add a seed to load to then mine

[dscrdvrsc] <SafeCoin> Hi there, Jeff with SafeTrade here.   I've been asked by a few notable individuals in the Verus community to do an immediate listing (no KYC, no personal info, high security, we check all our withdraws etc).    We've never done a listing without consensus, though.  So I'm posing the question here.  Our node is synced.


[08-Feb-20 12:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <DCAL4> Would absolutely love to see VRSC on SafeTrade


[08-Feb-20 12:05 PM] Gateway#3763

[08-Feb-20 12:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <noon e> I would personally prefer safe.trade over other 2 exchanges.


[08-Feb-20 12:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @SafeCoin Jeff, I've been heads down on the release and other things. Thanks for posting to the community here and your offer. I'd also defer to the community on a listing like this, and listing on SafeTrade seems to have good community support right now. When you say check all withdrawals, is that automated or human process? Let me know if you'd like integration help, including Z-support or support for IDs as addresses. I'll get back to you on DM and we can discuss any necessary details.


[08-Feb-20 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SafeCoin> Thanks very kindly @miketout , withdraws are manually checked past an agreed-upon size limit and frequency.   Automation takes the cold out of cold wallets imho.    
We can do T or Z or in the near future both.   Would be happy to work with you on adding VRSC specific features.


[08-Feb-20 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - Monkins> is manual scalable?


[08-Feb-20 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - Monkins> I do enjoy my bank having 3 day transfer to another bank in certain circumstances.. so I see the benefits of checking. ps only because of the current limitations of fiat. obvs


[08-Feb-20 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SafeCoin> Definitely.  If the consensus is for high limits (mostly automated), we can do that.  We try to tailor it to what the project wants.   A lot of our projects prefer the low limits (the supporters) but it's custom to every coin.


[08-Feb-20 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> I would definately prefer low limits, from a vulnerability point of view. I'd rather wait on a big withdrawal with a certein degree of certainty that the coins are there....


[08-Feb-20 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SafeCoin> to better answer your question both approaches should be scaleable, yes.  Z-addresses are also starting to become far more scaleable.

[09-Feb-20 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CiPhEr> checked out safe trade, i wasn't even able to find an 'about us' page. There are some scattered flattering comments from themselves about themselves on their site but I couldn't find any definitive info on how exactly they differ from anyone else. 

They say they are honest but don't give any examples on how they are. They say they focus on safety and privacy yet fail to provide any examples such as cold storage, certain security protocols, etc etc.

As any exchange out there remember guys minimize your exposure. Dont leave funds on exchange more than a few hours just to do the trade and get the heck out.

[09-Feb-20 11:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CiPhEr> that sounds great, but why go to such great lengths to hide this information i'd suggest having an about us page so people new to you like me can learn all the good things easily


[09-Feb-20 11:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mofatness || Safe.Trade> No great lengths to hide. The Discord link on SafeTrade takes you to SafeCoin, our main page. SafeTrade does not have its own Discord, because it is part of  SafeCoin.

[dscrdvrsc] <SecretRecipe> D:


[09-Feb-20 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paul0215> @SecretRecipe  how many coins are you staking ?


[09-Feb-20 05:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <DLT Novice> what is the considered minimum to consider staking? 10k - 30k?


[09-Feb-20 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <noon e> There is no minimum, any amount has probability to stake, but as expected it varies with amount. As of now, with 100% coins staking one would need 53k to stake once a day. But of cause less then that is staking, I would say yes, with 30k or above you can probably stake one bock a day.


[09-Feb-20 06:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <franky2times> @SecretRecipe I hit 3 with very little I think it‚Äôs just luck lol


[09-Feb-20 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <DLT Novice> Yes i only have 10k staking. Wondering to buy more but if i look at the math i think holding KMD and getting 5% per month compounding with no need to have an active laptop holding the blockchain... Am i right? Keep the KMD or buy 20k more Verus for the staking profit?


[09-Feb-20 06:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <DLT Novice> another side to the equation is the low market cap and lack of places to buy verus presents a massive upside, not to mention the skills set of the dev team. Well above most other platforms.


[09-Feb-20 06:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SecretRecipe> @paul0215 a few hundred


[09-Feb-20 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paul0215> Yes as you can see above statements it takes a few thousand to get a stake quick.


[09-Feb-20 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paul0215> @SecretRecipe


[09-Feb-20 07:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BigCat45> Correction: KMD is cold staking, 5% per year. If left unclaimed for more then a month, there is no staking on that amount. You need to claim it monthly.


[09-Feb-20 07:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <DLT Novice> yes but the claiming process is a one click problem.


[09-Feb-20 07:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BigCat45> Yes, well I have HEAT too. Diversification is the key.


[09-Feb-20 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <CiPhEr> passcombo- i don't know if associating verus with ico's is what we really want as most, if not all icos, are scams.


[09-Feb-20 07:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> @DLT Novice It's still 5%/year if claimed monthly. Marginally higher due to compounding but still ~5%


[09-Feb-20 09:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <DLT Novice> Yes i have Heat earning large on staking, KMD on claiming is very easy. Bought into Verus due to the latest talks by the lead dev. Trying to see if i should sell something else to buy more. The staking is nice but the price appreciation also comes as people notice it and ease of buying it happens.


[09-Feb-20 09:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <DLT Novice> Forgot to mention use cases. At some point we need to use these platforms for something in our lives. Speculation, Value and security seem the first. ID security seems to be here.


[09-Feb-20 09:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> Hi folks... So at this point since altsbit was hacked (Allegedly). What is the best exchange to trade verus coin? Graviex?


[09-Feb-20 10:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <keda666> I have Heat too but never stake because i don't even know it can be stake  üòÖ


[09-Feb-20 11:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> @Faketoshi Nokamoto imo atomicdex is the best possible option despite having drawbacks, but it eliminates the problem of a central party being hacked and your coins being carried out of their premises right away. :-)
if you have to use a centralized exchange at all cost, we're listed with graviex and stex too


[09-Feb-20 11:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <DLT Novice> whats the drawback


[09-Feb-20 11:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> it may not be as userfriendly and it's definitely not finished software


[09-Feb-20 11:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but the 'business end' of it works properly, just the GUIs need some more work. it's the one exchange technology where i _THINK_ you may actually say 'your funds may be safu' - history has shown on centralized exchanges, they are __not__. **guaranteed**


[09-Feb-20 11:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> however it allows true p2p trading (even on litemode!)


[09-Feb-20 11:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> me personally, i dont get why so little people use it. but then whine about altsbit and the others and how they're so bad bad bad


[09-Feb-20 11:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> also - that in my opinion is not a draw back - it shifts responsibility of your coins back to your own


[09-Feb-20 11:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> which is where it should've never been taken away from in the first place.


[09-Feb-20 11:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> which it _HAS_ been taken away from (much more given away without a fight by the user) because everybody uses centralized exchanges.


[09-Feb-20 11:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> n.b. thats my personal opinion above, just so nobody thinks i am speaking on behalf of the veruscoin foundation or team here. but don't use centralized exchanges.


[10-Feb-20 01:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <JC> Hello is it still safe to use v0.57.-4


[10-Feb-20 01:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> It is safe to use it (although it is an outdated Agama version), but development on Agama has stopped.


[10-Feb-20 01:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <JC> Ok thanks


[10-Feb-20 01:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> if you want to use it for verus, you'll have a hard time tho


[10-Feb-20 01:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> if you want to participate the current verus mainnet, you'll need something above 0.6


[10-Feb-20 01:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> for the other coins (and for litemode) it may still be good to go


[10-Feb-20 01:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <JC> I want to use it now for pirate, is that ok?


[10-Feb-20 01:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i honestly don't know, i recommend getting the latest available release of agama


[10-Feb-20 01:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> I'm using it for Pirate....


[10-Feb-20 01:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> ok


[10-Feb-20 01:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <JC> Thank u guys


[10-Feb-20 01:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> if oink says he uses this version for pirate successfully it works


[10-Feb-20 01:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> But I agree with 0x03's recommendation


[10-Feb-20 01:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> but wether it's a good idea or not - i'd definitely update to latest agama.


[10-Feb-20 01:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <JC> Latest version can be used for all coins right?


[10-Feb-20 01:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> all that are included üòâ


[10-Feb-20 01:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <JC> Ok great


[10-Feb-20 01:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> You'll need to download from our github, Agama is no longer listed on our website

[dscrdvrsc] <WarPath> I'm trying to test @safetrade, but my deposit takes to  long to be credited. have you experience it also??


[10-Feb-20 02:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <JC> I had it already installed (v0.5.7.4), still trying to activate best chain on pirate, is that normal?


[10-Feb-20 02:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <JC> 1 hour in


[10-Feb-20 02:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Upgrade to the latest version. iirc that version is pre-komodo fork (Dec 22)


[10-Feb-20 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <JC> Ok let me try with that


[10-Feb-20 03:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <JC> The logo is different right in the new version?


[10-Feb-20 03:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <JC> I downloaded from veruscoin.io


[10-Feb-20 03:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Yes, it is different...


[10-Feb-20 03:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <JC> Great wallet btw


[10-Feb-20 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <DLT Novice> The atomic dex positioned within the new desktop wallet for verus would be a huge win.


[10-Feb-20 03:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <DLT Novice> Even a buy now or sell now. No need to get complicated buy at current prices or sell at current prices


[10-Feb-20 03:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <JC> After altsbit hack, its a must


[10-Feb-20 03:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <JC> Or another exchange


[10-Feb-20 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <DLT Novice> have access to a centralized exchange but only buy now sell now, gets off the exchange in an automated fashion.


[10-Feb-20 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <DLT Novice> But with the features of Komodo and the DEX work that is the way


[10-Feb-20 03:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> does activate for me effortlessly


[10-Feb-20 03:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i suggest checking your DNS server responses, as i usually do üòê


[10-Feb-20 03:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> tried both verus mobile and atomicdex, both do show what they're supposed to


[10-Feb-20 03:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> for starters, simply retrying may just help, maybe restarting the app and/or the phone in the process


[10-Feb-20 04:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <JC> How long does activating best chain last? With new wallet ? Im 1 hour in again


[10-Feb-20 04:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <JC> Is it downloading all blockchain ? (Native activation)


[10-Feb-20 04:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <JC> For pirate


[10-Feb-20 04:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> It should be downloading from the point you shut down. You may be on a fork, since the older version doesn't recognize the correct blocks after the KMD hardfork of December 22nd. In that case I recommend either:
1) invalidating the block that prevents synchronization (Time consuming and requires a bit of knowledge)
2) or download and install the Pirate Bootstrap (Significant download, but easy to perform)


[10-Feb-20 04:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <JC> Im on the last vrsc wallet


[10-Feb-20 04:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <JC> V0.6.4-beta-1


[10-Feb-20 04:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <JC> How can i understand if its stuck or not?


[10-Feb-20 04:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Your previous wallet was Agama 0.5.7-4? That wallet forked. The blockchain data on your hard drive has not been altered during the upgrade to Verus Desktop


[10-Feb-20 04:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <vladimir2019> Good evening all


[10-Feb-20 04:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <JC> Yes prev wallet 0574


[10-Feb-20 04:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <JC> So tbc data is corrupt now you mean?


[10-Feb-20 04:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> OK, then simply install trhe pirate bootstrap. That should get you going

[dscrdvrsc] <rptr> nice exit scam


[10-Feb-20 04:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> technically people gave up control over their coins with each of their deposits. of course, an exchange being hacked is not something you expect or hope for, but ... well


[10-Feb-20 04:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> üôÇ


[10-Feb-20 04:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> also, given how much of a support DP (which then became altsbit) was to a lot of smaller coins and komodo asset chains was, i would be surprised if they turned sides. not impossible, but ... well.


[10-Feb-20 04:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> after all it used to be our only trading place for a while, and they've been helpful and nice.


[10-Feb-20 04:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> if only people remembered 'not your keys, not your coins' more often and acted up to it, the amounts of lossage would be a lot smaller.


[10-Feb-20 04:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> deposit, trade, withdraw, bam. still a small risk of losing some coins, but the risk is a lot more manageable like this.


[10-Feb-20 04:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> what altsbit should remind everybody of: 
- make sure you don't re-use your passwords in more than one place, website, etc
- use **offline** password managers (KeePassX comes to mind as a very good example on all major OS)
- enable and use 2fa wherever possible
- remember: `not your keys, not your coins`, keep as little coins as possible  on centralized exchanges for as short as possible


[10-Feb-20 04:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> (a bit of personal opinion: if anything that is not a specialized staking pool operation tries to incentivize leaving your coins with them, i would understand that alone as a major red flag)


[10-Feb-20 06:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> I won't speculate on the cause of the altsbit hack, but with the volume they have had since the rebrand it was inevitable they would close up shop sooner than later. You can't keep a business open on a few dollars a day revenue, and they showed no interest in doing anything to turn that around.


[10-Feb-20 06:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Patrick Crypto> If we take a wider view, they made too many amateur mistakes. The SSL expiring, the Komodo wallet hack, now this hack.


[10-Feb-20 06:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> i kind of have to acknowledge that tho


[10-Feb-20 06:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hobbit6> Curious, does anyone else whom lost funds on Altsbit exit/hack have transactions that would lead to this particular wallet?  
https://explorer.veruscoin.io/address/RDsPEwJHyPGwW6fXxiZc1E7PAFVWCQDSkS


[10-Feb-20 07:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <MrBizzy> How if it only displays 1 transaction??


[10-Feb-20 07:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <MrBizzy> I thought and called this an exit scam myself, but now it is confusing. Why return some funds if you can take all when you already have decided to close shop and noone knows you anyways..?


[10-Feb-20 07:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <WarPath> is safetrade already accepting deposit of vrsc??


[10-Feb-20 07:52 AM] Gateway#3763

[10-Feb-20 07:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <MoneyBadger> Is there any reliable source of Verus volume across available exchanges?


[10-Feb-20 07:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> I notified CoinPaprika and Coingecko of Verus being listed on Kuang and SafeTrade, but the info has not been processed yet.


[10-Feb-20 08:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <BigCat45> SafeTrade works good. I have deposited, traded and withdrew VRSC from there. @MrBizzy In the hopes no one will be going after them. Legally. Sort of, they did all they could, what else do people want from them?


[10-Feb-20 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Bbkoopsta> well i wanted to trade it too but apparently i can't access my account on Safe.Trade !


[10-Feb-20 09:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <austone> I've been able to deposit, trade, and withdraw without a problem on safetrade as well. @MoneyBadger there'

[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I have 48 VRSC that were inadvertently send to a previously locked address...  need to unlock them.  Anyone know an easy way to do that?


[10-Feb-20 10:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @jimboscott is the address now unlocked?


[10-Feb-20 10:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> It unlocked a while back, yes.


[10-Feb-20 10:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> @miketout


[10-Feb-20 10:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> I accidentally sent a couple of staked blocks to it instead of an R address...


[10-Feb-20 10:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> So, it was a previously locked address to be more specific, but sending the coins to it put them in limbo


[10-Feb-20 10:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> You can spend from it using createrawtransaction as long as you specify nLocktime as a recent block number. I can‚Äôt help in dm now, but I can ping you a bit later.


[10-Feb-20 10:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> That would be great.  If you could sort of show me the proper syntax that would be great.  Can this be done inside the Agama wallet?


[10-Feb-20 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Please move to #community-support for general help on it though. No. From CLI, which is easier on Desktop anyhow.


[10-Feb-20 10:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> OK - just need the syntax.  I am not too good at deciphering createrawtransaction [{"txid":"id","vout":n},...] {"address":amount,...} ( locktime ) ( expiryheight )


[10-Feb-20 11:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - Monkins> @Crypto Rich So the solution that hardware wallet company has that binance are investing in just wipes the wallet if I detects a malicious attack?


[10-Feb-20 11:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - Monkins> I guess you have to go back to your safe and get your private keys out and put them back on?

[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Is there a way to attach agama GUI to a daemon already running?


[10-Feb-20 11:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Aka start verusd via command line, and then open agama and have it display the coin stats page as usual?


[10-Feb-20 11:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> When the daemon crashes every now and then, I‚Äôll relaunch it via cli and agama has no problem resuming operation


[10-Feb-20 11:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Disable ``Stop native daemons on app quit``


[10-Feb-20 11:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> **Settings**
App Config (config.json)
  Native mode
    Stop native daemons on app quit

Remember to scroll down and save.


[10-Feb-20 11:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Next time you start Agama it will pick up already running daemon instead of trying to start new instances.

[dscrdvrsc] <hobbit6> > I thought and called this an exit scam myself, but now it is confusing. Why return some funds if you can take all when you already have decided to close shop and noone knows you anyways..?
@MrBizzy, follow the transactions and they are all combined to a few addresses.  My transaction to Altsbit landed me here.


[10-Feb-20 11:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <hobbit6> Unfortunately I lost over 2500 VRSC


[10-Feb-20 12:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Anyone know what listaccounts returns on the cli?


[10-Feb-20 12:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Appears to be a coin count, but it‚Äôs about 11% higher than the getwalletinfo coin count return


[10-Feb-20 12:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <firebird> wow so cool altsbit hack


[10-Feb-20 12:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> ```Examples:
List account balances where there at least 1 confirmation
> verus listaccounts
List account balances including zero confirmation transactions
> verus listaccounts 0
List account balances for 6 or more confirmations
> verus listaccounts 6```
Not sure why it shows a higher balance than my total.

[10-Feb-20 09:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> Also can i stake and mine with the wallet and is it worth it

[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> simultaneously?


[11-Feb-20 12:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Zack007> Yeah you can , you strake only what you got, and mining uses your CPU so it doesn't affect one the other, as someone mentioned before you need 30k or more so you can probably stake one block a day. Also you can simulate the amount and it gives you the answer. And with the latest Desktop wallet i see it updates your stake to max you hold after a while.

[11-Feb-20 01:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> 0.5.7-4 was released back in july 2019 and isn't able to synchronize past block 800200 (Dec 15, 2019) on Verus, so chances are that you are on a fork. It is advisable to download and install the bootstrap to solve / prevent your wallet ending up on a fork.


[11-Feb-20 01:17 AM] Gateway#3763

[11-Feb-20 01:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Check the blockheight against the blockheight the explorer shows. They should match (or be very close)


[11-Feb-20 01:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> @funfarooq Here are some words from Mike about IDs:
Probably the first and easiest thing to understand is that instead of a public key hash as your blockchain address, IDs give you a global friendly name that can be setup with a backup ID able to revoke and recover all funds sent to the ID and restore the identity, any ability to prove something using it, and all funds back to your own ownership under different keys. IDs are also quantum ready, and outputs sent to IDs can be retroactively protected without a resend with quantum-secure signatures when they are available on the network.
In addition, IDs have private address endpoints that can be used for sending funds, messages, voting, or other applications that require some level of privacy.
They have the ability to establish claims and attestations that can be used to validate various aspects of a user.
They have enough information proving capability to serve as the root of a self-sovereign social network profile.
They will enable you to start a blockchain on the Verus network with the same name, among other types of services. Blockchains can also mint their own IDs, which will have the form name.blockchain@ for various purposes.
Identities can represent people, companies, real world assets or contracts, or products in a supply chain.
They are transferable, editable and can be changed at any time from unisig to multisig, and enable a new level of security by being the first type of decentralized blockchain address that can support hardware which never gives up its key, even for backup, pointing the way to self-sovereign quantum secure authentication and authorization for everything from blockchain to normal web services to physical things like homes, cars, and safes.

[dscrdvrsc] <JC> Ok no big deal


[11-Feb-20 01:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <JC> Had very tiny amount on altsbit


[11-Feb-20 01:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> The hardfork (intended fork) was at block 800200. Forks happen on the network but the daemon normally detects it being on a fork and switches back to the main chain, unless the fork happened more than 100 blocks earlier. usually people don't notice forks unless an unusual amount of nodes are on it.


[11-Feb-20 01:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <JC> Ok i will wait till 800200 then, if it passes that number i should be ok i guess


[11-Feb-20 01:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> @funfarooq That is up to you to decide. My thinking is that everybody should have a VerusID (well actually probably at least 3), and the sooner people start using them the better. Inventing the wheel has no impact if nobody starts using it.


[11-Feb-20 01:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <funfarooq> @Cragorn where to buy it


[11-Feb-20 01:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <funfarooq> How much it cost


[11-Feb-20 01:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> We can already sign and verify files and messages with them right now. Soon we can start PBaaS blockchains with them, and develop basically anything you can think of.
You need to get the Verus Desktop wallet, download and sync up the chain (best by bootstrap), and then you will need 80.0001 VRSC in the wallet to be able to commit a name for an ID, and then buy it with those coins.


[11-Feb-20 01:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> An ID cost 100 VRSC, but you get 20 VRSC dicount if you put in a referral ID, like "Verus Coin Foundation@".


[11-Feb-20 01:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <funfarooq> That seems to be informative


[11-Feb-20 01:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> When commiting a name for an ID you will also pay one transaction fee, which is 0.0001 VRSC, so that is why you actually need 80.0001 VRSC


[11-Feb-20 01:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <funfarooq> So is there option in wallet it self to do it . Creating verus is and sending amount


[11-Feb-20 01:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <funfarooq> By doing it I will have my name instead of public address where people can pay me back .


[11-Feb-20 01:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> You can either mine Verus with your CPU from the wallet, or you can buy from an exchange.


[11-Feb-20 01:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <funfarooq> I have verus


[11-Feb-20 01:37 AM] Gateway#3763

[11-Feb-20 01:37 AM] Gateway#3763

[11-Feb-20 01:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> Yes, people can send VRSC to Cragorn@ instead of Rasdfawer97qrpaw34qy23ry2034sfaw3rjhp0aw3r something üôÇ

[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> Right now there are just a few, like friendly name sending of coins and messages, but soon PBaaS will come to mainnet and that is when the real interesting stuff will start to happen imo.


[11-Feb-20 01:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <funfarooq> Pbaas stands for ?


[11-Feb-20 01:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> Let me check that address, so that it goes to the foundation for support...


[11-Feb-20 01:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> Public Blockchain as a Service


[11-Feb-20 01:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Zack007> i guess it's redistributed as reward for all


[11-Feb-20 01:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Zack007> or ?


[11-Feb-20 01:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> Meaning it si a decentralized blockchain supported by the miners and stakers of the Verus blockchain through Merge Mining


[11-Feb-20 01:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> The most common friendly name ID for the Foundation is "Verus Coin Foundation@"


[11-Feb-20 01:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> so use that if you want to support the foundation and help realize the Verus Vision


[11-Feb-20 01:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <funfarooq> and when it is offered as service then verus miners can mine them and get new rewards


[11-Feb-20 01:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> If miners and stakers choose to merge mine your PBaaS chain it will be because you make it worth their effort throug rewards


[11-Feb-20 01:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> Like transaction fees and other things


[11-Feb-20 01:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> Maybe you let people buy IDs on you subchain, and that should cost something so that miners get rewarded for verifying the transactions


[11-Feb-20 01:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> On the question: `80 verus will go to development team?`:
20 VRSC wil go to the refferer, 20 VRSC will go to the referrers referrer (if any), 20 VRSC will go to the referrers referrers referrer (if any), what remains is included in the block that is mined/staked as a reward on top of the coinbase reward of (currently) 24 VRSC.


[11-Feb-20 01:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Zack007> so any ID can be used as referral ?


[11-Feb-20 01:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Any existing ID can be used, but in Verus Discord itself we only post `Verus Coin Foundation@` to support the foundation in its work. It's an idealistic approach where we rather have the foundation be able to continue developing over personal short-term gains.


[11-Feb-20 01:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Zack007> Good to know


[11-Feb-20 01:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <funfarooq> yes very informative now


[11-Feb-20 02:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> Maybe you are a travel company selling airplane tickets or something. You let people create an account and get an ID on your chain (or just use their Verus ID), and give them a discount on tickets bought with your system, and reward them with some sort of bonus for sticking to your company. And you can also let them earn coins or travel points from contributing to the chain by mining and/or staking. Just a simple example. Also, your ID could be used as identification and ticket at the airport checkin and at the gate. So in future you might not have to bring a passport or other type of physical ID since your Verus ID could have replaced those. @funfarooq


[11-Feb-20 02:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> There is no guarantee this will become reality, but I believe Verus is the best protocol available and the one that has all the tools aligned and ready to make this happen.


[11-Feb-20 02:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <funfarooq> thats lots of stuff . will block chain will reach that point. out of exisiting so many coins and algorithams ans blocks why people will choose verus.


[11-Feb-20 02:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <funfarooq> may be you developers have lots of work . lots of marketing


[11-Feb-20 02:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> Yea, but this is just one simple example. There are so many oportunities here.


[11-Feb-20 02:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <funfarooq> like health records, property records, same as wheel its not just for spinning . it can be used in many ways


[11-Feb-20 02:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> Devs spend their time on development, not marketing. That is one of the reasons we have all this tech already.


[11-Feb-20 02:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <DLT Novice> maybe target bars and clubs first hehe get the just of age marketing and using it.


[11-Feb-20 02:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <funfarooq> making pots using wheel too . and making vehicle gears even in jucie machine


[11-Feb-20 02:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> Health records is a big thing....


[11-Feb-20 02:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <DLT Novice> very true iota is tageting ID in health


[11-Feb-20 02:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> Perfect example of using ID to verify age without giving up all your personal info


[11-Feb-20 02:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <funfarooq> how the system verify that ID is me  . i mean i can pay 100 verus and create multiple ID one for going school one for going to bar


[11-Feb-20 02:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> We need a trusted party to verify your ID by signing it with their ID.


[11-Feb-20 02:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> Like a government entity like a police department or similar, a bank maybe.


[11-Feb-20 02:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <funfarooq> and trusted party can mischief . there must be checks over checks like block chian it self . finally the data is reliable


[11-Feb-20 02:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> Somebody that can look at you physical ID and check that it is you that own the Verus ID, and then sign it to confirm that your ID is identifying you.


[11-Feb-20 02:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <funfarooq> okay you can say like india we have something called aadhar card it has unique number for a person. that way you can contorl a person buying multiple ids


[11-Feb-20 02:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <funfarooq> and again the verification guy should get some verus coin. or else why he will do the verification. and if verification is done one guy. it must be confirmed by miners like that block chain to make it authentic. one verification wont make data accurate


[11-Feb-20 02:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> You can have multiple VerusIDs, for specific purposes. You could create an ID for Gaming, one for social Media, one for official use etc... They don't need to contain the same information or the same level of trust for different purposes.


[11-Feb-20 02:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Zack007> yeah i'd take one for BAR üòÑ


[11-Feb-20 02:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> However, you could put that all into 1 ID without implications. You decide what info you share.


[11-Feb-20 02:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <funfarooq> as example mentioned above verifying bar . young guy will make two ids with different age one for school one for bar


[11-Feb-20 02:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Who's going to attest that the forged age is actual? And is that entity trustworthy?


[11-Feb-20 02:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <funfarooq> same guy who say real age is actual. may be a different verifier


[11-Feb-20 02:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> If a trustworthy entity (like a government organization) attests that the age is checked and accurate, that has more reliability than if some random friend states that.


[11-Feb-20 02:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> "trustworthy" 
"government organization"


[11-Feb-20 02:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <funfarooq> lolz government organization lolz


[11-Feb-20 02:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <funfarooq> i understood. but stil single entity . and it wont be decentralized


[11-Feb-20 02:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <funfarooq> again it will be centralized


[11-Feb-20 02:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <funfarooq> still it will be intresting to see how you guys will design the system and tackle this problem


[11-Feb-20 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> Any way you look at it, done right an ID like this will be a lot more difficult to fake, and with the revocation and recovery it will be less of a problem with stolen identities in the future. If an ID gets stolen it can be rendered useless and then taken back by the owner.


[11-Feb-20 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <funfarooq> once i have said about this to one of my friend . he was like is it even possible. and your saying the tech is here


[11-Feb-20 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> If you live in a place where the government is corrupt and can't be considered trustworthy, then the person or entity that needs to decide if your ID is true and correct have to consider the source that signed your ID. If I work at the door of a bar and ask to see your ID, and it has a picture of you and says you are 21 years old, that seems ok, but I have to check who attested/signed on this, and if the only ID that signed it is yomama@, then I might not want to take it for granted that it is true üôÇ


[11-Feb-20 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <funfarooq> and different bars will have different meassures. then bars have to put up a sign saying id signed by govt officer/your mayour/your mom/your doctor is only valid


[11-Feb-20 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> The tech is actually here, but most people are so used to hear about visions an future plans, so when we try to get people to consider this already being available it is difficult to get through and get past the "nah, you are just hypeword spamming me..." üòÇ


[11-Feb-20 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <funfarooq> i am glad atleast i am here now with block chain. from a month learning more about it


[11-Feb-20 02:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> LIke that bar example, you might just hold up your phone showing a QR-code of your ID, and when the doorman scans it his app will have preconfigured what requirements are asked for to approve, so maybe they accept verified by bank A and B, and also the goverment official entity that makes passports. Just an example. If none of those have signed your ID then you shall not enter.


[11-Feb-20 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <funfarooq> i guess it will make life lot more easy


[11-Feb-20 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <funfarooq> and sharing what we what we want to share . not our phone number. bar guys sending promotional sms


[11-Feb-20 02:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> If you have been at that bar before, like a year ago before this doorman started working there, and you maybe started a fight and got banned because you put a guy in hospital, then that might not show up when he scans your ID, but it says that you are not alowed to enter. So he does not get to know everything bad you did in the past, but he gets to know only what he needs to know, that he can't let you in. So less intrusion on your info, and at the same time he can do his job better to keep the other guests safe.


[11-Feb-20 02:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Zack007> the doorman will be out of a job being replaced with a scanner on the wall that will open the electric lock to the bar , and after that only a matter of time when robot arms will be pouring you shots


[11-Feb-20 02:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> hahaha maybe


[11-Feb-20 02:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> they will be faster, more accurate and hygenic too üòõ


[11-Feb-20 02:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <funfarooq> very true


[11-Feb-20 02:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <funfarooq> any way alcohol and bars are considered as for those who are drug addicts here. alcohol  is not day to day product though. we have restaurents . but they wont server THE A word


[11-Feb-20 02:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> And if you prefer to, they will give you your favourite beverage when you show your face at the bar based on previous activity


[11-Feb-20 02:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Zack007> there was a bar in Hamburg Germany last summer and there was a silly sign, pay with btc for one drink , actually it was beer only and if the confirmation took long enough you could drink 2-3 depending


[11-Feb-20 02:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <funfarooq> ohooo favourite beverages .


[11-Feb-20 02:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <funfarooq> thats called using tech in right way


[11-Feb-20 02:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> haha, btc will probably never  be good for small transactions that need to happen in 1-2 seconds


[11-Feb-20 02:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Zack007> maybe if they keep forking it lightning fast they get there üòâ


[11-Feb-20 02:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <funfarooq> like guy waiting at the bar holding his qr code. block to be mined and confirmed in btc


[11-Feb-20 02:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <funfarooq> forking ? is it not copying the code from github or making a copy of it in your github account and using it or modifying it. restuarent has to develop their own system with verus code and add favourite beverage


[11-Feb-20 02:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> But for a more current example, right now you can sign and verify files with your ID. So say you want to send a friend some Zip-file or other document, but you both have fear of opening such files because of virus and trojans. You can sign the zip-file with your ID, and he can check the file he receives before he opens it, to get confirmation it was truly signed by you, and that it has not been tampered with on the way to him.


[11-Feb-20 02:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Zack007> was a joke for the lightning network adding additional layer for faster payment with btc


[11-Feb-20 02:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> A resturant could make their own PBaaS chain to do this, or better yet, a company could create it and let unlimited number of restaurants join and use the system and set their own details on it.


[11-Feb-20 02:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Zack007> would work for food delivery as well


[11-Feb-20 02:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> yes


[11-Feb-20 02:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <funfarooq> applications are never ending. so have to start making app for restaurents


[11-Feb-20 02:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> The way I see it, any action that requires transfer of currency or identity information can be made better and safer with the right PBaaS chain on Verus. And a bonus is that it will protect your privacy and data if you want it to.


[11-Feb-20 03:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> We are working on awareness in general, and since this is a community effort we rely on everyone in the community to take part in this, but I believe that right now the most important part of marketing is to make developers aware of our tech and have them understand that they can start building the next big app. Everyone here can help by supporting when there is a new tweet out, or article or video. Like, comment, retweet. Everything helps, and if people in discord contributes just a tiny bit each it will have massive effect on our efforts going forward. üòÑ üëç


[11-Feb-20 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SecretRecipe> any idea why dino bot messaged me


[11-Feb-20 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <SecretRecipe> lol


[11-Feb-20 09:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Zack007> probably wanted the secret recipe ?


[11-Feb-20 10:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <anrahu akeba> After thinking about it, isn't the next step in PBaaS to be the recently popular defi? If the performance bottleneck is resolved, other projects will cooperate with verus. The scale effect of Ethereum is much larger. There are thousands of DEFI-related projects on it. What is the cost of migration?


[11-Feb-20 10:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <anrahu akeba> excited


[11-Feb-20 11:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Fukblm> hey guys for pirate how do i load my private key on the new verus wallet ?


[11-Feb-20 11:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Try asking your question in one channel.


[11-Feb-20 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto278> Isn't there a meeting today? No one in chat.

[dscrdvrsc] <Zack007> the samsung launch just ended probably they are still in shock :))


[11-Feb-20 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto278> @Zack007 what did samsung announce?


[11-Feb-20 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Zack007> the new Galaxy S20 models starting at $1000, all 5G , 8K cam , some AI , ear pods+ for $150 with 2 speakers better bass, samsung netflix partnership, the usual


[11-Feb-20 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto278> Nice


[11-Feb-20 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Fukblm Verus Desktop supports Pirate in native mode. If your wallet.dat is in the correct folder, it should work. For importing keys into a wallet, you should use the ```run z_importkey``` or even ```run z_importviewingkey``` commands from the setting->coin settings console.


[11-Feb-20 03:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <DLT Novice> To own ARRR in the new dsktop wallet - i would have to start in native mode and then get an address and then send ARRR to it. But i do not want to run it as a node. Is there a way to just add to the wallet and have it safely there but not have to download the entire chain?


[11-Feb-20 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <allbits> You can use a paper wallet for your arr if you don't want to download a chain.  Or the pirate lite wallet. See pirate.black or the pirate discord for more information.


[11-Feb-20 06:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <JT> I've been pretty out of the loop for a couple weeks.. A) is verus desktop now the preferred wallet (ie, out of alpha test?) and B) is there a page somewhere that says 'here is how to move from agama to verus desktop and keep your existing wallets?')


[11-Feb-20 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> Agama is being depreciated. All you need to do is stop it, download the new wallet and run it.


[11-Feb-20 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <DLT Novice> Really once you have a KMD VERUS address then Pirate should be the same send to address. Thats the advantage of the KMD ecosystem. I know there is a lite version. Any chance of the lite version as an addition to the current Verus Desktop?


[11-Feb-20 08:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <DLT Novice> I sent 1000kmd but it sent 997kmd - so there is a fee of what percent? Should it have sent the 1000 and added the charge?


[11-Feb-20 08:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Best to ask any Verus related (or KMD in this case) questions in #community-support or the relevant #gui-wallet/#cli-wallet channel but it should show the fee before you send and pretty sure you can choose to include the it yourself (or increase it) but it's usually automatic if you don't.  @DLT Novice. ‚úåÔ∏è

[dscrdvrsc] <vogelfreund88> I must say safetrade is one of the worst exchanges i have seen in the last years... only 404 Pages, there Must be Profis üòâ be careful!!!


[12-Feb-20 04:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <DCAL4> @vogelfreund88 in the midst of a massive upgrade that required several restarts. Will run smoothly soon. Stay tuned for announcements soon


[12-Feb-20 06:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <anrahu akeba> I think the important issue now is that there is no exchange that every member is satisfied with. I admit that many people in the community have made a lot of contributions. I am not here to complain, but there are still some community holders, miners, Traders, I think they need a practical, not so well-known but useful exchange. Does anyone have any good ideas?


[12-Feb-20 06:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <anrahu akeba> or some good newsÔºü


[12-Feb-20 06:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> @anrahu akeba you can also apply for listings and comment on exchanges twitter/telegram questions to ask about listing


[12-Feb-20 06:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> personally I was doing so - also applied to tradeogre exchange this week (again I think) but the more people makes such activity the more visible your favourite crypto project is


[12-Feb-20 06:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <anrahu akeba> Yes, but as far as I know, only a few people make a list request on twitter or elsewhere. We need more help. Now I think it is an obvious mistake for everyone not to support landing on CITEX .Mike was right, but we Did not give him enough support


[12-Feb-20 07:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @anrahu akeba, I don't think @passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã was referring to just making lists. There are lots of things we can do on our own right now- I've seen some of his own personal Tweets reaching out to other exchanges and I've made a few myself, along with many others here, but every little bit helps (especially recognition). Everyone wants things to get done, but in a community project that requires *real* participation. 
Citex is a good example actually- they may seem obvious now that altsbit is gone and we could use them but at the time very few got behind it.
Like that Gandhi (mis)quote: be the change that you'd like to see in the world üôÇ


[12-Feb-20 07:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Also, is Citex *off the table* or did we just not gain traction at the time? If it is still an option, glad you brought it up @anrahu akeba, maybe it is worth revisiting now considering things have changed somewhat? They are another cmc exchange and they seemed to have good volume and supposedly a larger presence with the asian communities


[12-Feb-20 07:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <anrahu akeba> yeahÔºåI did the thing similarÔºåI translated Mike's video to the Chinese community a few days ago, but I believe we can do more.

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Oh that's awesome @anrahu akeba- that's very helpful and good for additional exposure. Thanks for doing it.üëç  I agree with you though- we can do more.
Fortunately, we have a fairly large community now with a wide range of skill sets thats growing by the day. Tapping into only a fraction of that potential is an invaluable asset that almost no other project or company can have direct access to like we do now. The importance of each individual contribution can not be overstated.

[12-Feb-20 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> i just got OTC swaps working with PIRATE. it will require running full nodes (bob) by community members. the alice nodes are the user who will need to trust the bob node with some small amount, 10 to 100 ARR. but these are known members who are bobs so we can have an insurance fund to cover any losses (which i dont expect we will have any).

the basic idea is to trade $100 worth, you can do 100x $1 trades, and only be at risk $1 at the most
by having it fully automated, it can be a mostly set it and forget it thing for the bob nodes, just need to monitor inventory levels
and also limit max exposure if there are a lot of non-notarized swaps pending


[12-Feb-20 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> VRSC should also work with the subatomic swaps and even better it can be made to work with the micropayments that i will be adding, just thought it would be a good thing for community bob nodes that provide some inventory and a way for people to swap VRSC in realtime


[12-Feb-20 09:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> @jl777c sounds cool , but it's not atomic, more like escrow with backup/insurance funds ?


[12-Feb-20 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> its not atomic, but you can reduce the amount at risk to less than 1%


[12-Feb-20 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> and if the bob node you are swapping with is 0x03 node, then really, there shouldnt be much worry about $1 amounts


[12-Feb-20 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> I was thinking about such solution possibility - to have "liquidity providers with sinsurance funds" how you call it


[12-Feb-20 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> is it in a way decentralized that anyone could become liquidity provider with insurance input ?


[12-Feb-20 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> so it isnt strictly atomic, but from a practical standpoint it is very low risk and as you said the bobs could put up a deposit to cover insurance payouts


[12-Feb-20 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> and get a 1% ?


[12-Feb-20 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> as reward


[12-Feb-20 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> the 1% is if the bob steals it


[12-Feb-20 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> yes I got it, just shifting topic a bit üôÇ


[12-Feb-20 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> each bob node would need to be a marketmaker, so they would make money on the bid/ask spread


[12-Feb-20 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> to motivate more people participate as bobs, but with a condition to insert insurance fund that cover single time value / make it in a way decentralized social p2p and so on


[12-Feb-20 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> for example I could put 100Arrr as my insurance (smart contract) that would mean at a single tx someone can exchange 100 Arrr to anything he wants, if I steal it - smart contract steals my insurance or sth like that


[12-Feb-20 09:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> the deposits/insurance would need to be a manual process. we need to pick reliable bobs, not just anybody off the street with a few dollars of deposit


[12-Feb-20 09:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> that smart contract locked amount could be actually done in the other transparent currency, as smart contracts probably easier for transparent coins


[12-Feb-20 09:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> if "anybody of the street" would put some money on multikey addr that could be spent if he cheats ?


[12-Feb-20 09:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> and 1 single swap of his amount would be possible at a time ? should be fine ?


[12-Feb-20 09:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <jl777c> yes, that could make it so nobody would bother to cheat


[12-Feb-20 09:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> and if someone wanted to sell 1000 and put 100 in insurance that would mean this will go in sequence of 10 tx 100 each so that each tx after tx would be secure

[12-Feb-20 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> We will have some new and leading privacy tech in the very near future, but to not be included in its announce means it's likely a marketing alliance, not an effort to push the envelope, and that Verus is also likely not to benefit by being part of it after the fact.

[13-Feb-20 12:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> You should probably not run both wallets at the same time. But I had similar problem first time I ran the new Verus Desktop. Simple solution if the daemon doesn't load automaticly is just navigate down in the folders to it and start it manually the first time. After that it will start automatically each time you restart the wallet.


[13-Feb-20 12:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Or detach the apps from closing down the daemon when exiting one of them.

[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> @Franckimp i have a copy of my main wallet.dat around that makes me a billionaire ü§£ that has to do with the data structure in the wallet


[13-Feb-20 03:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> it would be fixed by making sure you're neither on a fork (thus on the correct chain) nor having corrupted data on disk (i.e. performing a chain rescan or reindex)


[13-Feb-20 03:03 AM] Gateway#3763

[13-Feb-20 03:05 AM] Gateway#3763

[13-Feb-20 03:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> that happens, and rescanning/reindexing (after making sure you're on the right chain to start with) will do you good, promised.

Hey so with the verus wallet, Ive noticed some functions on linux do not work. The claiming functionality is completely obsolete from the gui. I wasnt sure where to report the bug


[13-Feb-20 07:31 AM] frosty112#9240
Then also, signatures should not be contained in the package file. If an attacker was to modify said wallet, they could simply rehash. The signatures are literally worthless in the current usecase


[13-Feb-20 07:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> They would need to have controll of the ID that signed it if they want to modify and create a new hash with that ID, and as long as the foundation sticks to the pratice of using this ID for everything so it is common knowledge that this is the one to trust, it should be good. Correct me if I am wrong. At least this was my impression.


[13-Feb-20 07:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03> unless you have access to the ID the whole result wont compute

[dscrdvrsc] <SHossain> @miketout @michaeltoutjr @oink#3612 the first KMD <> VRSC subatomic swap completed successfully! It's for small amounts and needs native mode for now. Here is the guide on how to do it and proof of the swap including txids.

[dscrdvrsc] <SHossain> @0x03 it's still using the mighty `dexp2p` tech for atomicDEX orderbook he started working over a month ago. that allows live-streaming, file sharing, private message, notarizer and now the subatomic swaps. so, OTC trades/swaps will be easy

[dscrdvrsc] <DCAL4> Every time I get to thinking about how VRSC will provide liquidity as reserve currency to every chain in the Verus ecosystem I can‚Äôt help but think we are holding on to what may be one of the most valuable assets. Can‚Äôt wait for PBAAS.

[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto278> @DCAL4 what price range you thinking?


[14-Feb-20 10:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <DCAL4> Not sure, I can dream big but it all depends on what is created in the ecosystem. If PBAAS takes off and we see really great innovation not just from the main VRSC devs but also projects starting chains on Verus it will shock a lot of people...well, the ones that are not paying attention that is.


[14-Feb-20 11:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã last discussion I had with @KOSIUS , he was negotiating an offer for ProBit for both VRSC and ARRR, as I was finishing up VerusID. An official offer came back from ProBit where they were telling us one price for listing and ARRR another lower price, but claiming to us listing prices were the same, at the same time as they told Pirate to accept because they had a better deal. We agreed that due to that dishonesty, ProBit was not an exchange we could endorse for the community. That was late last year, and @KOSIUS said not to worry about how that happened and that he would check on exchanges to list together. I haven't heard from him since. After that and not being included in their new privacy marketing group, I think we may have a different relationship with Pirate than when @FishyGuts ran it. Not that big of an issue, as when PBaaS comes out, I have a plan that will solve liquidity as much or more than listings on all of the top exchanges, and we will bring more privacy in the process to crypto than people expect or believe could happen right now. Right now, we may feel like we are behind on exchanges, but when we have a PBaaS that allows the creation of multi-reserve currencies, which can include external currencies and be bought and sold using any of its reserves at a market rate, it will support more liquidity to many currencies and across the Verus ecosystem than a Binance, Bitttrex, and Kraken listing combined. In addition, all PBaaS currencies will support zero-knowledge transactions, even if they are the native currency of a balanced basket of BTC, ETH, USDT, and VRSC.


[14-Feb-20 11:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> Thx Mike! Sad that relations with other teams are not perfect, but on the other hand if the coming solution is that good then we can wait üôÇ


[14-Feb-20 11:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <DCAL4> That is what keeps crossing my mind on the way PBaaS will work for Verus...it will be the first crypto that literally does not need an exchange.

[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> What's up with safe trade the exchange is horrible. i can't even get my phone texted with an sms so i can deposit.


[14-Feb-20 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto278> @Faketoshi Nokamoto what do you mean. I didnt need a phone text to make a deposit. Are you talking about the intial sign up?


[14-Feb-20 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto278> Nice I see the new logo just got put on discord.


[14-Feb-20 01:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> yes to get verified to make a deposit you need to have them text your phone with a code it doesnt work

[14-Feb-20 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto278> @Faketoshi Nokamoto oh okay I thought you meant just to make a deposit each time. Yes to sign up you need the phone. Go on there discord and ask them for help


[14-Feb-20 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> Question. The new verus  0.0.6.4 wallet is only working when i run agama 6.1. I t says No running VRSC daemon found.


[14-Feb-20 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> @Faketoshi Nokamoto Did you try what I suggested last time you asked? I answered that same issue last thursday in #gui-wallet  üòâ  I even linked to a longer explanation I wrote January 27th.


[14-Feb-20 04:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> @Cragorn there is nothing for Thursday in gui wallet. What is your solution please repeat


[14-Feb-20 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> @Cragorn nm it was actually in genrall chat i see what you said ok let me try that  thanks


[14-Feb-20 04:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> @Cragorn where is the folder located in what directory


[14-Feb-20 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> @Cragorn lol the new wallet is terribad i will just stick with the old one at least the old one actually works


[14-Feb-20 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> @Faketoshi Nokamoto You are right, it was here, and 2 posts down i provided a link to my earlier post where I explain how you can fix it easy, and I tell you how to find the daemon. Here it is again.

[14-Feb-20 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> chain info doesnt say if it loading the whole blockcvhain again so i am not sure what the heck this wallet is doing but i am not uninstalling my agama wallet to use this one  unles i know it is working ok


[14-Feb-20 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> Saying this wallet is ¬´terribad¬ª seems like a cheap shot at the hard working devs that has made an awesome new wallet from the ground up. It‚Äôs still beta, so some minor issues is to be expected. I try to provide a simple fix while we wait for the next version, just being helpfull.
The ¬´verusd.exe¬ª is located in a subfolder of the Verus Desktop folder. Not in the roaming folder.


[14-Feb-20 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> so does verifying blocks means it is downloading the block chain


[14-Feb-20 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> yeah but typing in that doesn not bring up that directory you are speaking of


[14-Feb-20 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> it does show a directory when you first run the wallet


[14-Feb-20 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> ill try that one


[14-Feb-20 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> If it is verifying blocks then the daemon is running. Give it a few minutes to do that. It is scanning through a bunch if data.


[14-Feb-20 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> Learn patience, yeah yeah, how long will that take? üòÇ


[14-Feb-20 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> yeah instead of being  smart ass just verify it is downloading the block in that case i can leave it open and come back in two day  in hopes it will be done


[14-Feb-20 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> simply trying to verify it is actually working as the old wallet let you know with certainty it was actually downloading the block chain


[14-Feb-20 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> the new wallet is bad and doesnt do that


[14-Feb-20 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> I suppose i should wait until the next 2 updates to even bother with this new wallet


[14-Feb-20 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> w/e  no big deal


[14-Feb-20 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> Hey, you didn‚Äôt provide that info until you posted the picture with the text. Sorry for trying to help out. I am done.


[14-Feb-20 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> assuming it scanning  and it will be for a very long time it is dong what it is suposed to do and downloading the entire blockchain  ok later thanks for nothing


[14-Feb-20 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> Thanks for trying @Cragorn


[14-Feb-20 05:08 PM] Gateway#3763

[14-Feb-20 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> Well you being part of the actual team did nothing to help so. Are you saying he is more helpful then a team member


[14-Feb-20 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> All you had to do was answer one quick question and tell my when it says scanning the block chain it is infact downloading it and to leave it alone for a day until it's done that simple


[14-Feb-20 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> Because the old wallet as i said make that very obvious


[14-Feb-20 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> The new does not


[14-Feb-20 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> whatever who cares i will find out eventually


[14-Feb-20 05:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I'm done as well


[14-Feb-20 05:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> @miketout great team member there. Who can i notify of your great insight and help with the new Verus coin wallet.  I will be glad to pass the word on.


[14-Feb-20 05:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> I might as well as well start giving advice on the wallet since you can't. Hahah


[14-Feb-20 05:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> ok. good luck. if you prefer to be banned, one more


[14-Feb-20 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763

[14-Feb-20 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I came online to find you insulting @Cragorn only to have you start insulting me


[14-Feb-20 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> All i was trying to do was get the new wallet working. What i should have said is what you advised to do was not working so well


[14-Feb-20 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> And you never bothered to read the answers with the solution.


[14-Feb-20 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> I did and they did not work


[14-Feb-20 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> you want help, ask. you want to insult people trying to help you, go somewhere else


[14-Feb-20 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> As your directions were very poorly explained and no offense


[14-Feb-20 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763

[14-Feb-20 07:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> Maybe the newer revision might just make it a wee bit easier to clarify that it's syncing the block chain. Other than that the new wallet is actually much better in UI and sleeker looking.


[14-Feb-20 07:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Glad it worked out @Faketoshi Nokamoto

[14-Feb-20 08:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> that doesnt look normal and if i click the transaction id and it go to the explorer it says not found. I can only assume this is do to the privacy features of that address not being able to be traced correct?


[14-Feb-20 08:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> it is the same address that i mine to i know it correct i checked it nothing in my wallet yet though.


[14-Feb-20 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> That is a transparent address. That they don't have a txid probably means the error is on their end or with the account. Their wallet looks like it's fine and in sync. They have this nice wallets page: https://graviex.net/wallets/list

[14-Feb-20 08:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> It must be a transparent address, since you can only mine to a transparent address now.

[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> i mine to my private address with no issue even as we speak

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> ah,


[14-Feb-20 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> hope i dont lose all those fund now


[14-Feb-20 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> you mean from LuckPool or something maybe? i was thinking about the fact that a coinbase can only go to a transparent address


[14-Feb-20 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> yes luck pool


[14-Feb-20 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i guess you probably didn't lose them


[14-Feb-20 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> i think that Graviex only supports transparent addresses


[14-Feb-20 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> so, it probably just failed to send


[14-Feb-20 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> ok well i put in a ticket hopefully I can get it resolved then


[14-Feb-20 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> ok cool thanks'


[14-Feb-20 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> did it take it from your account? it says error. is it possible you can just try again?


[14-Feb-20 08:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> yep its all taken wallet says zero


[14-Feb-20 08:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> well, they do support Pirate, so maybe they are supposed to support Z as well. I'm not sure. Since it says error, I guess they will probably resolve it. When we've worked with them on the network side, they've been quite responsive.


[14-Feb-20 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> Ok i am sure it will turn up only $100


[14-Feb-20 08:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> or close to it


[14-Feb-20 10:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> @miketout They said i sent it to an invalid address and gave me the funds back. So apparently you were correct you can only withdraw to a transparent address not a private address.


[14-Feb-20 10:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Faketoshi Nokamoto> Which i guess makes sense, but my mining is going to my private address. owell least i got my coins back

[dscrdvrsc] <nmnm> thats the zs address  ? stakeguard?


[15-Feb-20 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> stakeguard is a protocol on the Verus network that solves the "nothing at stake" issue with PoS. It is a theoretical PoS attack that can contribute to chain fragmentation by making it in a selfish staker's interest to stake on every fork that their daemon sees, giving a higher chance if one of them wins, but in no way contributing to chain convergence. by entering a stakeguard address, you become a guard for the network by looking for stakes that have provably "cheated" by staking the same coins on two different forks of the chain, which can only happen if you are staking the same coins / private keys on multiple running wallets. with stakeguard, you check all stake transactions, even those that do not make it into the chain, and if you find proof of anyone double-staking, your wallet spends their coinbase reward to your stakeguard address. Many people on the network run stakeguard, so you never know if you will be the one to get the payout if you catch someone, but cheaters never prosper.

For a positive and more productive discussion I suggest that you guys provide some insight into why you have these opinions. Namecalling, swearing, sarcasm and condescending talk is not in the spirit of Verus, in my opinion. It's just too easy to hurt people, and jokes that was not intended to be negative can easily be taken that way.

[dscrdvrsc] <mach11978> Of topic sorta  anyone know who can fix a crashed hdd. All I need is the wallet off of it. Not the whole hdd


[18-Feb-20 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> You only need `%AppData%\Komodo\VRSC\wallet.dat`


[18-Feb-20 12:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> unless you go to a company for hard drive recovery, which has other risks and costs quite a lot whether they succeed or not, this is the best software I know of for possibly helping: https://www.grc.com/cs/prepurch.htm
I used to work with Steve Gibson years ago, and he almost certainly knows more about how to twiddle the low level hardware on disks to get data off of them with software than anyone alive.


[18-Feb-20 12:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> I don't know which software you'd want there, or if there is a free version available to try, so DYOR on that, but the software should do what it says it will.


[18-Feb-20 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <mach11978> Ok that's what I have  I have the wallet. Dat file. Do I need to wait for the chain to complete before I see if it works last time I saved it was in December or being of jan


[18-Feb-20 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> You can use the bootstrap procedure to speed up the synchronization process considerably:

[18-Feb-20 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> But you do need a synchronized chain to have reliable data

[dscrdvrsc] <mach11978> Ok well what I just did is I kept the komdo opened I Uninstalled it now I'm going to put my old. Data file there before it starts.     I'll let you know how it work out thank you

[dscrdvrsc] <Cryptoprenuer> hi guys can my dat files from agama go into the new veruswallet ?


[21-Feb-20 01:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cryptoprenuer> if not where can i down load agama to transfer my coins over


[21-Feb-20 01:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Verus Wallet uses the same locations and files as Agama did, so: yes, your dat files can go into Verus Desktop.


[21-Feb-20 01:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> @Cryptoprenuer Sounds like you might need to step up your backup routine unless you have all keys stored elsewhere.
```
VRSC Wallet location on different OS:
Linux GUI: ~/.komodo/VRSC
Mac OS: /Users//Library/Application Support/komodo/VRSC
Windows 10: %AppData%\Komodo\VRSC\```


[21-Feb-20 01:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cryptoprenuer> @zpajk back ups are fine bro i have my .dats backed up im transfering to a new machine thats all


[21-Feb-20 01:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Sorry, read it again in less of a hurry, and realize I jumped to conclusion. üòì Yet, I'll leave it as is. Backups reminders can't be wrong.


[21-Feb-20 01:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Talking of backup reminders:
In Verus Desktop `settings` --> `Coin Settings` run:
```
run z_exportwallet walletbackuptxt
```
Which will result in a human readable file with keys/addresses that can be imported trough the `run importwallet "path\walletbackuptxt"` command in a new Verus Desktop.


[21-Feb-20 03:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <maxis7> But verus have a new algo? Not is minable with hashaltcoin f1mini?


[21-Feb-20 03:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> No, HashAltcoin has not made a verushash 2.1 bitstream available for their devices.


[21-Feb-20 04:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <maxis7> @zpajk do you know that hashaltcoin will release the bit to mining verus 2.1?

[21-Feb-20 10:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Robert-> Cause those numbers are extremely low for 200mh/s


[21-Feb-20 10:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Robert-> Should be closer to 80~90 VRSC daily pool mode

[21-Feb-20 10:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Robert-> @Mattaliano only thing I could think of is you are getting many rejections. That would water down your hashrate for sure


[21-Feb-20 10:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Robert-> That would make your 200mh/s effectively much lower. That‚Äôs would have to be an incredibly high rejection rate

[22-Feb-20 09:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hember> the problem is the streaming bandwidth as creators upload any type of files that don't get changed by an algo. They are soon implementing this tech where the creator can choose to optimize the file or not. On youtube the optimization happens even though you don√§t want to. that is another pain in the ass for a creator - and that is not visible for the people who watch youtube.


[22-Feb-20 09:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hember> I have noticed people mocking LBRY have not tried the desktop app and are not creators. For me that is the best tool and platform as a creator.

[dscrdvrsc] <anrahu akeba> I looked back at the video "VerusCoin and BitTube" at 3:42 in Part2, Mike said "it might be giving up without any reward" Users play a role of customers. Their purpose is not to get the reward. Now many video sites we can see ready-made a complete set of mechanisms:producers, users, platforms, advertisers. The platform pays producer the rewards which advertisers payed to platform based on the number of clicks, and I don't see any flaws other than click-throughs. After all, advertisers' money is generated through user spending, and if there is no user spending, advertisers interests are not guaranteed. In fact, we can see that the platform pays users, and they choose some super influential users, such as Sina Weibo. The average user has no value, they are born to be slaughtered because individually they don't create any value, they just consume.At 3:49 in prat 2, Mike said "maybe you are able to really continue to get more information about a user through their ID.But give that information to them so that they can choose to show it. "why? The main purpose of users is to consume, and they spend their time watching videos made by producers to get information or get happiness, which is enough for them. Traditional platforms have acquired most of the uses and all the data of them.So how can IDs continue to get more data?
would you please answer me about this  when you have time?@miketout


[24-Feb-20 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Hollowman9000 , that‚Äôs one of the longest running APIs on first run. It caches and is faster after that. Right now, it‚Äôs even faster than it was. The GUI loads it in pieces and uses the web API until the local node has finished.


[25-Feb-20 12:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @anrahu akeba, I think perhaps some of those concepts relate to the old, aging, and flawed economic model where the individual's data is no more than a product to be bought and sold. It's so easy to do since we've all grown up in such a world but clearly our data being bought/sold *does* have real value to companies, right? Maybe in this new user-centric model, a company would come to you, offering payment for sharing your data, rather than paying your social media provider for *your* data.
Now since you hold full control of your own data it can be truly private, or even shared down to a granular level revealing only the bare minimum (*Example: 
Today's Bouncer- "let me see your ID and all of its info to make sure you are old enough to get in".
Tomorrow's Bouncer- "Are you of age?" Verus ID reveals a verified and simple "yes" - that's all, no address, etc.
New 3rd party social media sites may be structured differently too, to where they'd just pull up profiles that are based off what you choose to link from your self-sovereign Verus ID.


[25-Feb-20 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> To answer your last question- One way your new IDs would continue to get more data is through regular updating, everyday use, and from trusted 3rd party attestations (a verified "World Bank" says John Smith is in fact John Smith, strengthening John's proof that he is who he says. Sure anyone can make an ID that has my name but good luck maintaining that lie. Like having bad credit, who'd believe the imposter? As adoption grows and official notaries get on board, we can expect this to become more and more developed. If I could privately tie my social/ID/license to my Verus ID in a certified way, it'd be a much stronger proof of ID than any one of it's parts- and digital.
Unconscious in a foreign land?-Instant, secure access to medical data for doctors. Maybe google maps pays you to film your street instead of building more cameras cars? Hard to predict how these shiny new tools will get used by others but really, there's likely more uses than we can even fathom right now. It seems it may be time to reassess many of the limitations that we've come to accept as a fact of life.

[25-Feb-20 11:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FlyingDutchman> could verus be used to instantly verify KYC for various services without ahving to actually transmit the personal data?


[25-Feb-20 11:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FlyingDutchman> and for clarification: it is my understanding that vrsc derives its value from a) you need it to buy a verus ID, b) you need it for staking in order to maintain security on those verus IDs


[25-Feb-20 12:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> on the first question, yes. businesses or organizations could use the protocol to enable that.
on the second: a) you buy a VerusID because the VerusID has value in what it enables, and it is also a scarce resource that enables what you can do today and permanently with that resource. That you can buy a VerusID with Verus does determine some amount of value, but that is one of many reasons Verus has value, which I believe always boils down to what it can be used for now and what each person would consider its net present value. Using Verus IDs, you could run polls and elections already, but someone needs to work out the user experience and flow for doing that. You can already sign messages and documents with a revocable, recoverable multisig signature, that can be verified by anyone worldwide, which is quite expensive to do if purchased from centralized services. You can use Verus to track and update public items that are assigned IDs. You can use it for workflow, including legal workflow with multisig, and you can use Verus with Sapilng for transferring money/value across the same network that has those capabilities. With PBaaS, you will be able to power blockchains, which can be defined by people who have IDs. The IDs determine the long term namespace. Not investment advice, but more a technical observation that the service and application opportunities as well as scale and liquidity should grow exponentially when PBaaS enables independent, scalable blockchains, enhanced ID capabilities, external bridging, and easy cross-currency conversions.

[dscrdvrsc] <FlyingDutchman> thanks


[25-Feb-20 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <DLT Novice> Does Verus have a leasing for balance for my stake? Like a POS forging pool that i can point my stake too? The current desktop version windows is too heavy and i have 10K stake but no rewards over one week? I assume its just too heavy to run in the background and freezes although the blocks were always up-to-date. So lease of stake would be handy and allow even more lockup of coins.


[25-Feb-20 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> We don't have lease of stake. Once PBaaS is released on mainnet, the reserve currency of a PBaaS chain can stake. That would mean a staking chain could be created where the users stay in full control of their own coins.


[25-Feb-20 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <allbits> In PBaas will I be able to spin up my own blockchain without having to provision infrastructure (nodes and miners) like I do in komodo?


[25-Feb-20 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FlyingDutchman> so for the use case of IDs issued by a group such as, say, the government, in order to prevent forgery, the blockchain(s) on which the IDs are stored would have to have a "ruler" or set of rulers that has sole permission on whether certain details can or cannot be added to an ID. is this currently possible or will it soon be possible on Verus?


[25-Feb-20 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Zack007> huh


[25-Feb-20 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FlyingDutchman> which part do you need clarification on?


[25-Feb-20 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <FlyingDutchman> let me rephrase: in a situation where there is a single authority controlling the content/details of all IDs on the chain, such as in a government ID scenario, is it currently possible to use a chain this way using Verus?


[25-Feb-20 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @FlyingDutchman IDs are validated by attestation. They do not need to be controlled on a chain to certify or revoke certification from any entity. that said, we do expect to allow an option of chains to have control over issuance of IDs on a specific chain.


[25-Feb-20 08:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <allbits> In PBaas will I be able to spin up my own blockchain without having to provision infrastructure (nodes and miners) like I do in komodo?

I'm trying to get a sense of whether a pbaas chain is a perfect solution for, say, my children's school to set up their own blockchain, with id's, tokens, etc


[25-Feb-20 11:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> One way or another there's a need for nodes to verify and notarize blocks to the chain. You may be able to provide your own (minimal amount of) nodes within the school area to support your own chain or I think you could create a reserve fund to incentivize external (Verus) merged miners to secure your chain for you instead. 
In both cases, no company is involved taking cuts and since all rewards are going directly back to supporters of your chain, costs can be relatively minimal.
Personally, I think that's a great idea @allbits and don't quote me on this but it seems like that's right up PBaaS' alley. üëç üè´ üìö

[26-Feb-20 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <anrahu akeba> @Godballz thank you for your reply.You inspired meÔºåthank you


[26-Feb-20 08:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <allbits> @Godballz thanks - yes I see that the users of the chain, running verus desktop in native mode for the newly created coin, would in fact BE the required infrastructure themselves. I've seen in earlier release notes from the PBaaS testnet that the intention is that verus desktop would provide "automatic wallet support" for anyone who wants to make a new blockchain or currency. And so, the very cool wallet, identity and mining tabs that are in the wallet would be available for any chain, making it super easy and fun for users to stake and mine - I wonder if I'm actually correct about that. If so it will be interesting to see how the wallet presents the virtually infinite number of chains that will be produced.

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @allbits, in testnet there was a look-up that functioned very much like you described. With the merged mining functionality, users could find created Verus chains and add them as new tabs to be mined along with Verus (up to 15x at zero additional electrical costs). üëç

[27-Feb-20 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Robert-> Not sure.
Quick question, when VRSC halving happens again does that also mean that the coins value could go up? Rewards for mining are halved so it‚Äôs harder to acquire. Shouldn‚Äôt that translate to a slight increase in coin value?


[27-Feb-20 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Robert-> Just curious


[27-Feb-20 06:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Robert-> I‚Äôm in it for the long haul but just curious as to what I / we can expect


[27-Feb-20 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> That's in theory what should happen at any halving period but no one knows.


[27-Feb-20 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Robert-> In the past trend with other coins, did that theory hold true?


[27-Feb-20 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> Alternatively, the price does nothing, now it is half as profitable to traditional (for profit) miners, then stop mining, hash goes down, then everyone else makes more coins


[27-Feb-20 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> there's an equilibrium to halving


[27-Feb-20 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Robert-> And the halving only affects mining rewards or both mining and staking?


[27-Feb-20 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> mining and staking


[27-Feb-20 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Robert-> Ahh ok


[27-Feb-20 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Robert-> I thought the algorithm tries to maintain a certain block time and adjust the difficulty after the average of X amount of blocks is greater than 3min?


[27-Feb-20 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Robert-> So even if a bunch of FPGA jump on the algo, it would eventually equal out


[27-Feb-20 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> yes, difficulty adjusts to average out the block times


[27-Feb-20 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> some days it will be more than 1440 blocks, sometimes less, but on average, it should be very close


[27-Feb-20 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> to work out to 1 minute block times


[27-Feb-20 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Robert-> So 1440 is the time it recalculated


[27-Feb-20 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Robert-> Does luckpool track this?


[27-Feb-20 06:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> no, it doesn't adjust after that many blocks, the difficulty algo is quicker than that


[27-Feb-20 06:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> when I say sometimes the blocks are more than 1440 or less, we are talking on the margins. You should never see a day where the network spits out 2880 blocks


[27-Feb-20 06:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Robert-> Oh got it


[27-Feb-20 06:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Robert-> Ty for explaining

[dscrdvrsc] <ùòæùôùùôñùô£ùôòùô§ùôûùô£> I saw many coins price went up before halving, like recent LTC, and thr price either don't change or drop after halving.

[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> @anrahu akeba IDs can be transferred. This has not been built into Verus-Desktop yet, but can be done through the CLI interface using the command `updateidentity` and changing the Primary Address. This does require some insight in how to format the input on CLI though.

[dscrdvrsc] <allbits> Anyone here familiar with urbit.org? In a very recent blog post they said "Urbit is ‚Äî to my knowledge ‚Äî the first practical application of a decentralized ID system that actually works."  Their focus is different from verus, and perhaps there is a way of working together - although nobody ever does that in crypto!

* They could migrate to a PBaas-chain. 
* 4B IDs: Not enough for the entire population of the earth.
* Money seems the motivation. encourages separating between the haves and have-nots.
* No trustless system like VerusID.

[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> @Hollowman9000 My stakes over the last 6 weeks have been bad. Figured that would be plenty of time to average out but so far it hasn't been getting better

[04-Mar-20 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <allbits> ROI in the network has been decreasing noticeably over the last couple of weeks - more coins have been staking. Also, this will always be true for you over time as fifty percent of the supply is added by mining, and then those coins are staked. Unless you keep buying, your relative percentage of the float decreases.


[04-Mar-20 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Hollowman9000> Of course that should be non-sensical (agama vs desktop), I don‚Äôt think the daemon changed


[04-Mar-20 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> @allbits Maybe I'm viewing it the wrong way, but if you have x percentage of the current supply, and assume no locked coins exist (the entire supply is staking), you should be able to, on average, get that same percentage of the daily blocks. This of course assumes you have an actual meaningful amount. For instance, if you have 1% of the circulating coins, it seems highly probable that you should get about 14.4 blocks a day, which seems inline with what the estimates are in Verus Desktop. I'm well aware it's 50/50 pow/pos but in my experience, up until about mid January, this percentage of outstanding coins held true over longer periods of time. It's also safe to assume that not all the coins are staking.


[04-Mar-20 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> I would say I'm averaging about 65-75% of my expected daily stakes, on average.


[04-Mar-20 04:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <allbits> I agree with that generally, with the exception that I've noticed, in the last two weeks, expected ROI consistently in the high teens as opposed to the ~30% that it often was before that.  It appears that a larger portion of coins are now staking than was the norm before. Perhaps partially due to the excellent new interface that makes it easier and more fun to stake.


[04-Mar-20 10:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> You're right about a huge amount of staking supply coming online. We used to have about 21 million coins staking, and now the network is estimating about 36.3 million.


[04-Mar-20 11:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> That makes sense and seems about right with the numbers on estimated earnings that my wallets have changed to for the last week. Numbers have gone from almost 30% down to about 19%. But today I am suddenly looking at Est. Earnings 1.97% ROI, which seems a bit low. All my UTXO's are staking on all my wallets, so it has nothing to do with being locked in cooldown. One wallet estimates 0.06 blocks per day right now, but it still staked 2 blocks just an hour apart only 6 hours ago. With current numbers that would be considered lucky and above average for a whole month. That also leads me to think that there is a display error or something causing the calculation to be off since this would imply more than 300 million coins are staking (which is impossible). I will give one of my wallets a close down and restart to see if it changes, to satisfy Mr. Justin Case.


[05-Mar-20 12:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cozacrypto> Was just thinking the same thing. Have gone from 3-4 blocks a day and 25-30% ROI down to 0.28 blocks a day and -2.38% ROI in less than 12 Hrs.


[05-Mar-20 12:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cozacrypto> GOing on the est earnings in the wallet.


[05-Mar-20 03:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Caribu66> Hi, How many coins do we need to stack in order to get a decent stacking change to hit something?


[05-Mar-20 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Panho> https://wiki.veruscoin.io/#!faq-allos/faq-allos06_pos,_halving,_block_reward.md


[05-Mar-20 04:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> @Caribu66 The staking spreadsheet works fine as long as you make sure to insert the appropriate amount of total coins staking. Mike just mentioned that the network estimates a total of 36.3 million coins actually staking (out of a est. total supply currently at 50.55 million coins), so make sure to use a percentage (85% should work) that reflects this and it should give you a good idea of what will be the average given enough time. Currently with 85% of total supply staking that means you would average 1 block (24 coins) per day with 59,500 VRSC staking.
The newest version of the Verus Desktop wallet has been displaying estimates based on the network for daily, monthly and yearly ROI, and it has been working well up until the last day or so. Right now my own wallets are showing estimates that seem to be way off, and I haven't figured out why yet. I tried restarting one of them, but that changed nothing. Cozacrypto seems to be getting the same numbers, so it's not just me. I would base my calculations on the spreadsheet for now until this mystery is solved üôÇ Also remember, there will be a halving later this year, so blockreward will drop from 24 to 12 coins per block. This will happen at block 1,219,680 if the spreadsheet is correct, and that will come close to end of September.

[dscrdvrsc] <jimboscott> Strange - Verus Desktop's Staking Calculator is showing about 1/10 of what it usually does...


[05-Mar-20 06:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gwnm> Yes, rewards have really dropped off. My wallets were showing only 1.6% staking ROI earlier today. Solo mining from the wallet is also a lot less. My 30Mhs cpu's are now taking between 4 and 8 days to hit a block not the 1 to 2 days that was normal until about 2 weeks ago.  Right now network hash is only 40Ghs and still drought! Might the network be overly affected by the roughly 100Ghs that keeps popping on and off the network from an unknown source not identified on miningpoolstats?


[05-Mar-20 07:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> Like discussed just above here and also in Staking, wallet seems to be off on estimates right now. People report on getting more or less the same as average has been for the last week, so probably just a display error in the wallet or something temporarily making the estimates being wrong. My guess is we will hear something about it soon, or it will resolve by itself. @jimboscott

[dscrdvrsc] <zpajk> Discord bots can be multiplicated easily, when this happens please focus on reporting the github user if you can.


[05-Mar-20 11:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I wrote Github too just to add to the pile and stress the urgency. I also included a description of Verus Desktop's free and open-source digital signature verification tool in hope they consider  looking into it further since it'd be mutually beneficial- our and all user's improved security, as well as a very real way for them to address and eliminate this ongoing issue at no cost to them. I don't see why they wouldn't want that, it's a win-win.

The Foundations of a New Digital Era ‚Äî Self-Sovereign Identities

Great piece explaining the reason for decentralized self-sovereign identities.

@hhn_t1 check out #VerusCoin (#VerusID). It checks all the boxes plus revokable, recoverable. Proceeds go to miners and stakers. #...

[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> hi guys


[06-Mar-20 12:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> what "piece explaining the reason for decentralized self-sovereign identities" ?


[06-Mar-20 12:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> @Godballz wrote something?

[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Just reported the Github account the DM-spam referred to. It should be taken down quickly.


[06-Mar-20 03:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> @gigamesh just reported the spam to Github as well. What I meant above was that I just included info on how they might be able to use the new Verus Desktop's digital signature verification tool to fix their system to hopefully eliminate this problem finally.

[06-Mar-20 08:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <cybertrucker> On the discussion about staking rewards going down due to so much staking... I see this for two reasons. 
1. Less coins on exchanges (likely cause our top exchange shutdown)
2. CPU algorithm tweaks have worked and are keeping coins in the hands of true believers
I think this is really healthy for the coin long term.

[07-Mar-20 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> @Hollowman9000 On the issue og tx list showing z-transactions as only 101 confs or so (and thereby not showing up chronologically), this can be fixed by going to Settings -> General settings -> Native and in the "Native Cache Size Limit (in Mb)" change the value to 0 (zero). It is set defaul to 30 iirc. Press save changes, close wallet and restart for the change to take effect.

[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto278> @Hollowman9000 because a lot of people do not know about Verus. If we were on a bigger exchange there would be more volume because more people would know about it

[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - Monkins> **recap on what's being developed**


[11-Mar-20 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Chris - Monkins> We're focusing on it now. We have the following items in progress, and as some of it will enable a new level of liquidity in response to the failure of centralized exchanges, our priority is mainnet, though there will be a testnet beforehand. The difference in this plan is that we can't yet say when it will be ready on testnet, but if it takes longer to get to testnet because we want fewer changes before it's ready for mainnet, we will take the path that leads to an earlier mainnet. We have some extremely exciting work in progress, and there will be a testnet before all of it is ready. The current items in progress include (but are not limited to):
1. Tokens on the Verus blockchain, controlled by normal addresses and IDs, which represent PBaaS currencies, centrally controlled currencies bound to an ID, or externally bridged currencies, which can be sent back and forth from another blockchain or system.
2. A decentralized bridge protocol to other blockchains (PBaaS or external) to enable BTC, ETH, USDT or other currencies to be imported, exported, and represented in the Verus network.
3. Multicurrency fractional reserve currencies that can use tokens as reserves with Verus-developed fractional reserve math that enables a basket of reserves to serve as both a naturally re-balancing cryptocurrency basket, and also a way to convert from one reserve currency to another. All conversions between any two cryptocurrencies will get the same rate in any single block for both buys and sells (no front-running), with a miner/staker conversion fee of 0.025% in the native blockchain currency.
4. Sapling z-transaction support for all multicurrency fractional reserve currencies
5. Quantum secure signatures with multisig for ID-based spending and signing with retroactive quantum resistance for all funds sent to an ID
6. Staking from ID funds and also staking of Verus reserves as a reward for auto-notarization.
7. Mobile support for IDs and z-transactions.

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> So many people are working so hard on making a really good project even better and it is a bit more than a little annoying when the same one or two people only come around here to complain and give the least helpful criticisms. You said it yourself, you've been here 40 days- a month and a week- and are popping in periodically through that short time to pass judgment. Many of us have been here close to two years and have witnessed the expected standard crypto ups and downs and through all this, Verus has actually remained relatively stable in comparison. Is it simply frustration that you can't cash out into BTC (as you've mentioned repeatedly you're only here for) for short-term profits this day of the week?
The GLOBAL stock market is in turmoil, actually oil too even, there's panic of a worldwide viral outbreak, while your beloved Bitcoin and most other cryptos are seeing record lows too. 
There will always be a small minority of the weak and scared crying "the sky is falling" but what good does that ever do?
On the subject of "shitcoins"- I can't stand when words are abused and thrown around so loosely they lose meaning, spewed carelessly whenever you have a bad day. People are working very hard, accomplishing things that have never been done before, proving concepts that many considered flat out impossible, and what have you done besides shout "shitcoin" from the rafters every chance you get. Please, define shitcoin for me.. I do not believe this project fits under any applicable definition and frankly it is insulting to those who're here that actually *do* care about this project and have watched it develop for much longer than 40 days. If you see this as a sinking ship, sell me all your coins at buy-order price now while you still can please and find another place to push the shitcoin shit-talk.

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> If you've paid attention or knew anything about this project you'd know that Verus does not hype or make hollow promises- only results talk here and at each turn, through the few negative nancy's, Verus has met or exceeded expectations. Name me another decentralized CPU mineable project that has remained CPU mineable throughout it's existence. Can you name me one that let's you send coins to your own name? Has their own hardware inclusive algorithm? Is a true community project with passionate contributors spread across the globe? Did you miss the post above outlining the current and next steps in accomplishing the vision (That nice long post that was thoughtfully numbered out for you and your convenience and kindly added by yet another community contributor)?


[11-Mar-20 11:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I hate to add to this here in #general-discussion though and will gladly move or remove this post but people talking like this who just show up one day to complain really gets on my nerves..


[11-Mar-20 11:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Especially since I know for a fact that so many good people are working very hard on this project and thoughtless comments like that serve no good purpose other than let people know what kind of people are the fair-weather-friends

[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Seems standard practice has been- push it off till it's someone else's problem..
Just another reason a non-inflationary currency is, at the very least, a step in the right direction. Perhaps made a bit more difficult by the fact that both must exist together (at least for the time being).

[dscrdvrsc] <Panho> Hi Mike @miketout !
Are you going to include DAG-like blockchains in the future Verus ecosystem? For example, Nano. The guys have been developing it for several years as a pure means of payment - They do not pretend to the functionality of IDs and smart contracts - only pure crypto money. However, there is a significant drawback: the complete transparency of the blockchain. The Zk-snark will help here. I mean Verus as a repository of value, and Nano (like other DAG) as a payment channel with lightning fast transactions and zero commission üôÇ


[18-Mar-20 11:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Panho that is possible with our cross-chain/system technology, but our priority as we release PBaaS is to plug directly into the decentralized financial system, provide better defi protocols that people need today and can use from all of the biggest external systems. Our first priorities for interop are BTC, ETH, and USD, because it isn't technology we need. That is a strength we bring. Right now, we need to roll out PBaaS and solve the question of liquidity in the Verus ecosystem once and for all, independent of any listing on any exchange of any size. After that, we will be focused on next stages of the vision and will publish ways that any ecosystem, centralized or decentralized, will be able to bridge to the Verus ecosystem via protocol. I suspect many will want to at that point, but to get there, we need to just get the work that has been in progress out for people to experience and use.
We are also working in conjunction with some efforts to make a difference with Verus technology in helping with COVID-19 response. I hope we will be able to talk about some of these things soon, but in any case, you will be able to try out the new and greatly improved PBaaS with multi-reserve currencies in the near future.
Back to focus on it for me üôÇ I hope everyone in our community is staying healthy and safe through this challenging time.

[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @DCAL4 We are doing what we can to stay healthy. Meanwhile, I've tried to stay focused on development. Many of us, me included, have been working 7 days a week since Jan to meet the needs of companies/govts that we are working to support with Verus PBaaS. We are largely code complete, with a few things left, and I am working on pre-testnet testing right now. There is a great deal in progress behind the scenes, and we have been so busy that I keep postponing an update until the time we have a testnet up, and I can relax a tiny bit üôÇ COVID-19 has made some things more difficult, but also has made it that much more critical that we enable Verus to be used by people in a way that can make a real difference. Just know that many of us across the community are working as hard as we can to get this out, and we are making great progress. I do hope we will have the multi-currency PBaaS testnet up and usable this week.

[dscrdvrsc] <Avia Sativa> I don't want my transactions tracked, not that I have anything to hide, but because I value privacy

[24-Mar-20 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Avia Sativa> if you exchange your crypto for usd, you have to add it to your taxes


[24-Mar-20 05:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Avia Sativa> but as long as it's in an exchange or wallet, you don't have to add it to your tax form


[24-Mar-20 06:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <paul0215> @Avia Sativa thanks for the information


[24-Mar-20 06:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto278> @Avia Sativa that's not true. If you trade BTC for another coin, That is considered a sale and you have to report it


[24-Mar-20 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto278> So when I sell my BTC for Verus it has to be reported. I use cointracking.com. It is a great program, they even put everything on the tax forms for you as long as you input your trades correctly.

As a reference to upcoming PBaaS, I could totally see it being right up that alley and zk-SNARKs could actually afford much better privacy. Really fascinating, I can imagine a bright future using crypto-micropayments for all sorts of things in everyday jobs or even for new ones like helping people on the streets who'd maybe want to pitch in cleaning up a park or something so that they can afford a meal, or other yet to be made cool voluntary services (once whole cities/states eventually get on board). üëç

[26-Mar-20 11:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> You will need to have your revocation and recovery authoritties set to an existing ID. The ID you assigned revoking rights can revoke your ID and the ID you assigned your recovery authority to can recover your ID t a new set of keys.


[27-Mar-20 12:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Panho> OK!  :)
Anyone know what a difference between revocation and recovery of Verus ID?


[27-Mar-20 12:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> recall... I think you mean revocation. It disables the ID, so nobody can use that ID to make transactions or sign messages / files. In case your keys are compromised the funds in your ID-address (i-address) can not be moved away.
Recovery is the process of assigning new keys to your address (eg a newly generated R-address with new WIF and if desired the same for a z-address), which activates the ID and anyone with access to those new addresses can transfer and sign using that ID.


[27-Mar-20 12:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Compare revocation to calling your bank to block your credit-card, because you lost it.
Compare recovery to the bank sending you a new card (with the same accountdetails) but with a new card number and PIN. Only now you're not depending on a third party, you are fully in control (and responsible) of that process.


[27-Mar-20 12:30 AM] Gateway#3763

Hopefully Verus can get in on a way to help these major companies.

[dscrdvrsc] <Artist> guys what is verusid?


[01-Apr-20 11:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Artist> in simple terms


[01-Apr-20 11:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mining Spec> https://wiki.veruscoin.io/#!information/verusid.md


[01-Apr-20 11:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Mining Spec> VerusIDs can be used to receive and send funds, which are controlled by the single or multi-sig addresses specified in the identity itself. If these controlling addresses or the single or multi-sig properties are changed, which can be done by the controller of the identity, all future spends of UTXOs sent to that identity follow the updated spend conditions and are subject to the updated keys. Although Verus 0.6.2 does not include quantum resistant signatures for transactions, Verus IDs are themselves resistant to quantum attack with known algorithms, and we have already started to integrate a quantum secure signature scheme, which we expect to activate on mainnet early next year. When that is available, it will be possible to change an ID and have all of the funds sent to it made retroactively quantum resistant. Verus IDs can also be used to publish ID->destination address mappings on other blockchains, but only the Verus ecosystem has the ability to revoke, recover, inherit, funds in existing UTXOs.


[01-Apr-20 11:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Artist> these aren't simple terms my man


[01-Apr-20 11:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> It is an ID that you manage yourself completely, you don't need any authorization from anybody to create.
You can receive attestations from 3rd parties on it, to prove something about the ID-holder.
The ID-holder is in full control what info is shared with somebody else.
The ID is able to sign messages and files, that anyone can verify (don't need an ID to verify)


[01-Apr-20 11:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Artist> what is ID in this context


[01-Apr-20 11:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Identity. Which can correspond to a real life identity, or to represent anything you want.


[01-Apr-20 11:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Apart from having a digital identity that you could use in daily life.
An attestation on the ID could prove that you're of legal age. Showing that attestestion could be sufficient to grant you access to age-limited stores, without disclosing info that is currently showing on your phisical ID, supplied by the government.
On a subchain you could assign an ID to an individual product and transfer it from address to address, thus creating a tracking system for a supply chain.

[dscrdvrsc] <Artist> yes but why


[01-Apr-20 12:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> In native mode, along with having your own copy of the blockchain data, you have a wallet.dat that contains all of your addresses- and now Verus IDs too- so you own them and they are associated with your wallet. Lite mode doesn't store chain data on your device but instead uses an external server to access the chain. As Oink said, this is simply how Verus IDs were first made available to us and likely made the most sense for users to be able to own and control their very own self-sovereign identities right away but this will likely change going forward to allow for broader use cases and for mobile users @Artist

[01-Apr-20 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Indeed, both private addresses and IDs will return the change to the originating address (or ID) when transferring funds. It will be easier to track for the user and ensures that when an ID is revoked, all the funds are frozen, without the risk of a change address being left behind.

[dscrdvrsc] <Artist> guys how long does it usually take to download zcash par


[02-Apr-20 01:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Artist> also what does pbaas stand for


[02-Apr-20 02:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> zcash parameters are about 1.5 GB althogether, so the time that takes heavily depends n your internet connection.
PBaaS stands for *Public Blockchain as a Service*
Basically allowing you to start a blockchain without having to supply the infrastructure yourself.


[02-Apr-20 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Artist> is pbaas used in verus?


[02-Apr-20 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Artist> where like in mining or etc?


[02-Apr-20 02:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> it's not in Verus-Desktop yet, since we don't have it on mainnet or testnet yet.


[02-Apr-20 05:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Just wanna add it was said in another channel that we are very close to having PBaaS on testnet though. Actually, PBaaS was briefly in testnet a little while back, where many users created their own merge mineable chains but for some good reasons, self-sovereign digital identity became a priority and went to testnet- and now mainnet with the idea that it'd make for an overall better PBaaS in the end @Artist.

[dscrdvrsc] <wwhitley> Good afternoon to you all, I hope you are all safe. PA has 58oo plus cases of the virus.


[02-Apr-20 10:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bball> Afternoon ..  CO is sitting at 3.3k, I think we are in for a bad next 7 days.  I have heard that tests are not available, but have no fact to back that up.


[02-Apr-20 10:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã> ironically if only fraction of those bailouts wre put into medical service last years they would be prepared to handl covid19 and could be no need to stop economy... now it is needed to pay much bigger price and not sure how it will work out for society


[02-Apr-20 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <DCAL4> @wwhitley how are you holding up? You feel any better?


[02-Apr-20 01:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <wwhitley> @DCAL4 Had to video chat with Doctorand Received meds to help. Thank for asking.

[dscrdvrsc] <superslack> can anyone explain what verus ID is and how it works?


[02-Apr-20 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto278> @superslack scroll up to yesterday message  oink explained it


[02-Apr-20 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto278> @Crypto278 also go to verus identity thread. Lots of answers there


[02-Apr-20 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> There should be plenty of info on the website or if you use the search function here in Discord you'll find that that question has been asked/answered a few times. This is one of the more recent answers and a nice sum up- https://discordapp.com/channels/444621794964537354/449638035999686677/676719427345055754


[02-Apr-20 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> What @Crypto278 said^^. There's plenty more to read and learn, so afterward you may want to check out the website too (<https://veruscoin.io/>) and read the vision paper & whitepaper @superslack


[02-Apr-20 06:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <agoons> I dont know if anyone else read this, but there is a bunch of news articles floating around about allowing United States senators and house members vote remotely. This may be a great use case for verus coin.


[03-Apr-20 04:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <agoons> Does anyone, by chance, have inroads with any politicians?

[dscrdvrsc] <DCAL4> Question, more out of curiosity. Will an updated wallet drop near the PBAAS testnet launch? Everything is working well with the current so no urgency, just wondering.

[08-Apr-20 03:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Work is in progress to get z-address transactions to lite mode (ref: https://discordapp.com/channels/444621794964537354/555244008289337364/692576661912289311), which is needed to show attestations to an ID on your mobile phone.
I don't know if the implementation is going to be unique for Verus, or if the implementation can be used for any ZEC-fork. If the latter is the case, I personally think it would be possible to implement that at some point in time into Verus-Desktop as well.

[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto278> @miketout  allbits post. Is this something verus should be in on?


[09-Apr-20 11:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Crypto278 @allbits absolutely on the virtual summit. I have no time to engage now. Perhaps @Consilience might engage on looking into it or ask someone to do so as well. As far as I know, we have the most well thought out solution being built right now for contact tracing, testing certification, benefit distribution and onboarding. We are working to get detailed information on how all that works with VerusID and soon PBaaS in a state to be shared. For those who have joined the marketing call recently and are on the #marketing-backoffice channel, I will drop a link to the current information so the community can prepare to support the broader announcements when they are made. We are working to get everything out to the masses in a fairly coordinated way, rather than leaking bits at a time. We're also in discussions with numerous parties who are expecting to use the technology as soon as we release it.

[dscrdvrsc] <Crypto278> Okay I am definatly not the one qualified to sign up for that virtual summit. Who would that be? It starts 4/11 so there is a time crunch.


[09-Apr-20 12:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <allbits> @Consilience  David Vorick, CEO of Nebulous Labs is quite involved in blockcovid. He and Manasi Vora, head of Product Strategy at Nebulous are open to hearing from you and perhaps seeing how veruscoin/valu fit in. Should I intro you?


[09-Apr-20 12:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Consilience> Yes that would be great

[dscrdvrsc] <Oszy> ***Dear Verus community! ***

The Voting for the Komodo Notary Elections has begun today.
If you were holding some KMD in your wallet, Verus Desktop,Komodo Ocean,Ledger or Trezor, you have been airdropped some VOTE2020 tokens to your Komodo address.

You can use these to Vote token to send for your preferred candidate(s) voting address in the yearly election.
A Notary Node  is a core part of the Komodo Blockchain doing the Delayed Proof of Work (dPow) for the Komodo blockchain and other 3rd party blockchains.

**How to send the tokens?**
The next release of Verus Desktop wallet will support VOTE2020
From CLI or Komodo Ocean, start the chain and import your KMD private key: `./komodod -ac_public=1 -ac_name=VOTE2020 -ac_supply=123651638 -addnode=95.213.238.98`
From Ledger / Trezor : https://pbca26.github.io/hw-kmd-wallet/

I hope you find this little information useful, and let me grab the opportunity to read my proposal and give a vote for me if you feel I deserve it.
https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/NotaryNodes/tree/master/season4/candidates/oszy

The full list of candidates and the voting's current status can be seen here thanks to @CHMEX 
https://vote.dexstats.info/

The voting period will last until May 4, 2020. The newly-elected Notary Node Operators will be announced on May 11.

[14-Apr-20 02:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Artist> I guess thats just fair


[14-Apr-20 02:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Let me explain a bit why I feel this way:
VOTE2020 is airdropped to KMD holders, not to holders of any coins in asset chains. Most people that hold KMD are also in KMD discord. A lot of people interested in Verus do not hold any KMD, nor are they in KMD discord. For them Notary-Node-Election information is something out-of-context.


[14-Apr-20 03:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Gordon Komodo> maybe off-topic is okay


[14-Apr-20 03:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Indeed. Thanks @Gordon Komodo for pointing that out.


[14-Apr-20 06:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <0x03 (BloodyNora)> FYI - since it was mentioned here anyways:
if you're doing like me and importing single addresses to your `VOTE2020` wallet - you may miss coins. i only got them all when i copied over the kmd wallet.dat (it may need a rescan, it didnt for me appearantly)
what happened was the snapshot happened right in a block where i 'claimed interest' - so all my balance was on a change addr.


[14-Apr-20 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Oszy> sorry @ùôäùôûùô£ùô† I thought the verus community at least cares about who's doing the dPow for Verus. I won't post more here üôÇ

[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> @Oszy I voiced my personal feelings, open to feedback from the community. The feedback made me adjust my personal opinion.

[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> @Oszy I just noticed the message campaigning for votes has been removed, so I understand your reaction better now. My post was not about the announcement you made, but about the campaigning.


[14-Apr-20 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <allbits> @miketout in a previous update you wrote
"a decentralized bridge protocol to other blockchains (PBaaS or external) to enable BTC, ETH, USDT or other currencies to be imported, exported, and represented in the Verus network."

I've been thinking about this a lot as it seems so amazingly ground-breaking.  Do I interpret this correctly, that I could send btc to a certain address, that would then cause that btc to be represented in the verus network at a verus address that I control? And then, from there, I could send those verus-network-represented "btc" to another address in the verus network and, eventually someone else who received those "btc" could send them out of the verus network to a btc address of his choosing?

[dscrdvrsc] <mercadinaut> @allbits There have been many other efforts in this area. Komodo‚Äôs predecessor SuperNet did this on the Nxt blockchain. In the ETH DeFi world, Kyber, Bancor, √òx, Synthetix and Aragon‚Äôs smart wrapper all offer broadly similar functionality, albeit relying on the Ethereum blockchain. 

Folks might want to have a look at REN, which is a generic interoperability protocol that supports trade between different blockchains. Their underlying RenVM is taking privacy tech further than zk-SNARKS to include zk-compute and zk-storage as well. While they are focusing their work on DeFi on the Ethereum chain at the moment, their tech can work with any blockchain. See :-

[dscrdvrsc] <allbits> @mercadinaut I'm sorry but the references to mgw and wbtc are to things that do not compare to the functionality I quoted. I await a response from the developers. Let's not waste space debating here please. As far as I know you do not know what is being developed.

[15-Apr-20 06:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yeah, I think the reference/discussion would be better suited in #off-topic tbh but after looking into those projects, they all seem to rely on somewhat complex dependencies through the use of multiple layered blockchains that must all work together where Verus elegantly achieves interoperability *on-chain* at *protocol level* with zk-SNARKs privacy already built in.
I'll continue what I wrote here in #off-topic..

A COVID-19 app without compromise
As governments are gearing up to have COVID-19 apps ready for contact tracing and diagnose attestations we, the public, are afraid these apps will end up compromising our privacy. Privacy In the blockchain communities I'm active this is a very hot topic.

[dscrdvrsc] <MrBizzy> "Truth and privacy for all" Am i only one here that do not see this rhyming with contradictions that are around covid and tagging people based on dubious assumptions? For Verus to push so hard just to be "useful" in a (potential) scam on par with world wars? 
Or all you can see people is the growth in price?


[18-Apr-20 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> @MrBizzy I think you might have this backwards. Verus is pushing to get an app ready that will make it possible to warn people if they have been in contact with someone who has later been identified as sick, so they can get tested themselves and hopefully help contain the virus and stop the spread. And all this without collecting and uploading personal data, but with a solution that protects everyone‚Äôs privacy. I suggest you read back on the posts by Mike to get a better understanding of what is being developed. Also always a good idea to read the vision paper, and you will learn that ¬´Truth and privacy for all¬ª is not just a gimmick slogan.


[18-Apr-20 03:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> The urgency is caused both by the need to stop the spread asap, and to prevent bad alternatives on the app side to get traction. We are already seing apps being tested and distributed that are basically robbing people of their privacy, and that needs to stop.


[18-Apr-20 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> Anyway, time is of the essence, but Verus will not release any app or tech until it has been tested properly and are ready for mainnet.


[18-Apr-20 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <MrBizzy> The urgency is there to stop lies  and manipulation. Not to go along with it.

[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> "Truth and Privacy for all" with respect to Verus in the current CoVid-19 situation:
- The fact whether the Corona-situation is indeed the way the media /governments / institutions present it, is debatable. It is, however, not something that Verus has any effect nor influence on. The fact is that the majority has accepted the situation and information available around this, makes the crisis real. We'll let the future decide what is real and what is not.
- Given the general perception of the crisis, people have the right to privacy. As @Cragorn mentioned: Verus strives to provide a solution to avoid collecting and uploading personal data and protects everyone‚Äôs privacy. The speed at which most governments move towards implementing a Covid-19 contact tracing app, taking shortcuts to speed up the development and implementation, may (intentionally or not) put peoples privacy at risk. People may be willing to wave the privacy issue at this time, for the benefit of the greater good, but there's no guarantee they can reverse that decision in the future. Implementing a privacy sustainable suolution now that has the same effect on tracking contacts is therefore paramount. I would like to emphasize here that Verus is using zk-SNARKS to handle the contact information and only the owner of the keys (the user) to those z-transactions is capable of releasing that information. Nobody else, hence privacy is kept.


[18-Apr-20 11:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> - Lack of information is the most common reason for flawed decisions. Anyone that has managed a crisis (big or small) knows that decisions have to be made on incomplete data. Data doesn't lie. People can interpret that information. The more context there is, the better the information can be interpreted and the harder it gets to misinterpret the information available. By tracking contact information in a reliable and privacy aware way, a verified infected user of the Verus-app enables people that have been in the users proximity to be tested. This contributes to the truth in general and a persons truth in particular: by getting people at risk of infection the ability to check if they were infected or not. The result of a certified test takes away the uncertainty of not knowing to a high degree.
So even if one questions the validity of the information available now, Verus' efforts towards a CoVid-19-app is focussed on bringing Truth and Privacy to the people in this respect.

@DCAL4  That is a possibily, also because the coin supply is more than half as low. Lower coin supply = easier rise to dollars. VERUS has the potential to go much higher than $12.

[19-Apr-20 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <DCAL4> If it achieved that same market cap I believe so. I had forgotten that KMD is 200 million supply.


[19-Apr-20 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <DJpsypher> Verus 51 mil circulating


[19-Apr-20 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <DJpsypher> half the supply of ETH as well


[19-Apr-20 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <anrahu akeba> Everything about the price is imagination, and the foundation of the foundation starts with PBaaS. I think we can look forward to the release of testnet, excited about what Michael said about blockchain interoperability, and curious about how he did it, and how far he's come.

[dscrdvrsc] <DJpsypher> When people find out what Verus really is, IMO that's when its going to take off. Even crypto gurus do not what Verus is I guess. Or they think its just another random crypto.

[dscrdvrsc] <DJpsypher> I have a huge bitcoin business instagram account with almost 6K followers, but i have not mentioned anything about Verus on there. I'm not sure if the community really wants me to do that, so yeah.

[dscrdvrsc] <DCAL4> I am wanting more accumulation time...just a guess but I think we will get a few more months in the current range. I think the last quarter of this year may be bonkers in a good way. Who knows though

It's not DeFi if your smart contract has functionality that enables someone with an admin key to alter how the contract works. That's just CeFi running on a slow virtual machine with an incredibly expensive database.

[dscrdvrsc] <Mining Spec> We've seen BNB skyrocket in price. COSS and Kucoin did the same in 2017, which made me wonder if decentralized exchanges and it's native coins will be the next big thing?

[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> very cool tho https://valu.earth/img/SkyviewPilot.pdf


[22-Apr-20 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> this is a great initiative and very cool to see these technologies in Verus finding practical and important utility. whether they land this contract, and they probably wont assuming Google are offering an alternative, I can foresee similar deals happening


[22-Apr-20 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> very very interesting


[22-Apr-20 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> i'll keep digging on this org and find connections


[22-Apr-20 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> A major problem with google and in general this track/trace tech catching on is trust though and this is shaping up to be a superior solution and a step in the righ direction for gaining trust and actual use for enough to give useful data


[22-Apr-20 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> has Mike already told us how Verus got involved in the first place?


[22-Apr-20 03:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Santosthegreat.vrsc@> Not entirely


[22-Apr-20 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Santosthegreat.vrsc@> His tweets and what not lately have been dropping hints I think


[22-Apr-20 03:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> @Godballz the quality of the solution is not the hurdle here, it's Google reputation and dominance (and lobbyists) and the fact selectors will "play it safe" when picking a solution


[22-Apr-20 03:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Santosthegreat.vrsc@> There will be users that demand this level of privacy


[22-Apr-20 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> I do see that as an unfortunate obstacle tbh but this has exactly what is missing in so many of the mainstream solutions which is trust and very real privacy


[22-Apr-20 03:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> i foresee a great future but if its Valu vs Google then I wouldnt get your hopes up

[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> sssh.. Mike is typing


[22-Apr-20 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> The tracing system will be a solution that can interoperate with centralized tracing solutions that use the Apple/Android protocol. For the attestations, I don't think someone else has an ID alternative that can do what is needed, respect privacy, and is deployed.


[22-Apr-20 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yes, thanks all. So very exciting!!

[dscrdvrsc] <Lucivere> Do say hi to us;)


[22-Apr-20 03:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> so possible collaboration then?


[22-Apr-20 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @gigamesh if you mean collaboration with Google/Apple, it isn't needed for compatibility in the protocol


[22-Apr-20 03:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> not sure if you caught the part about our change in tracking protocol


[22-Apr-20 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the issue is that our original design used HD wallets handing out zk-addresses, since we will soon have z-txes in the mobile wallet


[22-Apr-20 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> when Apple and Google announced their protocol, it is pretty clear that cannot be ignored


[22-Apr-20 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> they did actually attempt to make a protocol that can claim to preserve privacy to a certain degree, and though I see holes in the way it can be combined with big data, it is a legitimate, not pruposefully orwellian protocol


[22-Apr-20 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> the way it works is that you only publish information relative to your own data, and to determine if you have interacted with someone who has published a positive diagnosis


[22-Apr-20 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> you need to check where they publish, run an algorithm, and correlate


[22-Apr-20 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> that means for any interop, you only need to get the published/public data and correlate


[22-Apr-20 03:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> you still don't know who it is


[22-Apr-20 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> but you might be able to figure it out with other data


[22-Apr-20 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we will publish on Verus, and we will support other, centralized publishing points


[22-Apr-20 03:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> about compatibiltiy tho: Apple/Google's solution provides some kind of API that Valu could feed data into ?


[22-Apr-20 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Attestations cannot be tampered with and information can be shared granularly though right? Not sure that can be matched by *any* centralized solution


[22-Apr-20 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> that means that any app can be compatible with Verus by reading from the blockchain. we can be compatible with everyone by supporting them. if you have one that works with everyone else and one that doesn't, no matter how big they are, you get more value out of the one that works with everyone, and there is no downside as a user


[22-Apr-20 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @Godballz also true


[22-Apr-20 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> but I am only referring to contact tracing


[22-Apr-20 03:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> we will have things they simply don't yet have tech for


[22-Apr-20 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> ah so you provide the tools/API that others can tap into?


[22-Apr-20 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> exactly


[22-Apr-20 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> cool


[22-Apr-20 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> and an open source implementation of a privacy preserving app that anyone can use, which also happens to be a wallet with z-address support, IDs, and provable attestations


[22-Apr-20 03:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> so, companies or countries could easily adapt/adopt after release


[22-Apr-20 03:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> awesome. is is too complicated to explain how this all started, who these guys are, and who is funding it (i'm guessing private investors?)


[22-Apr-20 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> i should check for an *About* section on the site

[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> would love to know the genesis here


[22-Apr-20 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> right now, it is. I met Ron Kim and Robert Hockett when I traveled to NY in Jan. we can talk about all the details later, but for now, I'm not sure which parts I can say about other people's projects, and I should actually get back onto testnet for PBaaS üòâ that will be a whole additional set of fun things to talk about that are also new.


[22-Apr-20 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <miketout> @gigamesh I will be happy to discuss with you, as I know you can go deep into these things. there is a story behind it all. just can't now üôÇ


[22-Apr-20 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> awesome ,id love to cover i


[22-Apr-20 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Besides transfer of value, it's so very nice to see blockchain technology being put to solid use besides what many might only see as for gambling and speculation. This is what is so desperately needed and gives real legitimacy to the tech. Not to mention drawing attention and new eyes, giving a good name to blockchain for new and previously not associated companies or uses. This is so very important a step forward.

[22-Apr-20 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Through an attestation


[22-Apr-20 04:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> ?


[22-Apr-20 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> a legal document


[22-Apr-20 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> An entity that is trustworthy attesting that this identity belongs to you


[22-Apr-20 04:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Attestation will be recorded on your ID.


[22-Apr-20 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Privately that is, so you can reveal it to others, but ONLY you can


[22-Apr-20 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> but those who attest hold a record presumably


[22-Apr-20 04:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Right now if you show your driverrs licence to a traffic cop, it reveals all detail on that licence. With attestations you could (for example) show the attestation that you own a valid license


[22-Apr-20 04:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> No, that's not needed. If they verify your identity, they send the attestation to your ID. They don't need to keep everything.


[22-Apr-20 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> true


[22-Apr-20 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Because I live abroad, I need to supply proof of life very year, in order to receive my income. There is the requirement that it needs to be signed and stamped by local officials. They don't keep a record of that Proof-of-life document, they verify my ID and sign it. I produce it to get paid.


[22-Apr-20 04:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Similar to that


[22-Apr-20 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> although realistically they would hold that data, perhaps merely to comply with regulations


[22-Apr-20 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> i mean why wouldnt they? unless a data privacy law prevented them


[22-Apr-20 04:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> The authorities supplying the attestation will have your details, even if they don't supply an attestation... DMV has your details about your drivers license. IRS has your tax number.


[22-Apr-20 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> But now you can show certain data when requested, without sharing the data that is not needed.


[22-Apr-20 04:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> In the case of CoVid-19: The entity that tested you will have your results on file with your full data. If they attest that you have a certain Covid-19 status, you can show that without supplying any personal information


[22-Apr-20 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> So a tracing app can detect that you have been in contact with somebody that is tested positive and alert you.


[22-Apr-20 04:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> interesting


[22-Apr-20 04:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Without revealing your personal data, but also without knowing the personal data of the infected person


[22-Apr-20 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <gigamesh> hmm, an attestation is a bit like an oracle üôÇ


[22-Apr-20 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> compare it to storing a bunch of private z-addresses, 1 unique address for every person you encounter. The app can send a notification from a private z-address to the all the z-addresses you've been in contact with that the holder of this address is infected and they should get tested.


[22-Apr-20 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdvrsc] <Dinsey> Fantastic meeting and great speakers. Hoping this idea is up and running. I know a lot of people who are very suspicious of government tracking app. And this idea might not only convince them to do their part to help contain this virus,  but also introduce them to the sheer potential of crypto (beyond the moon,  lambo and price conversations!). If and when this is available for the general public at large (in Aus)  I'll do my part to spread adoption. Cheers

@Dinsey China already has a tracking app, but we can do better


[22-Apr-20 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Dinsey> It's certainly the way forward. But I suppose you need some level of government involvement for the attestations part. Not sure how easy that will be,  unless Google/Apple pave the way and Verus solution piggy backs that (from procedural point of view)

[dscrdvrsc] <GGG> Altsbit screwed anyone else? lost half of my VRSC and now that i withdraw everything left, they said everything was sent but it never made it to my wallet. All they said "Sorry, but it was sent from our local Verus desktop wallet". some of these exchanges really suck

[dscrdvrsc] <GGG> thats almost 600 vrsc down the drain ):

[24-Apr-20 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> If it shows on the chain the transfer is made. Is your wallet fully synchronized and on 982681?


[24-Apr-20 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GGG> its an exhange wallet


[24-Apr-20 09:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Then I recommend submitting a ticket to the exchange with the TXID included.


[24-Apr-20 09:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GGG> i already did


[24-Apr-20 10:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <bishop> I'll never understand why people withdrawal directly from one exchange to another one without first hitting your local wallet

[24-Apr-20 10:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <GGG> @bishop going from an exchange to a wallet to a exchange there is more fees that way....

[dscrdvrsc] <Mining Spec> True but its nothing at 0.00010000

[24-Apr-20 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Iroma> like is there a good way to report that kind of thing?


[24-Apr-20 05:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Cragorn> @Iroma You can report to Discord, but you can also send Oink a DM with a screenshot and preferably also copy and send the ID of the sender. That helps him find the account so he can kick and ban it. That is usually a lot quicker than Discord. He bans most of the DM bots that come in here, but he has to sleep once in a while too.

We can't afford to wait while our government continues to call essential workers "illegal" and will use "contact tracing" to arrest and deport them. In a pandemic, we are strong as the weakest link and must take care of EVERYONE.

What is high assurance? ‚Äì Free & Fair
The most critical software and hardware systems go beyond evaluation and certification to provide guarantees and mathematical evidence that they will function exactly as intended at all times.

[dscrdvrsc] <lost> Is this something that verusID could provide?


[27-Apr-20 11:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <ùôäùôûùô£ùô†> Deentralized by default, I would categorize Verus already in the high assurance category. I can't say which parameters need to be met to qualify as *high assurance* system (nor do I know if any official standard exists), but since voting is one of the goals in our vision Paper, Verus and by extensions VerusID would in my opinion definitely be something that fits in there and bring great benefits to that project.

We can't afford to wait while our government continues to call essential workers "illegal" and will use "contact tracing" to arrest and deport them. In a pandemic, we are strong as the weakest link and must take care of EVERYONE.

[dscrdvrsc] <Osjux> Hi, I'm new to cryptomining. How can i get started? Is there any good guide out there or something? (I'm asking here because i feel that if i search in the internet on how to get started i could get scammed or something, and i was told that this was a very good community)


[28-Apr-20 10:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdvrsc] <Godballz> Yes, this is def a good place to start. üëç 
Better to ask in #mining or #community-support if you have questions. There's lots of relevant information for what you're looking for in the pinned section for each channel. @Osjux

[dscrdvrsc] <Redman> @gigamesh no worries, always on the hunt for articles and possible exposure to audiences in Australia. There is a blockchain group both of the article writers are apart of. With the australian government announcing a roadmap for blockchain innovation in feb this year, Verus could very well get a lot of exposure if someone is to use it for that purpose.

Hi all. I have used the Agama desktop wallet for some time. I got a new computer and was in the process of re-installing the Agama wallet (I had version 0.6.1)  with the intension of importing my private keys (Pirate arrr) into the wallet like I had done in the past. When I went to download the Agama wallet from the Komodo website, I did not exactly see the same Agama wallet. I downloaded and synced the Verus wallet (Verus Agama right?) and the new Verus  wallet looks different. I don't see a tab that allows me to import my funds with my private keys. Any ideas? Is there a separate Agama wallet like before? What am I missing? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks

Hi, a noob question, what is the relationship between Verus and Komodo? Verus is a Komodo side chain? Verus have their own nodes? Komodo / Supernet invest in Verus?


[18-Oct-20 03:02 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Verus is originally a fork of kmd I believe. Supernet is a vrsc whale.

Verus is an independent chain and not a side chain of Komodo. They used komodo fork as their base. Komodo doesn't have any side chains.

Hi, 
We've added Verus (VRSC) to http://zpool.ca/algo/verus. See below for connection details.

Fee only: 0.5% or less
BTC payouts are processed once a day for balances above 0.0025
Payouts for all other currencies are made automatically every 4 hours for balances above 0.05 and balances more than 0.0125 are included in one of the payouts each day.

- Sample configurations -
To mine and get paid in VRSC:
```-a verus -o stratum+tcp://verus.mine.zpool.ca:6143 -u VRSC_ADDRESS -p c=VRSC,zap=VRSC``` 
Exchange to BTC:
```-a verus -o stratum+tcp://verus.mine.zpool.ca:6143 -u BTC_ADDRESS -p c=BTC```
Exchange to BTC but mine only VRSC:
```-a verus -o stratum+tcp://verus.mine.zpool.ca:6143 -u BTC_ADDRESS -p c=BTC,zap=VRSC```

All of our ports are NiceHash friendly, no need to specify any extra details
