What is the benefit of Antera to KMD holders? The blog post says that Antara chains are independent of the Komodo chain and KMD coin. So how is this related to Komodo ?

I see a lot of questions about if KMD doesnt charge any KMD for usage of its platform “why should anybody hodl KMD”. Implicit in the…


[28-Jun-19 10:04 AM] Zee 🎮👉🤑#6672
@jl777c would you mind being a little bit more transparent with your response rather than just providing a link? Based on your article I can assume you are under the premise that it is KMD's inherent interoperability that gives it value within the ecosystem. This ultimately creates a "spider web" effect of value as the ecosystem grows larger?

Few other notes and clarifications about information that we have already shared.

 - The much waited rebrand is going live on July 15th together with the Antara Framework launch.
 - Antara is a framework used to develop customizeable and purpose-built Smart Chains
 - 'Chain Lizard' was an codename for the blockchain generator app. The branded name is "Antara Composer" (Antara Smart Chain Composer)
 - Antara Composer app is used to launch new Smart Chains on AWS infastructure within a minute (new product)
 - AtomicDEX is a multi-coin wallet with atomic swap support. It is currently in closed beta & heavy testing. (new product)

P.S. Remember to upvote ⬆ questions that you think should get an answer. We haven't received tons of questions yet but incase we do those upvotes will help us pick the most requested ones.

Here's a list of rebrand related articles we have recently published. They will help anyone get up to speed about Komodo.

Antara & Rebrand AMA
Antara Framework & Rebrand AMA July 2nd, 2019    Komodo is an open, modular multi-chain platform with blockchain development roots going back to 2014. Since Komodo is a fork of Zcash, it started its journey as a privacy-oriented project, but has since expanded far beyond that...

As for weaknesses, that's a great question. I'd say our biggest weakness is extreme decentralization! Which might sound crazy. But we have a globally distributed team, with people on 4 different continents, so it's tough to coordinate meeting times and stay in step with each other

Roadmap:  yes there are details to be revealed at & after rebrand.
Past roadmaps: Komodo did not exist during NXT, sure a lot of the technology was planned in those days, which culminated in komodo platform v1.   Basilik mode is a tech question to ask in a dev channel.  I'm not familiar with it.

our technology offerings are very wide and that creates few challagnes for us, 1) our tech is little harder to understand, 2) we will have to rely on partners to build industry specific solutions (thus the partner network).

I think of it like this: Komodo is building a 'horizontal' platform and others have to come and build 'vertical' platforms that reach the end customers/use cases.

A few other reasons to hold KMD:

-- you get to participate in the annual Notary Node election, which allows KMD holders to vote for and choose 32 new operators

-- KMD is the primary trading pair for every other listed asset on the upcoming DEX

How would Komodo describe current state of blockchain


[02-Jul-19 10:28 AM] Mylo#8306
KMD has always been a currency within the ecosystem, for ecosystem services.   These services have and are being built out continually.  Currently dPoW, liquidity between assets in the dexfee market.   In the future, the antara modules will be able to utilize kmd for the sidechains that will be created for some features.   At the moment half a dozen building block modules have been built. 
With the ability to add sidechains with purpose built functionality on top of these building blocks (like a token system, gateways to 3rd party chains so they can get tech upgrades by tokenizing onto a kmd sidechain....& any future building blocks). 
There are currently 255 slots for building blocks.   When we need more building blocks, we can add more slots when that time comes.

@susmech "How would Komodo describe current state of blockchain"

Good question, we wrote an entire blog post about it some time ago: https://komodoplatform.com/the-promise-challenges-and-evolution-of-the-blockchain-industry/

As a summary, I think most projects are "technology followers" who take what the industry currently perceives as the best technology. They cut and pase an incrementally better solution together as their solution rather than look at the fundamentals and come up with new innovations that could revolutionize the industry.

[02-Jul-19 10:43 AM] Mylo#8306
@acidbird hiring process is HR related.   i'm not in HR, however this is how i've seen komodo work with new hires:
 - we will always be ready to collaborate with talented devs with enthusiasm, drive & an exceptional history.   we cannot turn back great devs.   some devs and other techs have approached, and then find their own niche - sometimes it's in kmd, sometimes it's in a related project.  there are dozens of related projects with finite timelines.   and then these devs/techs move onto some other project.   then they drop in & out to fill some technology requirement.
 - when an advert is posted, there is a need to fill a gap for a longer term & hone the skills of the new hire to specific tech or specific new tech usually.   there is a focus on not creating technical debt.  technical debt is not a sustainable way to run a project like kmd, from a HR perspective.
