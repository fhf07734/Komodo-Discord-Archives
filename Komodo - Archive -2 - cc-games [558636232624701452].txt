[22-Mar-19 06:01 AM] jl777c#5810
right now there is just two rpc calls, rng and rngnext


[22-Mar-19 06:04 AM] jl777c#5810
rng is passed in a blockhash and playerid (defaults to 0, max 254) and it returns the initial rng value (and last)
you can then call rngnext with the prior rng, up to maxrng times

 }
 
 The idea is for a game to start with a near future blockhash, so the lobby gets players signed up until just prior to the designated height. then that blockhash can be used to create a stream of rngs.
 
 the same initial rng can be used for all players, if the identical starting condition is required. up to 255 different initial rng can be derived from a single blockhash. (Actually any number is possible, for simplicity rng rpc limits to 255).
 
 you will notice maxrngs and lastrng, the lastrng is the rng value that will happen after maxrng iterations of calling rngnext with the current rng. This allows making time based multiplayer games where all the nodes can validate all the other nodes rng, even without realtime synchronization of all user input events.
 
 Every time period, all players would set their rng value to the lastrng value. The only thing to be careful of is it not exceed the maxrng calls to rngnext in a single time period. otherwise the same set of rng numbers will be repeated.

im confused here


[22-Mar-19 06:54 AM] siu#3920
so this is like a multiplayer rogue? im not understanding this.


[22-Mar-19 06:54 AM] jl777c#5810
?


[22-Mar-19 06:54 AM] jl777c#5810
it is just generating a deterministic set of rng


[22-Mar-19 06:54 AM] jl777c#5810
no game


[22-Mar-19 06:55 AM] jl777c#5810
most all games need rng


[22-Mar-19 06:55 AM] siu#3920
oh ok


[22-Mar-19 06:55 AM] siu#3920
so this is like a backend for building games


[22-Mar-19 06:55 AM] jl777c#5810
unless you are a gamedev, likely this will be too complex to understand


[22-Mar-19 06:55 AM] siu#3920
yeah, ok.


[22-Mar-19 06:56 AM] siu#3920
but good to know this exists


[22-Mar-19 06:56 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, abstracting the rogue techniques to generalize it so other games can be plugged into the same type of blockchaining

@Alright i got low level messages working, so now in realtime users will be committing to keystrokes prior to the keystrokes tx and in order to complete a bailout tx would need to get both confirmation from other nodes that they did commit to the keystrokes in realtime and also if anybody catches the bogus keystrokes, they can claim the bailout amount. dont have that logic yet, but that is the concept I am working toward


[22-Mar-19 02:33 PM] jl777c#5810
so some payment for attestors who attest that the keystrokes tx were realtime broadcast ahead of time and the ability for any contradictory keystroke to allow the claimant to get the gold/playerdata


[22-Mar-19 02:34 PM] jl777c#5810
once this works, no more keystrokes reorging (or even suppressing) as it will be timestamped and only allow for some small delay


[22-Mar-19 02:35 PM] Alright#0419
What do you mean by low level messages? A separate p2p network essentially?


[22-Mar-19 02:36 PM] jl777c#5810
no, i created a new p2p message the bitcoin protocol was doing called "events"


[22-Mar-19 02:36 PM] jl777c#5810
so it sends to 4 to 8 random peers


[22-Mar-19 02:36 PM] Alright#0419
Aha that is interesting 😀


[22-Mar-19 02:37 PM] Alright#0419
blockchain is a game server


[22-Mar-19 02:37 PM] jl777c#5810
doing this inside gamescc to get it working in isolation, maybe it will create a plug-in enabled interface that rogue dapp plugs into


[22-Mar-19 02:37 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, the blockchain as game server, lag is not bad on small networks

[22-Mar-19 02:38 PM] jl777c#5810
and even if it is 10 seconds, it is plenty fast for the purposes of validating pre-keystrokes tx events and to claim false keystrokes tx


[22-Mar-19 02:38 PM] Alright#0419
I want to explore 1 time use game chains. I think this would be perfect for them


[22-Mar-19 02:38 PM] Alright#0419
the ac_import=GATEWAY chain with block reward idea


[22-Mar-19 02:39 PM] Alright#0419
as soon as you transfer coins to it, you're immediately competing against everyone else who has coins on it for the block reward


[22-Mar-19 02:40 PM] jl777c#5810
so it is a sidechain, funded with external coins and gameplay wins coins?


[22-Mar-19 02:41 PM] Alright#0419
Ah I explained it once before. It's a bit strange to explain. Basically, you'd deposit some KMD to the gateway, receive some of the temporary coin in return. The chain itself would emit additional coins. When you go to withdraw, the exchange rate to KMD would be based on how many coins were emitted while you had coins on it


[22-Mar-19 02:42 PM] Alright#0419
So like if 2 people deposit 10 KMD each and the chain is emitting 1 coin per minute, 10 minutes later there is 30 of the gateway chain, but only 20 real KMD that can be withdrawed


[22-Mar-19 02:42 PM] Alright#0419
you would be competing with the other person for these 10 coins


[22-Mar-19 02:43 PM] Alright#0419
and the exchange rate would be 2/3


[22-Mar-19 02:43 PM] Alright#0419
when you go back to KMD


[22-Mar-19 02:43 PM] jl777c#5810
automated and variable exchange rate, so it starts worth 1:1 but it gets diluated based on chain emission


[22-Mar-19 02:43 PM] Alright#0419
yes


[22-Mar-19 02:43 PM] jl777c#5810
this would be a way to denominate gameplay in external currency


[22-Mar-19 02:44 PM] jl777c#5810
post your buyins, then based on ingame performance you split up the buyins


[22-Mar-19 02:44 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a gateway


[22-Mar-19 03:13 PM] Alright#0419
The objective in that example would be to earn >5 of the coins emitted. The nodes running the gateway could be the one doing these keystrokes checks


[22-Mar-19 03:14 PM] Alright#0419
I imagine doing 10 players would be about the same amount of work as doing 2


[22-Mar-19 03:14 PM] Alright#0419
the gateway itself could run it as a business, take some %


[22-Mar-19 03:15 PM] jl777c#5810
I think for the attestation it could be a small number of special nodes, but for the disputing a keystrokes, that should be fully decentralized


[22-Mar-19 03:16 PM] jl777c#5810
we just need to know that the keystrokes were being posted in realtime from the attestors


[22-Mar-19 03:16 PM] Alright#0419
Ah lol that just clicked


[22-Mar-19 03:16 PM] jl777c#5810
but all the nodes would need to validate what the attestors attest to, and the only way to do that trustlessly is if all nodes get the events


[22-Mar-19 03:18 PM] Alright#0419
hmmm, attestors could simply attest that they were submitting any keystrokes at all maybe? If all attestors say "this node didn't play this game in realtime" is that not enough?


[22-Mar-19 03:18 PM] Alright#0419
I guess it comes down to how attestors are selected


[22-Mar-19 03:19 PM] Alright#0419
i'm confusing myself, need to sleep on it 💤


[22-Mar-19 03:20 PM] jl777c#5810
does the network trust the attestors?


[22-Mar-19 03:20 PM] jl777c#5810
really it should be something all nodes already know, just a few need to be part of the final tx to attest to it


[22-Mar-19 03:57 PM] jl777c#5810
they arent segregated


[22-Mar-19 03:57 PM] jl777c#5810
actually they will be integrated into the transactions


[22-Mar-19 03:58 PM] jl777c#5810
the issue is making sure user events are fully reported and without errors, if those two things are validated by the network, then it seems cheating is simply not possible


[22-Mar-19 03:58 PM] jl777c#5810
using the "entire user events are replayed by the game engine" to determine the results method


[22-Mar-19 03:59 PM] jl777c#5810
and once cheating is not possible, then we can have money tournaments and know the winner won it with real gameplay (human or bot)

@TonyL its working much better. I was able to play a game after registering and then replaying it


[26-Mar-19 11:13 AM] jl777c#5810
next step is to get a deterministic result and since there is no playerdata, maybe at that point it is close to done


[26-Mar-19 11:14 AM] jl777c#5810
it is sending out each keystroke to the network, though that data isnt being used much yet


[26-Mar-19 11:15 AM] jl777c#5810
the codebase is much simplified, so by handling game specific things like playerdata all that is needed is the changing of the rng to support a new game

it just worked?


[26-Mar-19 02:37 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, it seems so 😃


[26-Mar-19 02:37 PM] TonyL#3577
`and is 1500 points a good game, no idea how to calibrate the payout` - 1500 it's not very hard actually


[26-Mar-19 02:37 PM] jl777c#5810
no validation yet, but good to know bailout worked. I wonder if multiplayer works


[26-Mar-19 02:37 PM] TonyL#3577
Like a 3-4 minutes game


[26-Mar-19 02:38 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so payout might be ok


[26-Mar-19 02:38 PM] TonyL#3577
balance: 0.06309999


[26-Mar-19 02:38 PM] TonyL#3577
Balance increased


[26-Mar-19 02:39 PM] jl777c#5810
lets get multiplayer sorted. the gamesCC code base is almost the same as rogue, i just removed all rogue specifics (or most of it even though data structures is still using rogue stuff)


[26-Mar-19 02:39 PM] jl777c#5810
and if you are running another node, you might see a bunch of messages


[26-Mar-19 02:39 PM] TonyL#3577
Is player who earned more points winner in multiplayer?


[26-Mar-19 02:39 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, I guess that is what we need to do, will think about how to figure that out


[26-Mar-19 02:40 PM] TonyL#3577
Ok, because not much sense in "who bailout last" system in tetris 😃


[26-Mar-19 02:40 PM] TonyL#3577
Building second node


[26-Mar-19 02:41 PM] TonyL#3577
Or better will make second rogue node first from bootstrap and test rogue multiplayer


[26-Mar-19 02:42 PM] TonyL#3577
And tetris multiplayer can test when will be points coparison multiplayer system for it


[26-Mar-19 02:42 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe rogue can use that system too?


[26-Mar-19 02:43 PM] jl777c#5810
otherwise an immortal can race to the amulet and back out to win


[26-Mar-19 02:43 PM] TonyL#3577
I think rogue needs two gameplay modes


[26-Mar-19 02:43 PM] TonyL#3577
If players wants to race on immortals - it's "collectioner mode"


[26-Mar-19 02:44 PM] TonyL#3577
If players wants something sportsman-like - it's "competition mode" and only fresh warriors are allowed (other words registration with playertxid not allowed)


[26-Mar-19 02:44 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, that is really easy to do


[26-Mar-19 02:44 PM] jl777c#5810
and it matches tetris, which has no playerdata


[26-Mar-19 02:46 PM] TonyL#3577
Some points/best gold result I've proposed before and it can be an interesting game mode as well


[26-Mar-19 02:46 PM] TonyL#3577
Also timelimited ones


[26-Mar-19 02:47 PM] TonyL#3577
And I think I can print in realtime all players extracts and timer


[26-Mar-19 02:47 PM] TonyL#3577
It should be dramatic 😃


[26-Mar-19 02:47 PM] TonyL#3577
After block X keystrokes just stops to accept to extract


[26-Mar-19 02:47 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, the baseline is working much better now


[26-Mar-19 02:49 PM] TonyL#3577
Let's say you can choose timelimit ( in blocks to make easy) on multiplayer game creation - after this block keystrokes stops to accept and bailout based on extracts executed


[26-Mar-19 02:49 PM] jl777c#5810
all such changes wont be that hard, but now that rogue and tetris are running mostly the same code, it feels needed to make a games plugin and have rogue and tetris plugin to the same games CC


[26-Mar-19 02:49 PM] TonyL#3577
Player who have most gold on extract - winner


[26-Mar-19 02:49 PM] jl777c#5810
all such variations of who wins can then be added once to the games CC and all the games inherit


[26-Mar-19 02:50 PM] TonyL#3577
Cool, #cc-games opening new horizons  😃

Going to rest - tomorrow will make separate tetris TUI (have to adopt few places and not show not needed ones)


[27-Mar-19 02:46 AM] jl777c#5810
I make makecclib to build all the .so files and dapps


[27-Mar-19 02:47 AM] jl777c#5810
I also added support in games CC to support a different game. much easier to do it at the source level, so you just need to make game.c game.h game.cpp and change 2 #ifdefs to use the game.c and game.cpp, so each .so will have one game with this method


[27-Mar-19 03:15 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL I moved the game source code into games dir


[27-Mar-19 03:15 AM] jl777c#5810
cc/makecclib should build all dapps and .so files


[27-Mar-19 03:16 AM] TonyL#3577
All dapps with rogue included?


[27-Mar-19 03:17 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

just the tetris and new games will be in games dir

yes, and new games CC games should go in games dir

fixed


[27-Mar-19 03:44 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm strange, used only makecclib in build.sh (and it built `tetris` dapp in cc/games)
But have rogue cclib

Hmm my tetris should contain fix - quite strange that it's 0 again

you need to make a script that copies the appropriate .so file to libcc.so and rebuild komodod

@jl777c Will do 👍


[27-Mar-19 09:51 AM] TonyL#3577
All TUIs using functions from same module `lib/tuilib.py` and also using `lib/logo.txt` as loading logo
Can I create some subfolder like a`tuilib` in `src/cc` or put these files to `src/cc` ?


[27-Mar-19 09:53 AM] TonyL#3577
In general this file just 91KB I can just create lib/tuilib.py inside each TUI folder - just will be harder to maintain


[27-Mar-19 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe it is better to make a komodo/src/tui folder with a subfolder for each variant and it can share tui/lib

Hmm interesting that before in game before `You finished with 9920 points on level 4.`
But now just 9400 on level 6 (level 6 means more lines I wonder).
Not sure how points calculating in game - maybe there is some bonus for combos

Aha, last keystroke zero baton issue (seems it's only issue we have so far) with print `FinalizeCCTx couldnt find 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`

I think I can fix it from TUI side - will just search zero baton ones in keystrokes.log and rebroadcast (if there are few - I'll just make delay between broadcasts 20 seconds)


[28-Mar-19 01:14 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm in this game not last one have zero baton in log but next-to-last


[28-Mar-19 01:19 PM] TonyL#3577
Was able to broadcast this next-to-last keystroke but progress wasn't added (because it's not in order I wonder)


[28-Mar-19 05:48 PM] TonyL#3577
Setup tetris games blaster on my node - it'll keep amount of pending singpleplayer games >= 100

Changed TUI a little bit also - for tetris it choosing random game from pending list now (same approach as sudoku).

Tetris games much shorter and more dynamic than rogue - so trying to cut waitings as much as possible.
So now it waiting 2 times: until registration tx is mined and next block before bailout execution

https://github.com/jl777/komodo/pull/1364
Also removed warriors choice possibility and for tetris forcing registration without playertxid argument

CC Games is like a framework for games connecting with blockchain (abstracted mechanics which was initially implemented in rogue). At the moment working game on it is Tetris - bricks falling, lines filling - depends of you score you getting coins on bailout

[13-Jul-19 12:54 PM] rainbro7#4735
It would be interesting to have a captcha like mechanism built into gameplay to prevent ai. If a simple game like Tetris is created, people can still cheat. Also, im sure there is something better than captcha that can be used. I see blockchain games with crypto integrations as a breeding ground for AI players :(
