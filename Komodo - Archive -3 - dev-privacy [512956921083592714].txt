Hi


[20-Nov-18 11:23 PM] plazma#1625
Advantages of jumbler plz üòú


[20-Nov-18 11:44 PM] Alright#0419
it makes all z -> t transactions fungible(exactly the same)


[20-Nov-18 11:45 PM] plazma#1625
Yea


[20-Nov-18 11:45 PM] plazma#1625
üòÄ


[20-Nov-18 11:54 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
technical:
t -> z, z -> z, z -> t
fixed amount ranging from 10, 100, 1000, 10000
on random time

result, anonymous untraceable coins in a public address.
how these public funds in t address are used is up to the user.

This behavior of anonymsing funds in transparent transactions is not possible with other zcash family projects.


[20-Nov-18 11:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if KMD is equally anonymous to Pirate, then the reason is Jumblr


[20-Nov-18 11:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
but only when it's usage is more. right now there aren't many doing jumbling


[20-Nov-18 11:58 PM] Alright#0419
you can obtain the same amount of privacy on any zkSNARKs coin if you're diligent about it


[20-Nov-18 11:58 PM] Alright#0419
what jumblr does is make it much harder to make a mistake


[20-Nov-18 11:59 PM] Alright#0419
it's *very* hard to be diligent about it btw

pirate makes it impossible to make a mistake üòõ

correct üëç


[24-Nov-18 07:23 AM] plazma#1625
jumblr is so cool...can we have a future implimentation where 10 inputs with same 10 komodo is jumbled to a sapling address and distributed between multiple sapling output z address so if someone puts funds at r address its origin is shows as mixed.....


[24-Nov-18 07:24 AM] plazma#1625
We can have the best mixer.....üòÄ

@ComputerGenie does EWBF's CUDA Zcash miner work with KMD directly or does it need tweaking?

that one works, the newer one does not

since that one is stable, he cut 200,9 entirely out of the new one

Hi,
Could someone please tell me what SC param I use to make a chain that has both `t` and `z` transactions?


[18-Aug-19 06:27 AM] CrisF#3405
I found `-ac_private=1` and `ac_public=1`.


[18-Aug-19 06:27 AM] CrisF#3405
Both of those?


[18-Aug-19 06:36 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
afaik, both are available by default

Cool, I'll give it a try.


[18-Aug-19 06:37 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
I never tried it, but it would seem to me that if you set both then all txes would be "outlawed" üòõ

I'll try with neither first.

we didnt discover it, zcash team did


[29-Sep-19 11:40 AM] sidhujag#3327
I wonder if that has farther reaching consequences because bitcoin recently added a new p2p mechanism to add random timing to hide who did tx and I doubt many of the zcash forks added that yet so you can trace down to who created a tx and where it‚Äôs relayed from and to

So duke didn‚Äôt find it and post on his journal?


[29-Sep-19 11:41 AM] jl777c#5810
zcash told us and there was a zcash security advisory.


[29-Sep-19 11:42 AM] jl777c#5810
after that, duke did post on his blog


[29-Sep-19 11:43 AM] jl777c#5810
as far as correlating transactions, zaddr tx are encrypted, so it is hard to correlate it to any specific zaddr, though it might be possible to use that information to add to an overall database of associations


[29-Sep-19 11:43 AM] sidhujag#3327
Yep

Erlay : efficient transaction relay in Bitcoin
Bitcoin is a top-ranked cryptocurrency that has experienced huge growth and survived numerous attacks. The protocols making up Bitcoin must therefore accommodate the growth of the network and ensure security. However, Bitcoin‚Äôs transaction dissemination protocol has mostly ...


[29-Sep-19 06:32 PM] jl777c#5810
erlay is very interesting


[29-Sep-19 06:46 PM] jl777c#5810
however it seems to be more about bandwidth efficiency than privacy...


[29-Sep-19 06:46 PM] jl777c#5810
```Timing attacks from public nodes. Erlay‚Äôs design is more robust to timing
attacks from private sybils [18, 29]. Robustness to timing attacks from public
nodes remains an open questions. Both BTCFlood and Erlay use faster relay to
public nodes and slower relay to private nodes. But Erlay‚Äôs slower reconciliation
could be abused by public nodes to more easily identify transactions originating
from private nodes. With higher node connectivity this attack becomes expensive,
but a general solution remains as future work.```


[29-Sep-19 06:47 PM] jl777c#5810
any attacker would use a public node, so erlay actually reduces privacy. if they are positioning erlay as a privacy enhancement that is not correct

Hi, could someone please tell me how much data can be sent in a Z-tx?  

I looked in `help |grep z_` and didn't see where/how the data would be sent.  I thought that there was a 'message' type of function but couldn't find anything.  How would the data be sent?


[05-Oct-19 04:54 AM] phm87#7395
Do you mean in the OP_RETURN of each tx ? (I don't know if it is present nor if it is in clear for z tx)
<https://komodod.com/t/71973b461ee94ba3cb8b2214529d103314114bebd42512b38847823ebaf6eff3>
I heard that messages are also possible in privacy coins such as HUSH (and maybe others) but I don't know if the message is public or private


[05-Oct-19 05:03 AM] CrisF#3405
Yes, I heard of private messaging too.  I don't know if it was an OP_RETURN though.
Oh, I saw something similar to this on a slide in a presentation today `jLLwÔøΩOÔøΩQ(ÔøΩÔøΩ:AKxÔøΩÔøΩt`

that should be an ETH transaction on photo above (metamask is ETH browser wallet)

512 bytes in ztx memo field


[05-Oct-19 05:17 AM] CrisF#3405
Yes, it's ETH @TonyL.  Called FLOW.  That guy was one of the cryptokitty guys.


[05-Oct-19 05:18 AM] TonyL#3577
just read some ETH docs - in ETH amout of data which you can put into "data" field limited only by block gaslimit


[05-Oct-19 05:18 AM] TonyL#3577
so maybe if you has enough ETH it's possible to rekt blocks by huge messages

Sorry for my confusion CrisF, I never played with signed msgs nor with op return data. I read that signed msgs don t require coins.
Maybe jl777 posted the solution: use the 512 bytes in ztx memo field


[05-Oct-19 05:22 AM] phm87#7395
Mmmhhhh maybe it was the memo field that was increased into Hush, I am not sure

Hi, I've been pushing through a few jobs and haven't gotten back to ‚òù yet.
Have a quick question re: `HEX`
The hex I used in the above example came out of an online HEX converter with spaces after every 2nd character.  I removed the spaces and seems the HEX was acceptable.
Just put a larger file through a converter.


[07-Oct-19 04:11 AM] CrisF#3405
Output is quite a massive amount (394305 Bytes) of return like this:```0xFF, 0xD8, 0xFF, 0xE0, 0x00,...```


[07-Oct-19 04:12 AM] CrisF#3405
Should I just remove the `,` and `spaces`, or is it acceptable in this format?


[07-Oct-19 04:29 AM] jl777c#5810
hex string should only have hex chars


[07-Oct-19 04:29 AM] jl777c#5810
0x is not part of the hex, neither is space, commas, or any other separators


[07-Oct-19 04:32 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok, thanks!
I'll have a look for another converter.


[07-Oct-19 04:35 AM] CrisF#3405
@jl777c is there a Hex converter built into Komodo / Iguana anywhere?  Maybe related to the steganography code?


[07-Oct-19 04:37 AM] jl777c#5810
iguana i think had a hex converter, but it is such a simple thing to do...

The question about komodo/iguana was related to the function already build into the code.  So someone who knew what they were doing could implement it.


[07-Oct-19 04:48 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
not sure what the windows version would be, but you can use:
`echo -n "Komodo"|xxd -pu`

the hex you would use is `ffd8ffe000`


[07-Oct-19 04:19 PM] CrisF#3405
Thanks, @gcharang. Did you get that using```for (i=0; i<len; i++)
                 printf("%02x",&ptr[i*2]);```?
The example `0xFF, 0xD8, 0xFF, 0xE0, 0x00,` is just the first part of a 394305 Byte jpg.


[07-Oct-19 07:11 PM] gcharang#6833
@CrisF no, I just removed "0x" and spaces, converted capital to small for the hex output you have posted
`0xFF, 0xD8, 0xFF, 0xE0, 0x00` is the same as `ffd8ffe000`

I assume the AtomicDEX uses same system for 24 word seeds


[22-Nov-19 10:08 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
no, they are totally different things (that's why pirate lite has its own wallet.dat file even)


[22-Nov-19 10:09 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
so now I need to move all 20+ coins to a new 24 word seed - for hacker resons alone I  suppose

I was researching zSPV


[22-Nov-19 10:10 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280

[22-Nov-19 10:10 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
hopefully


[22-Nov-19 10:13 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
so I "could" use same 24  word  seed but it would generate a different z address - from  pirate light to say future AtomicDEX

I guess so, it's hard to say what one could or could not do on a thing that isn't yet ü§∑üèΩ

Hello,
I've been thinking for a while about creating a privacy-oriented POS coin (z-snark, etc.). Being very interested in everything related to privacy, I would have liked to discuss with you about the possibility of creating such a project. The idea would be to create a full private POS coin under Komodo ecosystem.
According to my research, most privacy oriented POS coins have a public chain before you can anonymize the coins, a bit like Zcash or Xspec for example. Following several POW projects like PirateChain, Monero or Grin, it seems to me that such a project could find its place. The "easy to mine" and energy cost efficient side of Proof of Stake technology seems to be able to also bring a simpler and wider adoption in many continents such as Africa or South America for example.
For my part, I am a project manager evolving mainly in international solidarity and the strengthening of civil societies. You will understand through this short presentation that I am not as technical as most of the people here and try to see if other people with varied skills would show an interest in this idea.

Have a nice day.


[23-Jun-20 05:13 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Not sure how you can mine with POS when on a private chain


[23-Jun-20 05:13 AM] Cryptoon#3362
There is no way to prove to the network that you possess the coins you claim to stake, because anon.


[23-Jun-20 09:42 PM] Mylo#8306
yeah fully z pos doesn't seem likely to be do-able.
maybe make z->t possible, t->t impossible, and then use t for pos.  hybrid pos/pow for inclusivity (80/20)


[23-Jun-20 09:46 PM] Mylo#8306
it will need some dev to accomplish this customization


[29-Jun-20 02:25 AM] Brobrowniz#9013
Thank you for your feedbacks @Cryptoon & @Mylo.
What about doing nearly the same as PirateChain. With $arrr you have to mine before you can have/use your anon coin. This is the only way to see the coin in the network before it gets anon. 
I do not know if it could be possible but, could we imagine that a pos coin may need to maturate before becoming a pos-anon coin and get used, this way we could analyze the chain and avoid any abuses. 
I do not know if I am clear enough, if not I will try to explain more and better.


[29-Jun-20 04:43 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah but with PoW you can prove that you are pointing hash towards the chain in order to mine a block.


[29-Jun-20 04:44 AM] Cryptoon#3362
With PoS, you lock funds to prove you are staking the funds, so you will need to put the funds in a transparant address first.


[29-Jun-20 04:53 AM] Brobrowniz#9013
We are on the same page. But would it be possible?


[29-Jun-20 04:55 AM] Alright#0419
not sure it's possible without leaking amounts or some very complex math


[29-Jun-20 04:56 AM] Alright#0419
simplest way to do it would be to force z -> t -> z each time coins are used to staked, but it's leaks some data


[29-Jun-20 04:58 AM] Alright#0419
hard way would be to use proper zksnarks maths, but would require very in depth knowledge(think academia). This would also be like a "black box", ie hard for anyone else to verify

@Alright sound realy interesting to get a POS privacy by default coin , hard or easy way it can be done? what do you think ?


[07-Jul-20 12:52 PM] Animal#2514
@Cryptoon can you put the funds like a "pool"  , knowing only the ammount stake, but not on person?


[07-Jul-20 12:54 PM] Animal#2514
@Brobrowniz  Staking coins are the most search out there, everybody wants a share of the bag, pasive income on investment . How ROI should be ?


[07-Jul-20 12:55 PM] Animal#2514
@Oszy what do you think?


[07-Jul-20 12:56 PM] Animal#2514
sorry for the tag but this is a good ideea that i was question myself , why there is not a privacy coin pos?


[07-Jul-20 02:59 PM] Oszy#5734
i think it was explained a few posts above why it's not easy/possible without leaking data


[08-Jul-20 03:19 AM] Animal#2514
So POS on privacy remain a dream  üòÖ


[08-Jul-20 03:39 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Yes, unless you make sacrifices to stake on transparant adresses


[08-Jul-20 03:40 AM] Animal#2514
one day , somebody will find a solution üòÖ


[08-Jul-20 03:41 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But then you dont have 100% privacy and thus why bother


[24-Jul-20 04:42 AM] Alright#0419
@Animal it's not terribly complicated if you don't mind leaking some info(namely amounts which could be linked to IPs)


[21-Aug-20 12:31 AM] Brobrowniz#9013
Hi @Alright @Cryptoon @Oszy @Mylo @Animal,
I have been thinking about something to "solve" or at least brainstorm.
Since the supply has to be issued at genesis for a POS coin, what if all issued coins are directly "transformed" in anon-POS and then distributed?
That way we avoid the leaking of data we talked about in a sense.


[21-Aug-20 02:14 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But again, how will you prove to the chain you are staking coins on a z address?


[21-Aug-20 02:14 AM] Cryptoon#3362
you need to prove to your peers you are staking 1% of the supply to get adequate reward


[21-Aug-20 02:14 AM] Cryptoon#3362
but as coins are hidden, how can you prove it?


[21-Aug-20 04:33 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Cryptoon via zk-snarks


[21-Aug-20 04:33 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's not mathematically impossible to stake zaddr funds, I just haven't seen anybody come close to doing it yet


[21-Aug-20 04:33 AM] dukeleto#7326
some coins say they can, but they don't use zaddrs

i haven't looked at their code


[21-Aug-20 05:06 AM] Cryptoon#3362
yeah @Alright also already said it could be possible, but require some pretty deep maths


[21-Aug-20 09:48 AM] Brobrowniz#9013

@dukeleto#7326 I am also interested in xspec, they are running 2 chains.
1 public chain with $XSPEC and an anon chain with $SPECTRE. I guess we can find some data when you switch from public to anon chain and the opposite.

Peg POS coin to a zcoin - mine it/  jumble it/ and disburse in z via subatomics...right?? Where's the leak?


[12-Sep-20 08:37 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
Mining pool would probably  be a necessity...??? Just using imagination

When comparing it to other anonymous cryptosystems like Monero, Zcash, Lelantus, or Mimblewimble, we are able to notice additional scalability improvements.

If it's a hard peg you'd need to comply with KYC/AML somehow, and if it's a soft peg then you need to worry about keeping the price stable
