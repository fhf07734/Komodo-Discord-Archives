There was a request to create a dedicated channel for topis like regulations, tax issues, starting a business, entrepreneurship in blockchain, and things like that.


[04-Jun-19 04:23 AM] Audo#5667
In other words, a channel for all the people & teams who will help to build a Komodo ecosystem üòÉ


[04-Jun-19 04:26 AM] Mylo#8306
hi @Crabby Paddy channel got setup because of some business related questions - like company formations, residency, tax etc.

[04-Jun-19 06:15 AM] dukeleto#7326

[04-Jun-19 07:55 AM] eclips#1570
what's your way to cash out mining revenues (or crypto revenues in general) ?


[04-Jun-19 07:55 AM] eclips#1570
here, still use wirex


[04-Jun-19 08:25 AM] mrlynch#5735

coinbase is a necessary evil in my life. they deposit to my bank almost instantly now though, which is nice.

has anyone used bisq?


[04-Jun-19 12:05 PM] mrlynch#5735
care to elaborate?


[04-Jun-19 12:46 PM] mrlynch#5735
that's ok


[04-Jun-19 03:58 PM] allbits#5898
I've used bisq for a siafund/btc trade and I did not need any daemons running locally


[04-Jun-19 03:58 PM] allbits#5898
And it was smooth, worked as expected

@eclips what is your experience with wirex? I think they are expanding to the US soon

All of the sources are pretty much from the Komodo site or documentation, and it covers a condensed version of the history, how it works, the products, and some security / technical info. If anyone spots anything that‚Äôs missing / wrong / should be elaborated on / etc., I‚Äôd really appreciate it üò¨

@InfiniteSumLtd thanks for the write up, someone from the team will go through it, and get in touch with you
but it might take some time because we are all busy now
can you ping us a week later if we don't get back to you?

@InfiniteSumLtd yeah we'll have to go through card by card.   lots of updates in the next month which will make your site look outdated & team page is different to current.


[07-Jun-19 10:31 PM] Mylo#8306
plenty of info there, which is great - site didn't fully load , every 2nd card is blank.  vids are cool.


[07-Jun-19 10:39 PM] InfiniteSumLtd#9498
Thanks for taking a look @Mylo.  I figured we'd have to update things again with the new releases, so no worries there. I was just trying to make sure that the basic foundation is there, and that we weren't missing anything glaring.


[07-Jun-19 10:39 PM] InfiniteSumLtd#9498
The blank cards thing is a little weird though...they all load up on my end, so I'm not sure what the error might be.


[07-Jun-19 11:53 PM] Mylo#8306
Firefox maybe.  If you have flex in css it can be a bit weird


[07-Jun-19 11:56 PM] InfiniteSumLtd#9498
Yup. That's it. Just booted up firefox and I'm seeing the same thing.


[07-Jun-19 11:58 PM] InfiniteSumLtd#9498
It works in Brave, Chrome, and Safari, so I'll dive in this weekend to see if I can fix that.


[07-Jun-19 11:58 PM] InfiniteSumLtd#9498

Is there any resource that lists the strategic (or non-strategic) partnerships announced by Komodo?

I‚Äôd like to populate the Crypto Hedgehog KMD Business page with partners, and I know some of them have been announced on the blog...I was just hoping to find a definitive / exhaustive list to make sure I don‚Äôt miss any.


[10-Jun-19 06:54 PM] Mylo#8306
There‚Äôs a lot not covered.  They are all informal or formal.  They are generally not public because each dev, team member, notary node operates independently and not representative of solely kmd.

There is a formal kmd partner program in the works.

@metaphilibert as I suggested IRL to reduce your taxes in Be, if your company is less than 1 year old and if you were in phisical person before, you can do the goodwheel to reduce taxes of about 10%


[14-Jun-19 11:47 AM] metaphilibert#0926
Too late for me, had to do it 9 years ago lol


[14-Jun-19 11:48 AM] metaphilibert#0926
But indeed good advice


[14-Jun-19 11:48 AM] phm87#7395
If you have/own other companies in Europe, you can invoice your belgian company. Do not be too hard with amounts to avoid pbs


[14-Jun-19 11:49 AM] phm87#7395
International accountant in Europe is about 5k to 10k. Then 1k to 5k per year. I heard it is worth it (guy in fr who have companies in uk, lux ...)


[14-Jun-19 11:52 AM] phm87#7395
There are other tricks that are not forbidden yet (bc govt is slow) as example to play with physical person and company stuff (administrative work but we can gain few %).


[14-Jun-19 01:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
5k for an accountant per year what


[14-Jun-19 01:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I pay mine 2.5k total or so in BE. Management company so not that many outgoing/ingoing invoices. For the other ones that have something like 1k ingoing/outgoing docs I pay around 1000/month allin


[14-Jun-19 01:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Lots of optimisations possible in BE üòÉ


[14-Jun-19 01:29 PM] phm87#7395
In Be, I paid mine about 600-700‚Ç¨ per year when I was in physical person. Now that I have a company it should be 1.2k per year


[14-Jun-19 01:30 PM] phm87#7395

I work in Brussels as freelance but I signed with a luxemburgish company so we are doing autoregulation (no VAT on the bill and VAT is paid in Lux)


[14-Jun-19 01:31 PM] phm87#7395

Ah hmm livraison intracommunautaire?


[14-Jun-19 01:32 PM] phm87#7395
yeah somethings like this but for services


[14-Jun-19 01:32 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Protip: if you order stuff on coolblue, and enter your VAT details, you can get anything delivered without VAT


[14-Jun-19 01:33 PM] phm87#7395
yeah but I prefer to pay VAT then the state gives me back the money (I was in autoregulation during 2 years when I worked in Lux and paid taxes in Be)


[14-Jun-19 01:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
LIC is the legal term, doesnt matter what you sell services/goods/... just means you dont need to charge vat for sales cross borders

siu lives there, and puerto rico is a crypto paradise

my belgian accountant doesn't want to discuss about international stuff : only belgian law. But I think that in crypto-sphere, enhance this can be easier

I'm interested by the "crypto accountants in france"... Don't know where to start my searches. It seems that "fiscal services" don't know how to tax us too!


[14-Jun-19 02:14 PM] metaphilibert#0926
France seems to be hell for crypto startups as all the main banks are not allowing you to open accounts if you mention "blockchain" or "Cryptocurrency" in your business description
True fact


[14-Jun-19 02:14 PM] phm87#7395
establish crypto company in france with bank account is germany is fine

[14-Jun-19 02:17 PM] metaphilibert#0926

[14-Jun-19 02:23 PM] phm87#7395
apart from that, if I launch a hashrate trading place such as nicehashmafia or hashtap.ca (zpool that I love), how to tax this ?


[14-Jun-19 02:24 PM] phm87#7395
Income is coming from all around the world so due to global income, the company can choose its country and states are trying to attract with rulings


[14-Jun-19 02:24 PM] phm87#7395
and exceptions in laws


[14-Jun-19 02:25 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Not sure about all the specific aspects but it surely should worh a comparison


[14-Jun-19 02:26 PM] phm87#7395
US defined laws about mining and I think that other countries should follow


[14-Jun-19 02:26 PM] phm87#7395
US have a bigger army and a president that is more intelligent than other presidents united :troll:


[14-Jun-19 02:27 PM] phm87#7395
but in many cases, US decided and other countries follows


[14-Jun-19 02:27 PM] phm87#7395
what about VAT on crypto on mining in US ?


[14-Jun-19 02:27 PM] metaphilibert#0926
Don't know


[14-Jun-19 02:27 PM] phm87#7395
answer can change in each state of US I think


[14-Jun-19 02:28 PM] phm87#7395
maybe we should ask @ComputerGenie  about US taxes on mining/trading and such things

@Cryptoon  you're right about (logical) non appliance of VAT for your "intracommunautaire" invoices  (between EU countries) (for B2B only) -check article 21 Code TVA / article 44 Directive 2006/112/CE-
but afaik VAT infos are crossed between EU countries and using a VAT nr to buy goods in another country with a 21% discount (by not registering on your side) will be spotted and is fraud

@metaphilibert intracommunautaire listing which they use to check such things is only needed if you cross 100k in international invoices a year I believe. Without there isnt an efficient way to check this

Also in the company my partner has a family member working for the tax authority and just asked her if they checked for such things

i thought multinationals never have to pay any taxes via cleverly setup inter-company expenses/revenues


[15-Jun-19 01:00 AM] jl777c#5810
a) find 2 (or more) jurisdictions that allow for arbitrary fiscal years and taxes due based on annual profits


[15-Jun-19 01:00 AM] jl777c#5810
b) company in jurisdiction A has fiscal year ending Dec 31, in B it ends June 30th


[15-Jun-19 01:01 AM] jl777c#5810
c) during the first half of year, B has a lot of legitimate expenses that it pays to A, so A has a surplus at June 30th, B has no profits at the critical end of fiscal year


[15-Jun-19 01:02 AM] jl777c#5810
d) during the second half of the year, A has a lot of legitimate expenses that it pays to B, so B now has a surplus at Dec 31 and A has no profits at the critical end of fiscal year


[15-Jun-19 01:02 AM] jl777c#5810
e) repeat, moving ever larger amounts as profits compound taxfree


[15-Jun-19 01:03 AM] jl777c#5810
when i realized this is what the multinationals are doing, with full awareness of the govt, then i realized it is only the smaller companies that are funding basically the majority of tax burden


[15-Jun-19 01:04 AM] jl777c#5810
best is to pick A and B that have legitimate seasonal profitability, many retail companies have a lot of profits in Q4, so that is not to hard to find


[15-Jun-19 01:04 AM] jl777c#5810
and all this done properly is totally legal as they wrote the rules so that if you pay the accountant and laywer taxes, you dont have to pay actual taxes

I do that with my comps as they have different ends of their fiscal years


[15-Jun-19 02:25 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But the ‚Äòproblem‚Äô is when you want to take out profits is that you need to realize them one day in order to pay out dividends from your country


[15-Jun-19 02:25 AM] Cryptoon#3362
What the international companies do is setup a company that holds the trademarks in a low tax country


[15-Jun-19 02:25 AM] jl777c#5810
with proper types of companies, virtually all things can become a company expense, cant it?


[15-Jun-19 02:26 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And the other entities in high tax countries pay to use the trademarks to the low tax entity


[15-Jun-19 02:26 AM] jl777c#5810
it is all just a big joke, the companies with the funds to pay the right accountants end up with 2.4% tax rate, the others at 48%

yes, so pay the 2% tax, all problems solved


[15-Jun-19 02:27 AM] jl777c#5810
the tax rate for a properly structured multinational is whatever the lowest tax rate that exists in the world

[15-Jun-19 02:28 AM] jl777c#5810
it is just a big waste of time and productivity to prevent excessive taxation. more efficient to spend time and money on productive things, but it you dont do it, you get screwed really bad, so seems not much choice but to play the game

Most of the bel20 companies have a fiscal ruling (some are below 500 employees). I will begin an excel sheet.
I agree with Cryptoon : we should ask a ruling. But for now, I prefer to learn existing rules about other countries


[15-Jun-19 03:44 AM] phm87#7395
I saw small companies with as much optimizations as big ones (they played with their friends companies instead of creating new ones). Who owns the company, who is employee and have right to unemployment benefits as example

[15-Jun-19 04:41 AM] mrlynch#5735
just want to mention my recent experiences
UK is a crypto friendly country - i was looking for months for a proper setup and didn't see the trees for the forest

1. main banks are crypto friendly (barclays actually welcome crypto businesses as they are building their own blockchain)
2. company formation is cheap (aprox ¬£150 with all the bells and whistles; cheapest i saw was around ¬£40) and you don't have to be a resident
3. gov has passed **some** crypto tax regulation but they left it at a case by case basis basically meaning don't be a dickhead and pay **some** tax - hmrc (irs equivalent) is more than helpful with info - long term hodlers pay 0% tax, traders need to qualify under what they call "badges of trade" and pay cgt (capital gains tax - 20% of profits), trust funds are possible to alleviate %
4. corporation tax is 19% but there are loads of deductibles
5. london is one of the most respected financial centers
6. if brexit happens, regulations are more likely to be even more relaxed - brits in general like privacy, but had to go by eu laws & regulations (aml, etc)
7. plenty of crypto accountants & lawyers offering their services which lets u focus on actually running your business and they deal with all the tax non-sense

@phm87 btw I would never ask for a ruling directly myself, but let a lawyer be an intermediary at first to see what is possible. Otherwise if the ruling is denied they know who you are and what you have. But if done by a lawyer on your behalf, the lawyer can ask it hypothetically and not divulge personal information because client confidentiality.

I have found in shopping for visa's its more important to consider their visa treaties, and taxation secondarily. Once you are outside USA tax jurisdiction - ie have renounced your citizenship - numerous (legal) tax avoidance options become available. Besides - even retaining us citizenship the right foundations and trusts can shield 100% of tax liability


[26-Jun-19 10:26 AM] G888#0307
visa treaties - for those not familiar - are more important for non-eu countries, like carribean islands. St Kitts for example has strong visa treaties (travel rights with other nations)

Serious question - Other than store of value [Bitcoin] ... is there any other single usecase which has mass adoption in last 10 years?

Even who understands crypto .. I don't find a well enough blockchain use case out side of finance


[08-Jul-19 03:56 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
blockchains are good at creating asset and financial instruments,,, after store of value.. we will see a wave of products providing lending support and I think it will get adopted well too


[08-Jul-19 03:57 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
Payments is good usecase and I think stable coins and libra will drive that

That is another major use case of crypto in the past ten years.  Open timestamp (Bitcoin), supplychain tracking(Vaultchain),  Deeds and titles(Factom),  Cybersecurity (Komodo).  Taken in aggregate , millions of users affected by this use case


[08-Jul-19 04:39 PM] allbits#5898
Also storage (Sia) and id for use in decentralized applications (blockstack). These are actual use cases since I personally use them for real world stuff.

these happy small businesses, which are selling emotions by practicing their management philosophy that people should be better off, and society should be better, are expected to give us a lot of implications today. Looking at the aspects of small and medium-sized companies that place the value of a company in the happiness of its members and its perpetuation, there is hope that they will realize what the essence of the company is and find some answers.

`FinCEN doesn't matter here, IRS matters`
True, but what I'm saying is that the IRS's official stance is that the FinCEN doc is their basis and as such if FinCEN says it doesn't apply then the IRS can't say that it does if the IRS says that FinCEN is their guide (logically at least)


[12-Jul-19 06:29 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
From the IRS:``` For a more comprehensive description of convertible virtual currencies to date, see Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) Guidance on the Application of FinCEN‚Äôs Regulations to Persons Administering, Exchanging, or Using Virtual Currencies (FIN-2013-G001, March 18, 2013).  ```

Any suggestions on how to monetise a site without compromising on privacy?

Do you know of any forms of ethical advertising/affiliates where people are not tracked with cookies across the web? 
I read that it's possible...in the sense that if they buy something from a totally unique link given to you, that's what tells the seller the buyer comes from you.

 The other common method is more effective, they usually use an ID that is in a cookie and it tracks visitors, but I don't want to use it - the whole site is focused on Privacy tech so it wouldn't be right.

My other idea is to integrate a form of crypto exchange, maybe something like what sideshift.ai offer to their partners

Would like to also make a utility coin with optional Z-addresses that members can use to pay for premium listings/special features and receive a discount if they use it.


[31-Jul-19 12:29 AM] hyperDEX#6586
optional privacy is basically no privacy at all

you would need something like ARRR


[31-Jul-19 12:40 AM] jl777c#5810

going zaddr only means you cant really do anything else that transactions and store of value

PIRATE is the ultimate in privacy, but that is the only thing it can do

maybe in the landscape of thousands of coins that cant do anything else either, PIRATE is their equal in functionality, but the next wave of alt season we will see many alts with enhanced capabilities and the vanilla forks that are not already firmly established wont have any chance


[31-Jul-19 01:12 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
Yes that's what I thought and why I suggested making a z-optional coin if I do create one to go with the website.

About AtomicDEX, it says this on the site (bottom of the homepage, under "Partner with Us"):
"integrate atomic swaps and let your users trade right from your app"


[31-Jul-19 01:15 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
is that just for mobile apps, or could a website also integrate it?

But from what I understand, there shouldn't be any link between the two, Google doesn't get any data from Chrome just because they are using the Chromium code.
I think technically by default Brave is the best for privacy (no telemetry, while Firefox has that). But if you understand the settings you can make Firefox super-private

@D2D privacyalternatives.com but if you are using Chromium base you are also supporting chromium development hence you are supporting Google. Like you said you can make ff very secure and remove telemetry if you want. So why did brave now do that? Because a personal issue whit ff? Idk it's hard to find the perfect solution. I just want to not use Google related products that's why I'm using Firefox. (while sitting here using Android, fuck me right!)

@Deleted User can you point me to a place where I can read and understand why Firefox is bad architecture compared to chromium. In my mind the solution is not all browser is based on chromium. And that why Firefox is needed for the space.


[01-Aug-19 06:02 AM] hastrup#8742
@Deleted User well that is not very promising for the future of browsers and free net. Thx for the insight!


[01-Aug-19 10:18 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
Another thing is that not too long ago Firefox had a bug that suddenly deactivated thousands of addons. And these extra plugins are used for everything now, even as VPNs...so that was quite bad. And when I use Firefox  on Mac it's quite heavy for it and the fans start hyperventilating

"Why not use the Blockchain and Cryptocurrency?
We're excited about about the new possibilities these technologies are creating, and we'd love to explore how they could help us achieve our goals. But just like we won't wait for self-driving cars to become ubiquitous before calling a Lyft, we're very practical about using existing services to solve problems right now. We can already get pretty far using well-established technologies already integrated with global systems. That said, we are actively exploring how to support cryptocurrency on the platform, so if you're interested in that, get in in touch."

With the boom of mini-stakers (distributed PoS), KMD could notarize to LUMBER and send the 10-50 BTC it would otherwise have burned in the old model, directly to LUMBER to fund further development and industry adoption (network effect for KMD).

Is anyone interested in working on a games project? I have a mostly finished game in C# and was looking for either a UI/UX person, or someone that could help finish the game. I sunk some money into dev, artwork, etc but never finished it off - if you are ok working for game ownership % that would be sick. I have a partner that's got 12 years of dev but no game dev experience, and I'm more on the business strategy/marketing side of things.

I started adding some products/articles for a new Shop on my website and I'm using affiliates (referral links) at the moment. They are ITP (Intelligent Tracking Protection) compliant, so they use only first party cookies (not the third party cookies that follow you around showing you the same ads everywhere).

 But I would prefer to sell my own products, also because the profits on referrals are very low, especially for a niche site on privacy. So if there are any logos/designs from the Komodo ecosystem that I can use to design some t-shirts etc please let me know. I found some affiliates for Hush clothing, Monero, Grin, Zcash...but the ones I found for Komodo are still using the old logo

Do you think creating a dedicated coin could have a place on the Privacy Alternatives website?
To keep things simple, it wouldn't even need to have privacy features as there are already some great privacy-focused coins around. Thinking of creating an ERC20 token to try it, using Metamask etc, then maybe later I can move it to the Komodo blockchain

Yes GAS is a problem I know, but Ethereum have the infrastructure to do it easily with Metamask and other tools and wallets available. I registered with the composer and the complete price was more than $8k. Not saying it's an unfair price , you get a lot for that amount,  being on AtomicDEX, having the security of dPoW etc, but I can't spend that amount at the moment. 

I also want to research what I would need to do for anything  related to regulations/compliance if:

1) I create a coin and then put it on any exchanges

2) If I integrate an exchange like Sideshift (and even AtomicDEX I think offer integrations).

Planning to move to a crypto friendly country very soon, probably Georgia, to make this possible

This is why the IMF wants to stop you from using cash
A theory gaining traction is that the real motive for the cash ban is not the so-called black economy, but to give authorities greater control during recessions.

"The final two challenges facing all stablecoins (most of which haven‚Äôt launched yet) are scalability and privacy. Global digital cash must be fast, cheap, and private. That can only occur if the platform it is built upon can scale. It must also be private, for both philosophical and practical reasons. A decentralized stablecoin could never serve as global, digital cash without some guarantee of privacy."

[26-Sep-19 11:22 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
I think a browser is one of the best things for mass adoption. And as Brave has a wallet for certain cryptos, a fork could have its own coins like, KMD etc. Then I don't know how it works for regulations, if they would be forced to do KYC like Brave.
They say it's to prevent fraud. And it's true that if you have a system of rewards many people will try to cheat, but there are better and safer ways to verify without people giving their real name, documents etc

i couldn't find a proper category for this but this is our project and wanted to share it. we would like to get funded and complete it if community approves and loves project.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/11x7gpfeDEnUEgnc4uPgVH0Ka3XtPHuYfTB2XDWYgWwc/edit?usp=sharing

here is our demo for "Bitrophone" project. Due to lack of sources we couldn't enable/create some features & get cloud servers, mail servers & licensing protocols for song uploads and payment screen... If we get funded for project we will use funding to get them and upgrade the website in future. But i think we created a cool thing as a demo version in less then a month with just 2 people. Also our admin panel, which you won't be able to see in this demo is almost ready. I wanted to mail you with a demo, now at least we got something to show & upgrade. We are still at %20 completion of being %100 ready for service.

https://sabrikas.com/bitrophone/ 
demo username: demo@bitrophone.com
demo password: 123456


In this demo you can see how will our music distribution service work, 
song upload panels(disabled uploads but works on backend. we don't have cloud :D), 
payment methods(we didn't enable credit card and kmd payments, only website credits are usable to purchase in demo),
Released albums,
Subscription timings,
Upgradable plans for different type of musicians & labels.

@SŒûAD0X @Chipmoon 
Where traditional business models may just have subscriptions, using cryptocurrencies, especially the komodo ecosystem #cc-pegs #cc-prices related tech in the upcoming years would enable a new business model.

For example, if an artist needs automated redistribution service & they are paying $20/month, in this type of business the platform could offer to invest 50% of the subscription fee into a peg fund and other type of algorithmic trading and derivative market.  Any profits from such diversification of income stream can be used to offset future monthly payments for the artist, or for the investor an added opportunity to get knock-on effects of this type of investment.

If music royalties exist, then as they are accumulated over quarters or 6-month intervals, the same could be diverted into a fund of kinds.

These income streams can all pour into kmd network services - doesn‚Äôt have to be specific to music platforms.   Just an idea that popped up middle of the night on how this platform can be used.

The same applies to location data and services like ‚Äúdog walking uber‚Äù (wag app), where certain locations that are popular with dog ownership, the civic Centre has an opportunity to get development for the local environment, like dog park allotment, or safe drinking water fountains & the like.


[02-Oct-19 01:28 AM] SŒûAD0X#0001
Great ideas. I was also thinking licensing songs on blockchain is also a use case. But problem is a music company costs money unlike the wallet applications. It needs more funding, time & effort than other projects. But when it gets live, brings great roi.

Today is a major groundbreaking release for @edgewallet. Users in Europe can now buy and sell #Bitcoin with a bank account up to ‚Ç¨5000 per day with no KYC thanks to our integration partner @bity. To my Europe friends, please give it a try.

@jorian You are right, I also thought this.
But at least they are not asking people to send copies of documents which is unsafe (or do awful webcam verifications)

This is what Indacoin (https://indacoin.com) ask:
"To complete verification you‚Äôll need to enter the 4 digit code you receive via phone call. For your second step you may also be asked to undergo photo verification, which requires you to upload a photo of your passport/ID and a selfie with ID and a piece of paper with required text, confirming the purchase. We may alternatively ask for video verification, where you will need to record your face, say "Indacoin verification for crypto" show your ID and card you made the payment with. When showing the card, show only last 4 digits and the name."


[03-Oct-19 07:41 AM] xh311m4n#9873
I'm a bity user. You can use it without KYC with a limit of 4000CHF a year (buy and sell) last time I checked. If you want to be able to up your limit, you will have to KYC. 

Bity also operate a network of BTC/ETH ATMs in all major Swiss cities with a daily limit of 5000CHF I believe. You need 0 KYC for this...


[03-Oct-19 07:43 AM] xh311m4n#9873
Switzerland is crypto friendly yes, but will most likely have to enforce the latest iteration of the AML (#5) which kinda hammers down on crypto. We'll see what the Finma says...

because its a security feature. I am not writing a whole new antara thing, its not even worth calling an ecosystem project

unless you are writing a cc to use on any chain

` I was not asking for it, just asking if there were resources` - Yes, there are people here who might be interested in said funding, and usually we'd like to see a working product or code first. This was my advise.

Nothing hostile, no hard feelings, I like the idea of your project.


[04-Oct-19 02:56 AM] xeonrider#3120
I am not starting a big project. It seems that dPoW is a security feature of Komodo and it comes across as a necessity before releasing the coin out in the wild.

This is why i advised you to have a channel or discord where we can privately test your game, before you'd launch it

so there are no kickstarter platform of any kind or like programs

yes, very annoying... and i saw sites that are not even implementing it right... site is loading, but elements are missing
and if you use the developer tools of the browser you can see why: every request to those elements that don't show up get a 403 (unauthorized) and they are asking for the captcha stuff, but that is not visible on the main site, only in the developer tools

@xeonrider have you already created your dApp on ethereum?


[04-Oct-19 08:01 PM] Mylo#8306
if so, what token functions do you need?
build it on KMDICE, it gets dPoW already.   If it gets popular, the community will no doubt help you pay for dpow on it's own chain.


[05-Oct-19 05:23 AM] xeonrider#3120
@Mylo is it a fork or something like Verus?


[05-Oct-19 07:39 AM] gcharang#6833
@xeonrider it is a smartchain

@xeonrider yes it's a smartchain.   if you sync it with 
```
https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/blob/master/src/assetchains.old#L44
```
that command will start it, once synced, 
```
https://github.com/Komodo-Cakeshop/komodo-in-a-box/blob/master/setup/cc/tokens.sh#L37
```
üëÜ will list the tokens created on KMDICE with your rpcuser/pass/port

and then getting info about a specific token created  it can be done with 
```
https://github.com/Komodo-Cakeshop/komodo-in-a-box/blob/master/setup/cc/tokens.sh#L76
```
using the token id.


[06-Oct-19 09:25 PM] Mylo#8306

It builds on webmonetization (& other, but webmonetization is prioritized) APIs in-browser for grants.


[06-Oct-19 10:44 PM] Mylo#8306
At the moment a lot of this seems to be tied to ILP protocol - if anyone is interested in building an ILP connector for the komodo ecosystem, might be a good place to get funding for it.

@Mylo you also do the pangea front end? (poker game?)


[07-Oct-19 12:48 AM] Mylo#8306
Not me.  I haven‚Äôt been full-time dev for 10+ years.  I only do basic stuff these days üôÇ


[07-Oct-19 12:48 AM] xeonrider#3120
oh, just saw that the repo had like a front end for pangea with API calls


[07-Oct-19 12:48 AM] xeonrider#3120
because that would have been perfect


[07-Oct-19 12:49 AM] xeonrider#3120
so cakeshop is not yours?


[07-Oct-19 12:49 AM] Mylo#8306
Check the CHIPS discord for Pangea.
Yes cakeshop is some vuetifyjs stuff I did earlier this year


[07-Oct-19 12:50 AM] xeonrider#3120
yes, I am in there - I was planning a blackjack game, but then I saw chips. However, not a lot of documented resources but it looks pretty awesome.


[07-Oct-19 12:51 AM] xeonrider#3120
@Mylo oh cool, so there is already a web socket API ?


[07-Oct-19 12:52 AM] Mylo#8306
CHIPS will get easier to deploy in coming weeks.  Everything is accessible HTTP RPC.  CHIPS has websocketapi but i don‚Äôt know much about it


[07-Oct-19 12:52 AM] xeonrider#3120
I prefer to use unity (webgl, linux native) for my gamedev, web requests are awesome if they already work


[07-Oct-19 12:53 AM] xeonrider#3120
vue is cool üòÑ


[07-Oct-19 12:54 AM] xeonrider#3120
are you a webdev?


[07-Oct-19 01:06 AM] Mylo#8306
Not a pro dev.  Not a full time dev.  When I was younger i could code a bit in c++/java.  Web components are very useful.   Web is useful, and the javascript ecosystem is handy for prototypes but for production-level code, I‚Äôm not your man :)

There is a gaming-SDK currently being worked on.

If you‚Äôre going to make blackjack or any multiplayer gambling games, the CHIPS project is better for microtransactions between groups because of the network model of games (small groups of people).

If you‚Äôre going to build a platformer or rogue-like game, then using komodo and it‚Äôs token system will work for you.  All the calls are available by http RPC (not rest).   From a browser there is CORS limitation.   From standalone programs, no problem.

If you were to grab a game template from the unity asset store, adding token calls would be pretty trivial.

A lightweight P2P daemon is in development - this will likely replace needing to run a full node for taking advantage of the antara framework (application smarts on blockchain)


[07-Oct-19 01:09 AM] Mylo#8306
Seeing as you said you know ethereum, basically the lightweight nSPV daemon has all the functions of something like infura, but distributable in a small bundle (4MB memory, 500kB executable C code)

I am interested (but not keen yet) in testing small application implementations with the community in a micro loan setting over the next 6-12 months starting February 2020.  It is related to the collateralized lending system discussed in the #üé∞‚îÉask-jl777


[06-Dec-19 01:54 PM] Mylo#8306
The idea is to pilot some micro loan examples in units of 10KMD for *random internet jobs* like writing a blog or doing a graphic etc.


[06-Dec-19 01:55 PM] Mylo#8306
Plz contribute to conversation here or DM me your interest in the project if you prefer.  Cheers!


[06-Dec-19 02:08 PM] Mylo#8306
I already do something similar for a blog at HybridDEX.com 
Currently this is done using shapeshift to send an advance for some work.

Using the new tech, it would allow me to not exchange my KMD (eg I can hodl), and extract the value of KMD into EURK/USDK etc.

Replacing shapeshift as I currently use it, the payee (person receiving the advance/micro loan), can use atomicDEX to convert the EURK/USDK to a stablecoin supported by their local money changer.

Simple example.  Thanks for reading

Too many companies are making the mistake of focusing on products and services rather than customers.


[25-Dec-19 04:26 AM] smkhound#7640
some companies focus so much on the customer their services are just an excuse to sell their customer data as a product


[25-Dec-19 06:53 AM] actionslacks#4072
that's probably about 90% of the motivation behind smartphone app development. collecting and monetizing customer data.
