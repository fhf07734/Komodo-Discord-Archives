@jl777c are these the correct build instructions for the first time?


[22-Feb-19 01:36 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, but you might need to build komodod at least once before makecclib will work

I got as far as making a combined signature, but it didnt validate. so if you get a different result let me know. the crypto library is self-testing properly so it must be a bug in the code or my manual rpc

@jl777c should rogue,sudoku and musig be treated diffrently from the initial contracts like faucet,reward,dice etc., in the documementation? 
The difference I can see is that rogue,sudoku and musig are dynamic modules and are loaded using -ac_cclib
where as the contracts faucet,reward,dice etc., are available through -ac_cc

The main question is: is it temporary that both kind of contracts exist and are there plans to convert the -ac_cc contracts to -ac_cclib type?


[22-Feb-19 05:52 AM] jl777c#5810
there are built in contracts and dynamic


[22-Feb-19 05:53 AM] jl777c#5810
likely there will always be this difference


[22-Feb-19 05:53 AM] jl777c#5810
things like gateways would want to be built in


[22-Feb-19 05:53 AM] jl777c#5810

In the case of my test, all pubkeys for the signature are in the same node, is this something i should not do?


[22-Feb-19 06:08 AM] jl777c#5810
it is designed for one pubkey per node


[22-Feb-19 06:09 AM] siu#3920
🤦 need to import the second pubkey to another node then


[22-Feb-19 06:12 AM] gcharang#6833
@jl777c 
```
first make a combined pk
```
`pk` is pubkey?


[22-Feb-19 06:13 AM] siu#3920
yes

@jl777c I've called `nonce` succesfully from first node, but on second node daemon crashing on nonce exchange attempt:
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=MUSIG cclib nonce 18 \"[%22b8d60ea48994385b8e7038b5586b2475211225e0c6e66173aaedcd8f437c3945%22,0,%2203e5463b110330e15ccc5377de92678fe998760b01ea99caa89194fb3ef9d40923%22]\"```

[22-Feb-19 01:12 PM] TonyL#3577
Ahh maybe it's because to second node I've only downloaded komodod komodo-cli and komodo-tx from first node but some other files needed


[22-Feb-19 01:16 PM] TonyL#3577
@siu https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/hXx69NPfDb/ issued nonce call succesfully - it just crashed on second node with backtrace above, tomorrow will build daemon on this node from scratch and try again


[22-Feb-19 01:18 PM] siu#3920
I did the 0 and 1 tries. But it didnt work for me on any of the combinations, will try again to see.


[22-Feb-19 01:19 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe you've mistaken somewhere on previous steps (I did it twice when tried)
No need to try combinations - it's messages rebroadcast: to node 0 you broadcast message from node 1, to node 1 you broadcast message from node 0


[22-Feb-19 01:20 PM] TonyL#3577
So in calls (I mean messages exchange, not session opening) on node0 it's always will be 1, in calls on node1 it'll be 0


[22-Feb-19 01:24 PM] siu#3920
Maybe it needs a specific turn? Node 0 first than 1?


[22-Feb-19 01:25 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm not sure if exchange order in session matters. I've followed example when tested (called on first node then on second node)

@jl777c I understand right now, the daemon can be built with only one of the dynamic modules: rogue or musig, but if in the future daemon is built with both modules present, can `-ac_cclib` take both the modules rogue,musig as parameters and start a chain?

[23-Feb-19 12:51 AM] jl777c#5810
@gcharang the idea is that there is a libcc dynamic lib that has all the CC you want in it. there needs to be a sane build process to make this. unfortunately i dont really do build process, i just write code so someone else will need to make it a sane process. the important thing is that N different CC can be bundled into a single libcc


[23-Feb-19 12:53 AM] gcharang#6833
Got it, can `-ac_cclib` take multiple modules as parameters and the chain have all the specifies modules enabled?

oh , these modules in the libcc will be available along with faucet,dice, rewards just through `-ac_cc`?

[23-Feb-19 01:01 AM] jl777c#5810
you can even limit which of the built in ones are available with -ac_ccenable=evalcode0,evalcode1,...


[23-Feb-19 01:02 AM] jl777c#5810
in which case only the specified evalcodes are available

plus whatever ones are in libcc if ac_cclib was there

there is not much "smarts" to what is available or not

>What are: PubkeyCCaddress(CClib), CClibCCTokensAddress

Not sure of this question.

>What is the difference between myCCAddress(CClib) and myCCAddress

CCAddress is the address calculated from the EVAL code from the specific CC


[23-Feb-19 05:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
CC address of yours would be different to normal KMD/Assetchain Address, but it'd be specific to your own `pubkey`'s


[23-Feb-19 05:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
You need to start your CC enabled chain with a `pubkey` on daemon start.


[23-Feb-19 05:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Or at least setpubkey for that CC chain if it's already started


[23-Feb-19 05:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
So, you get the CCAddress for that same pubkey,


[23-Feb-19 05:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I guess that's the description, unless it needs correction.


[23-Feb-19 05:47 AM] jl777c#5810

for all but the combine sig step, all nodes need to get all data

good its crashing on combined sig step. retrying with gdb

Having a lot of trouble getting past the combining of nonce's


[23-Feb-19 07:13 AM] jl777c#5810
you made the combined pubkey?


[23-Feb-19 07:13 AM] jl777c#5810
the session is the tricky one. maybe the idea of spawning a bunch of nodes is the way to go?


[23-Feb-19 07:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
Im not sure its the way I am doing it that is the problem


[23-Feb-19 07:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
It seems to work just fine


[23-Feb-19 07:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
Its crashing when tryiing to combine nonce here:
`if ( secp256k1_musig_set_nonce(ctx,&MUSIG[myind]->signer_data[i],&MUSIG[myind]->nonces[i]) == 0 )`


[23-Feb-19 07:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
Seems to be that it doesnt have all of them, so I made it only proceed to this step on the last index, but that causes this to happen:
`error combining nonces`


[23-Feb-19 07:18 AM] jl777c#5810
MUSIG[] is an array of pointers? all allocated?


[23-Feb-19 07:18 AM] jl777c#5810
and all filled out with session


[23-Feb-19 07:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
yes. It creates the commitments, and the nonce fine... Once thing I did find a bit strange on the nonce creation that the first call is the only return of nonce.


[23-Feb-19 07:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
I used a vectror of pointers, and just push_back them in order...


[23-Feb-19 07:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
then restart daemon to try again


[23-Feb-19 07:20 AM] Deleted User#0000

if all the commitments are made, then a node will be able to reveal the nonce


[23-Feb-19 07:22 AM] Deleted User#0000
nonce is revealed once so I saved those in the python script


[23-Feb-19 07:22 AM] Deleted User#0000
its breaking when I try to use the nonces

you cant start a new session once you start the process

Im not


[23-Feb-19 07:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
it starts a session.. I think... I assume the session is confined to the musig_struct


[23-Feb-19 07:23 AM] jl777c#5810
the way I had it there was only one MUSIG dataset, you need to make it allow multiple

[23-Feb-19 07:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
What happens is the nonce is returned on the first commitment... so like 
the first node MUSIG[0] you add the commitment from MUSIG[1] adn the nonce is returned immediatly


[23-Feb-19 07:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
then when adding MUSIG[2] and MUSIG[3] it does not return a nonce.


[23-Feb-19 07:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
then when I try top use that nonce its fails


[23-Feb-19 07:27 AM] jl777c#5810
sprintf(&str[i<<1],"%02x",MUSIG[myind]->nonce_commitments[MUSIG[myind]->myind*32 + i]);
there is no need to do MUSIG[myind]->myind to get myind


[23-Feb-19 07:28 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems you are not setting the nonces for most of the MUSIG ptrs


[23-Feb-19 07:28 AM] jl777c#5810
each MUSIG ptr needs to get all the other nonces


[23-Feb-19 07:28 AM] jl777c#5810
for (i=0; i<MUSIG->num; i++)
->         if ( ind != MUSIG[myind]->num-1 )
?


[23-Feb-19 07:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
stopped it crashing, but didnt work


[23-Feb-19 07:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
idea was to only combine once they were all there


[23-Feb-19 07:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
but that doesnt work. I think the problem is the step before


[23-Feb-19 07:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
because it return nonce as soon as it has just a single commitment


[23-Feb-19 07:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
I thaught it needed all of them?


[23-Feb-19 07:30 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[23-Feb-19 07:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
maybe I need to jkust try 3 nodes manually


[23-Feb-19 07:30 AM] jl777c#5810
all MUSIG need all commitments to generate a nonce


[23-Feb-19 07:30 AM] jl777c#5810
and all MUSIG need all nonces


[23-Feb-19 07:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
well its not working tha way


[23-Feb-19 07:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
it taking its own comitment


[23-Feb-19 07:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
and as soona s you add on


[23-Feb-19 07:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
it returns a nonce


[23-Feb-19 07:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
my code shouldnt have changed anything there


[23-Feb-19 07:31 AM] jl777c#5810
well I assumed it returned an error if there werent enough commitments to return a nonce


[23-Feb-19 07:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
no it doesnt...


[23-Feb-19 07:31 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe manually is the next step to do?


[23-Feb-19 07:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
or well to be mroe specific, it just doenst check they are all there, and just returns one as soon as you combine 2 commitments


[23-Feb-19 07:32 AM] Deleted User#0000
then when you try to add more, it seemingly ignores them. They are added, but I dont think they are being used


[23-Feb-19 07:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yes I tguess I will need to try with 3 nodes without my changes, unless I can figure this out.


[23-Feb-19 07:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think it will act the same way.


[23-Feb-19 07:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
I got it working


[23-Feb-19 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
what was the trick?


[23-Feb-19 08:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
```if ( ind != MUSIG[myind]->num-1 )
        {
            fprintf(stderr, "ind.%i MUSIG[myind]->num.%i\n", ind, MUSIG[myind]->num);
            return(cclib_error(result,"need rest of nonce's to continue"));
        }```
Put this on every step


[23-Feb-19 08:05 AM] Deleted User#0000
thats really not going to be a solution for actual seperate nodes though maybe? Because I am doing everyhting in an exact order its easier to control


[23-Feb-19 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
for separate nodes, the way I had it should work


[23-Feb-19 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
the issues are having multiple session data structurs


[23-Feb-19 08:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
I am not so sure, I will test that at a later time. The problem is that its returning that nonce as soon as you call `commit` the veryt first time. So it wroks fine for only 2 nodes, but going any higher thatn that it breaks, and returns a nonce before ti has all the commitments.


[23-Feb-19 08:16 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, maybe we need to track how many commitments it has and only ask for nonce after it has all of them?


[23-Feb-19 08:16 AM] jl777c#5810
if it only works for 2 pubkeys, its pretty worthless


[23-Feb-19 08:16 AM] Deleted User#0000

if you sue my repo and the script I modified the daemon to be able to simulate unlimded daemons

I created the MUSIG struct as a vector of sctructs and just simulate unlimited daemons.. its limited by ram. Mylo is runnign at est with 5500 pubkeys atm on 64GB ram server 😄


[23-Feb-19 11:56 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
very cool!


[23-Feb-19 11:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
simple as mine some coins, start script. press `y` and type number of pubkeys and wait... I think 5500 pubkeys is something like `90750000` RPC calls 😂

komodod doesn't compile from jl777 repo on mac, and I guess the chances from jl777/jl777 branch are not in komodoplatform/komodo/jl777 branch...
so, I'll just test things with linux vm


[23-Feb-19 11:57 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

[23-Feb-19 11:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
yes I used ubuntu 16.04 VM's here to test 2 nodes


[23-Feb-19 11:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
jl777 branch and repo on latest works, but only with 2 nodes


[23-Feb-19 11:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
it gets extemlly complicated with more than 2, and the daemon has a bug where you will get stuck after the `commit` step


[23-Feb-19 11:59 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I want to test, so that I can make it included in my kmdgo package 🙂


[24-Feb-19 12:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
testing also makes things clearer and gives more ideas how it can be used in different usecases


[24-Feb-19 12:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
cool. its reasonably easy for 2 nodes... I had some trouble early on, but the example and gcharngs docs will clear those up well.


[24-Feb-19 12:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

I think so yes.


[24-Feb-19 12:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
my repo's fix doesnt seem like a good way to go about it for multiple nodes.


[24-Feb-19 12:14 AM] Deleted User#0000
the steps `commit`, `nonce` and `partialsig` where the data is swapped between all nodes, needs to make sure that all the data is in there before creating the next hash.


[24-Feb-19 12:14 AM] Deleted User#0000
I did it by sending each lot of data in exact order and only generateing hash on the last node.


[24-Feb-19 12:14 AM] Deleted User#0000
not sure in real world thats practical...


[24-Feb-19 12:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
It should just check to make sure all feilds are populated somehow.


[24-Feb-19 12:21 AM] jl777c#5810
is that restriction for nonce only, or also partial sigs?


[24-Feb-19 12:22 AM] jl777c#5810
I can add a counter at the required steps and only do the combine after all are there


[24-Feb-19 12:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
I ended up adding it for all 3 of those steps, not 100% sure if it needs it for all, but I know 100% that it works when used for all.


[24-Feb-19 12:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
to generate nonce, you need all commits. Pretty sure to generate partialsig you need all nonce, and to generate the combined sig, you need all partial sig.


[24-Feb-19 12:28 AM] Deleted User#0000
it doesnt check this currently and as such gives wrong outputs.


[24-Feb-19 12:38 AM] jl777c#5810

instead of erroring out, it just crashes


[24-Feb-19 02:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
I couldnt figure out how to check if the data was there or not so worked around the issue, with executing the commands in an excact specified order using a python script


[24-Feb-19 02:28 AM] Deleted User#0000
You need to really pay attention to what order things are done. One tip I will give you is that the 3 steps to trade data are all the same RPC call, so just use the absh history and change the single hash, along with the name of the cclib call.


[24-Feb-19 02:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay, this time it gave at least errro instead of crashing komodod

session, commit, commit, commit..., then nonce, nonce, nonce, ...


[24-Feb-19 02:55 AM] jl777c#5810
all nodes need all commits to be able to generate a nonce


[24-Feb-19 02:56 AM] jl777c#5810
need all nonces to be able to do a partial sig


[24-Feb-19 02:56 AM] jl777c#5810
need all partial sigs to be able to do a combined sig


[24-Feb-19 02:56 AM] jl777c#5810
think multisig in three stages. all participants need to do each stage until you can start the next stage

the dilithium is much easier, as it is the normal keypair model


[24-Feb-19 03:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yep, was doing the same.
I execute command one node 1 till command `calcmsg`

after than, execute command `session` on node 1, and save the `commitment` output
then execute `session` on node 2, and save the `commitment` output in text file

then make the `commit` command based on the previous output and execute on node 1, and save the `nonce` output
and make the `commit` command based on previous session output and execute on node 2, and save the `nonce` output

and then execute `nonce` command on node 1 and there I got that error and status outputs.

verified the size of hex is 289 bytes


[24-Feb-19 04:50 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
```notice how small the tx is! 289 bytes as it is sent to the destpubtxid, which in turn contains the handle, pub33 and bigpub. the handle is used for error check, pub33 is used to make the destination CC address, so the normal CC signing needs to be passed in addition to the spend restrictions for dilithium.```


[24-Feb-19 04:51 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
what commands I use to see the handle, pub33 and bigpub ?

wonder how mylos 5500 sig test went 🤔


[24-Feb-19 07:29 AM] jl777c#5810
keypair without any params shows the big pubkey


[24-Feb-19 07:29 AM] jl777c#5810
pub33 is your -pubkey= parameter if you didnt specify an external or "rand" privkey


[24-Feb-19 07:29 AM] jl777c#5810
handle is not shown, it is used for an error check so you need to track it externally


[24-Feb-19 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
@CHMEX I pushed a hardforking update that supports dilithium validation. i had things configured to be more strict (instead of less strict), so as soon as someone broadcasts a valid dilithium spend, it will fork the chain. jl777 branch

Is quantum resistant transactions archieved with musig by forking chain on every transaction?


[24-Feb-19 07:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
no its a diffrent signing.. musig and the quantum resitant are diffrent CC's


[24-Feb-19 07:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
musig just allows very large amounts of signers to multi sig. I did 1000 pubkey spend already a few days ago


[24-Feb-19 07:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
@Mylo  start a 5500 pubkey one, but maybe it was too many even for a 64GB of ram machine.

dilithium forked the chain


[24-Feb-19 09:48 PM] jl777c#5810
if you merge in just the dilithium parts and not the musig.cpp, most all should just work. i think one function was renamed and moved for parsing args

the session call has a parameter that is pointer to memory scratchpad, but they dont describe how much RAM is needed. it crashed when I send in a scratchpad pointer, so i just use null. they say that uses an inefficient memory allocation. to get really high numbers probably that needs to be changed

we arent end users, are we? we cant expect all the builds to just magically work as things are updated left and right


[24-Feb-19 10:43 PM] jl777c#5810
so if things are not building, then figure out how to solve it. if you cant do that, you need to wait the months it takes for builds to automagically work in all configs


[24-Feb-19 10:44 PM] jl777c#5810

[24-Feb-19 10:45 PM] gcharang#6833
Well, I googled about the error, most suggestions were to change the version of berkely db to 4.8 and download it from bitcoin core's ppa. Tried that too. Still didn't work. So asked here


[24-Feb-19 10:45 PM] jl777c#5810
this error is always happening with the komodo builds, you never saw that before?


[24-Feb-19 10:46 PM] jl777c#5810
whenever the makefile change, it seems to get all confused. in any case using build.sh is not any magical deep understanding required


[24-Feb-19 10:47 PM] gcharang#6833
didn't see this particular error before. I knew to run build.sh again for an error that had `all recursive failed` or something likethat. 
Will run build.sh again next time if I run into build errors 👍


[24-Feb-19 10:48 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, any build error, run build.sh


[24-Feb-19 10:48 PM] jl777c#5810
if still a problem make clean and build.sh, that seems to be needed sometimes


[24-Feb-19 10:48 PM] jl777c#5810
in extreme cases a fresh clone


[24-Feb-19 10:48 PM] jl777c#5810
so there are three levels of using build.sh if normal make doesnt work

@jl777c  
If you could test this for 2/3 nodes @grewalsatinder  that would be helpful. I think it works. Definatly works on a single node, however the free of memory is not working, and requires a daemon restart to free the memory used before you can do another combine send and spend.

To use the `musigtest.py`, just start the daemon without -pubkey. Then run the script inside `komodo/src` once you have some coins, either mine or faucetget. Changed script to take less than 1 coin sends aswell, and added much more helpful prints so you can see what is happening.

One thing I noticed while doing this, its possible to change pubkey in runtime, at least with this. For MUSIG chain you can change pubkey as many times as you like.

- is it always going to be a character? 
@jl777c


[25-Feb-19 06:12 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, for rpc that dont generate a tx, just a mneumonic. for tx, it is the funcid in the opreturn


[25-Feb-19 06:14 AM] gcharang#6833
Is there any use for someone using the rpc interface ?

[25-Feb-19 06:37 AM] gcharang#6833
@jl777c are the below statements true?
```md
- The node that broadcasts it's `hex` of the spend transaction receives the funds in the multisig address.
- If both nodes broadcast their `hex` of the spend transaction, which ever transaction confirms first, the corresponding node gets credited with the spend.
```


[25-Feb-19 06:45 AM] jl777c#5810
no


[25-Feb-19 06:45 AM] jl777c#5810
neither are true


[25-Feb-19 06:45 AM] jl777c#5810
well maybe it is


[25-Feb-19 06:45 AM] jl777c#5810
it depends on the details of the spend


[25-Feb-19 06:46 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess using the spend rpc, yes it would be the case. but the idea is that all signers will verify the tx that is being signed


[25-Feb-19 06:54 AM] gcharang#6833
@jl777c  Ok. So they are currently true for someone using the RPC.
I am guessing the `calcmsg` RPC will be modified in the future to include a `recipient pubkey`?


[25-Feb-19 07:13 AM] jl777c#5810
you pass in the destination scriptPubKey already


[25-Feb-19 07:41 AM] gcharang#6833
@jl777c as I understand it, the scriptPubKey that is being passed in, belongs to the vout that returns change to the sender. 
And I am not sure how this scriptPubKey is being used right now


[25-Feb-19 07:43 AM] jl777c#5810
that is where the funds are sent


[25-Feb-19 05:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
that confused me for ages... why it was using the change scriptPubKey ... its the destination of the spennd, took a while to work that one out lol


[25-Feb-19 10:47 PM] jl777c#5810
i just wanted a scriptPubKey that I would be able to spend


[25-Feb-19 10:47 PM] jl777c#5810
doesnt have to be the change


[25-Feb-19 10:48 PM] jl777c#5810
can be any scriptPubKey, it is just the destination for funds


[25-Feb-19 11:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
yes might be a good thing to put in docs. Has anyone tested musig since my PR yesterday?


[27-Feb-19 05:29 AM] gcharang#6833
@jl777c what is `pk_hash`?
In the source, I have found
```
pk_hash: The 32-byte hash of the original public keys
```
does that mean the original pubkeys are concatenated and hashed? to get a 32 byte hash?


[27-Feb-19 05:32 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, it identifies a specific set of pubkeys for the in-memory data structure


[27-Feb-19 05:42 AM] gcharang#6833
Got it.


[27-Feb-19 06:59 AM] gcharang#6833
@jl777c if the signers wanted to spend to <pubkeyA>, the calcmessage method will be:
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MUSIG  cclib calcmsg 18 '["sendtxid1","21<<pubkeyA>>ac"]'
 ```
Is that so?


[27-Feb-19 07:01 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[27-Feb-19 07:01 AM] gcharang#6833
and they will spend only the amount added through the txid: `sendtxid1`?


[27-Feb-19 07:02 AM] jl777c#5810
it will only spend the sendtxid/vout0


[27-Feb-19 07:04 AM] gcharang#6833
can the musig address be funded using the `sendtoaddress` rpc, i.e., convert `combined_pk` to address format and use `sendtoaddress`? @jl777c


[27-Feb-19 07:05 AM] jl777c#5810
no


[27-Feb-19 07:05 AM] jl777c#5810
the musig send must be used


[27-Feb-19 07:06 AM] gcharang#6833
Ok


[27-Feb-19 07:06 AM] jl777c#5810

I am stuck on the signing part


[27-Feb-19 07:53 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
any 32 bytes data which is a hex is fine


[27-Feb-19 07:53 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
for testing, I just used a privkey of an address


[27-Feb-19 07:54 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
used my own kmdgo go test code to generate that privkey, but a new tester can probably try using some online website to generate random 32 byte hex string


[27-Feb-19 07:54 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
the example shows a hex string


[27-Feb-19 08:03 PM] Alright#0419

If there are 3 signers and
-  **node1** produces  `nonce13` using `commitment3` from **node3**
-  **node1** produces  `nonce12` using `commitment2` from **node2**
so it will send back `nonce13` to **node3** and `nonce12` to  **node2**. thats it correct? **node2** won't need  `nonce13` ? @jl777c


[28-Feb-19 06:11 AM] gcharang#6833
@jl777c is the `spend` method updated to spend to the `scriptPubkey` provided or is it spending to the pubkey of it's own node right now?


[28-Feb-19 06:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
every node needs every nonce


[28-Feb-19 06:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
if you know any python look at the `musigtest.py` I think its resasonably easy to follow


[28-Feb-19 06:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
for each node, it loops all nodes and gives them the nonce it has. same for the next 3 steps


[28-Feb-19 06:47 AM] gcharang#6833
so does node2 run both these commands and another 2 with ind:2
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MUSIG cclib nonce 18 '["pkhash",0,"nonce produced by n0 using commit from n2"]'
```
and
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MUSIG cclib nonce 18 '["pkhash",0,"nonce produced by n0 using commit from n3"]'
```
notice both the above commands have ind: 0

Hi, after doing `sendrawtransaction` to broadcast my tx, how do I verify if it is successful?


[28-Feb-19 08:07 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
After I broadcast the transaction it seems to be not showing on the explorer


[28-Feb-19 08:24 AM] gcharang#6833
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=MUSIG getrawtransaction <txid> 1`


[28-Feb-19 08:25 AM] gcharang#6833
@josephnicholas GMT+8 at the bottom of the response for the above command, there is`rawconfirmations`


[28-Feb-19 08:26 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
@gcharang thanks, but I should be mining also right so that there will confirmations?


[28-Feb-19 08:27 AM] gcharang#6833
yes you should be mining for txns to be confirmed.


[28-Feb-19 08:27 AM] gcharang#6833
But if you are using MUSIG chain, some one is already mining it so you don't need to @josephnicholas GMT+8


[28-Feb-19 08:28 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Yes, I am trying to create my own chain locally with 2 computers, but they dont seem to connect, thats why I can't mine


[28-Feb-19 08:29 AM] gcharang#6833
ah! easist setup is to use vps with static ip.


[28-Feb-19 08:30 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Yeah, but one question, how do I change my config so that I can connect to specific port? Since as far as I can see my nodes have diff p2pport that's why it won't connect


[28-Feb-19 08:38 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
even with 6 confirmations it can't be seen in the explorer.


[28-Feb-19 08:38 AM] gcharang#6833
Is the explorer on the same node showing the confs?


[28-Feb-19 08:41 AM] gcharang#6833
Also, I know how to change rpcport, but afaik the p2pport is default. @josephnicholas GMT+8 
I would recommend you do `getinfo` call on both nodes and compare if 
```
  "p2pport": 33924,
  "rpcport": 33925,
  "magic": 103274924,
```
are same on both nodes

if "magic" is different, then they are different chains and won't talk to each other


[28-Feb-19 08:42 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Oh no. So how do I create a chain that have same p2p port?


[28-Feb-19 08:44 AM] gcharang#6833
"magic": is the more important number, if thats the same, then others will be correct.

testing musig on the latest jl777 branch.
```bash
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MUSIG1 cclib nonce 18 '["8897e150bfb07d3f967ffadb4b0f3c84ea73a94c0d715c4b7e6d9c816c5113a9",1,"03035897a2bb653805490a88b5a90821403ce29f355fb0093690746082f6a0a618"]'

  "status": "not enough nonces",
  "result": "success"
}
```
any thing I might have done wrong?


[12-Mar-19 06:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
it doesnt have enough nonces ?


[12-Mar-19 06:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
@gcharang  Its also possible that I broke it when I merged the single node test in.


[12-Mar-19 06:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
what you need to do is ` "added_index": 1,` needs to be added for ALL nodes, for single node this *should* mean you dont need to add yourself. 
That said I had to chagne that for single node simulation, so that was skipped, maybe it is applying to multi node aswell, although its should not. I will have a look at it soon. 
There was a nasty bug with the noncstep and I had to make it extremly strict about proceeding or it would crashe the daemon evey time.


[12-Mar-19 10:11 PM] gcharang#6833
I was only testing with 2 nodes so this may not have affected it?


[12-Mar-19 10:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
well.. like I said it could be a bug


[12-Mar-19 10:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
try sending the nonce to yourself


[12-Mar-19 10:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
like so all nonce are sent to all nodes, even to them self


[12-Mar-19 10:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
if that works its a bug on my end


[12-Mar-19 11:33 PM] gcharang#6833
will try


[13-Mar-19 01:49 AM] gcharang#6833
@Deleted User 
I tried adding the commitment produced on the same node to itself, but that too errored.
You will have to take a look at the code sometime

Suddenly getting this on one of my machines after rebuilding to latest jl777 branch. Isn't happening on any other machine with seemingly the same build. Has anyone ever seen this before? I don't see any relevant changes to jl777 branch that would have affected this

I dont really understand why it does that ... The problem is that it must have all nonce before moving past, but it seems if its strict enough ... then it can never pass., as soon as you remvoe that limit then it crashes


[18-Mar-19 02:38 AM] gcharang#6833

maybe the check there needs to be diffrent, and actuall check the nonnces rather than just counting them

Dont need to ... I had it working with over 2000 keys


[18-Mar-19 02:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
as long as 100% of nonce are in each memporyt struct it works without crashing

what you need to know, is that its added both indexes...


[18-Mar-19 02:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
if they are both there, then it should not crash.


[18-Mar-19 02:42 AM] gcharang#6833
One thing that became clear to me after looking at the above doc is:
when there are 3 nodes
node1 produces only one nonce after both the commitments from the other nodes are added
I used to think it will produce a nonce for each commitment added


[18-Mar-19 02:42 AM] gcharang#6833
will change that line and run it again


[18-Mar-19 02:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
no on every step it MUST have every single hash generated by every node


[18-Mar-19 02:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
The python script shows how I acheived this `musigtest.py`


[18-Mar-19 02:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
but it only works on a single node


[18-Mar-19 02:43 AM] gcharang#6833
it will have them but it produces a hash only after data from all the other nodes is added to it


[18-Mar-19 02:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
yes and the code doesnt check very well that they are all there... its works until nonce step


[18-Mar-19 02:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
then crashes if all data isnt avalible


[18-Mar-19 02:44 AM] Deleted User#0000
really stumped me... we added checks to not let it pass unless every hash is there, but it seems somehow it stil l lets you proceed. 
I think maybe, we need to just force that a node must send its own hash to itself liek I did in my script...


[18-Mar-19 02:44 AM] Deleted User#0000
Or the counter needs to actually check the hashes are there rather than just counting how many you added, because user error will just crashiit every time otherwise


[18-Mar-19 02:46 AM] gcharang#6833
I was testing it with only 2 nodes.
added nonce from second node and it crashed so no user error in this case


[18-Mar-19 02:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
I dont really understand how it does it tbh ... it will still crash is the steps beforehand didn assign everything


[18-Mar-19 02:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
We need a proper check on each stage that checks the actual hashes are there, not just counting them.


[18-Mar-19 02:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
But I dont know how to make that.

I am documenting the rpc for dilithium,
```json
    {
      "evalcode": 19,
      "funcid": "S",
      "name": "dilithium",
      "method": "sign",
      "help": "msg [hexseed]",
      "params_required": 1,
      "params_max": 2
    },
```
for the `sign` rpc, are there any restrictions on what msg can be?
For the command,:
```bash
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MUSIG cclib sign 19 '["Quantum Resistance is awesome!","a70a8e7d2281beaf0762a11590fb566d7af32325ae4252609149de37658e2eb5"]'

  "error": "couldnt parse message to sign"
}
```


[11-Apr-19 04:29 AM] Alright#0419
it's a debug rpc for the most part


[11-Apr-19 04:29 AM] Alright#0419
it doesn't actually seem to have a purpose other than to check that underlying dilithium features are working


[11-Apr-19 04:31 AM] Alright#0419
did you try something like 
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=MUSIG cclib sign 19 "[%22Quantum Resistance is awesome!%22,%22a70a8e7d2281beaf0762a11590fb566d7af32325ae4252609149de37658e2eb5%22]'"`
?

Ah it doesn't work on arbitrary strings, forgot about this


[11-Apr-19 04:43 AM] Alright#0419
think it needs to be 32 bytes of hex

again it's just a debug rpc, never actually used


[11-Apr-19 04:44 AM] gcharang#6833
