Hey @ph03nix glad to see you brother!


[22-Oct-18 11:17 AM] Nacho Figx#4221
Well @Seko let¬¥s get the things rolling


[22-Oct-18 11:18 AM] Nacho Figx#4221
If you guys know some Komodo Developers, we will need them to help for building the platform.


[22-Oct-18 11:21 AM] Alright#0419
What is pixdum?


[22-Oct-18 11:21 AM] Flexatron#8809
Lol yea


[22-Oct-18 11:21 AM] Nacho Figx#4221
It will be a Decentralized Gaming Platform, www.pixdum.com based on the Komodo Technology


[22-Oct-18 11:30 AM] Nacho Figx#4221
If you still see Elastos mentioned on the website or the white paper, it is beacuse we were thinking on using Elastos Technology previously but now we have decided to go 100% with Komodo Platform.

hey Ignacio, glad to see the ball is still rolling, nice choice of platforms üò∫


[22-Oct-18 12:27 PM] wookie#7663
do you have games ready to go? do the games still need to be built?


[22-Oct-18 12:35 PM] Nacho Figx#4221
We want to concentrate in the Platform first, but if there are games already built, then we can use them to add them, there are so many games being creted but big corporations do not allow the general public to publish them on their platforms, Pixdum on the contrary will open the platform so anyone who wish to bring his own game can bring it.


[22-Oct-18 01:12 PM] FishyGuts#5085
How did you hear about Komodo and what made you decide to switch platforms?


[22-Oct-18 01:20 PM] Buddz1993  HYPEBEARS FAN üêª‚ùÑ#5380
thats amazing  seriously


[22-Oct-18 01:20 PM] Buddz1993  HYPEBEARS FAN üêª‚ùÑ#5380
possibily airdrop also for KMD Holders?


[22-Oct-18 01:45 PM] Nacho Figx#4221
@FishyGuts I have been liking JL777¬¥s ideas since he was in NXT.org, atomic swaps, 1 M transactions per second in the future, Decentralized exchange and Lighting Network some of the tools we are willing to use in the Platform.


[22-Oct-18 01:47 PM] Nacho Figx#4221
Blockchain interoperability and Smart Contracts as well


[22-Oct-18 01:47 PM] Nacho Figx#4221
@Buddz1993  HYPEBEARS FAN üêª‚ùÑ yes we will airdrop to KMD Holders as well.

[22-Oct-18 01:52 PM] Nacho Figx#4221
We will have a total of 500 Million PXDs as total supply and 50 M for aridrop and bounties, things can change for better as long as we give value to the community.

[02-Nov-18 10:18 AM] Nacho Figx#4221
As I said, I would like ARRR to be another coin inside the Pixdum Platform for buying and selling non-fungible assets. I am sure we can achieve it.


[02-Nov-18 11:21 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I would say that as a chain, we are willing to find ways to integrate.  
I will get with you in DM about the ideas for gamifying the onboarding process for Pirate.

@Nacho Figx I have a journo writing an article for THE BLOCK https://www.theblockcrypto.com/ and can possibly give you a slot if you answer these questions for her...   

1. Amid the bear market, what has been the effect aside from the token price drop? (eg. delays, cutbacks, staff reductions)?  
2. What % of its reserves are in crypto?  
3. What plans does the company have to mitigate the market?  
4. Do you believe the product will be scalable and in what timeframe?  I need answers ASAP.
