this is related to subatomic, but now that we can have dedicated channels for dev topics without worry about it being archived, i made a new channel just for betdapp. it operates similarily but not exactly the same as subatomic.

eventually this will use the EURK stablecoin, but we need to wait a bit before it is ready for that. in the meantime i made a chain just for this call DORN: -ac_name=DORN -ac_cc=2 -ac_supply=1000000 -ac_reward=100000000 -addnode=136.243.58.134

the initial game will be a simple double or nothing game, you send in one bet, and get back double or nothing. for now it is working without channels, but it is just to test the state machine. by friday, i hope to have it using CC channels for realtime bets (5 to 10 seconds). the -dexp2p network to use is the BET chain, you can have it as a -nSPV=1 chain to avoid having to sync it.

bob runs ./betdapp DORN "" DORN with the appropriate DORN<->DORN swap, use the same volA and volB, there isnt much error checking yet.
alice runs ./betdapp DORN <id> <total>
the <total> will be 1000x the betsize as a CC channel has max payments of 1000. so you will get 1000 bets, current the test just issues 10 bets and gets either 2x back via payments or 0x back via fullypaid

let me restart the bob node properly


[20-Feb-20 04:17 AM] jl777c#5810
each "swap" starts a state machine, that actually lives across instances of betdapp


[20-Feb-20 04:18 AM] jl777c#5810
so it remembered that 281736288 already did an openrequest and currently to simplify error cases, unless it is brand new state.0, it wont do anything more


[20-Feb-20 04:18 AM] jl777c#5810
this is to avoid two different instances processing the same state machine, which would create a mess

not sure whats going on. alice is seeing bob's messages but bob is not seeing alice's

maybe we have too few dexp2p nodes online?


[20-Feb-20 04:32 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, change betdapp.c line 18: DEXP2P_CHAIN to be "DORN"


[20-Feb-20 04:33 AM] jl777c#5810
this way the BET chain wont be used for dexp2p, the DORN chain will


[20-Feb-20 04:33 AM] jl777c#5810
of course add -dexp2p=2 when launching DORN chain

just that both coins are DORN

ok, its updated, but until i get a new update for channels CC, it will be generating errors. i am getting the same performance as before, which is 5 seconds per bet. will still need more enhancements and debugging with the updated CC channels, but it seems the structure is mostly in place

can the DORN chain be updated so zkparams need not be downloaded using chain param -ac_public=1 with this PR https://github.com/jl777/komodo/pull/1819 sometime this month?
i'd like to build a docker image for redistribution and testing

{Embed}
https://github.com/jl777/komodo/pull/1819
Do not load zksnark params on ac_public chains by leto ¬∑ Pull Reque...
Params are loaded during app init before any block data is loaded, so I was not able to look for a recent unix timestamp in the first block.
If necessary, this check could be deferred until block 1...

its merged, but you will need to make a new chain as changing ac_public will hardfork the chain
