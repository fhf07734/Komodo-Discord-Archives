like the reaction thing, and then gives roles on what you can see?

☝️ 

[14-Aug-20 09:24 AM] joe_land1#1088
so maybe like theres like "overview role" which gives you access to the "general chat" of each category


[14-Aug-20 09:25 AM] joe_land1#1088
then if ur specifically interested in a certain concentration


[14-Aug-20 09:25 AM] joe_land1#1088
say dev work


[14-Aug-20 09:25 AM] joe_land1#1088
then u get access to the whole dev category


[14-Aug-20 09:27 AM] Jcharming#2693
That's a good idea, meta- categories as an options for setting up default along side the 'customize' option where a user specifically just picks their channels for the default start, but is still editable later.

@Audo talks about that we're going to review various community managment methods which Audo will lead via stream.  
This is to generate discussion and get ideas flowing about how different places have methods for community managment. 

@Artakush   suggests HIVE as one of the community management solutions 

@Jcharming comments to increase and further optimize the bot logics for using emotes to openand unlock channels in an effort to simplify the channels a new user will first encounter 
@Artakush comments on furthering this idea by gaming it and creating more freedom, and gives discourse on how it can be incentivized by hooking into the things that push users to participate in different ways.  

@Audo makes a request for a future meeting of a deep look into Discord, discord bot, and KMD channel specifically.  

@Churro suggests that on the introduction part of joining discord server there could be a form that users fill out giving feedback on thier interests to help guide them to channels and areas that can be a part of their starting template when they start on KMD discord.  Also usable elsewhere.  


@joe_land1 suggests adding meta-categories to the discord onboarding process.

Comments on KMD portal site

@Artakush comments that people aren't there and it isn't as practical as it could be 

@sakata comments that the idea to scroll so far is a negative for engagment, and encourages the use of empty space

@Jcharming asks some questions targeting 'Why was the tripe portal solution chosen?"  
@Audo clarifies succinctly some of the criterea that was taken into consideration which lead to the decision to use tripe.  
1) live vs static content is the major issue and discord can have no static content

2) being able to do topic oriented topics that have a reply and ask format 

creating private spaces that helps empower users to find 'their' space as opposed to going to someone elses space that they have no ownership over to discuss.  

It seems like with discourd being a great solution for Dyanmic community engagment, the search is on to find the best 'static' engagement.  Where documentation can be saved for long term review.  Something 1 part stackoverflow, 1 part wiki, 1 part reddit, and 1 part medium.  

@Jcharming asks to have the weekend to explore Discourse and come back on Monday to share.  

@Churro comments on a lack of interactivity which leads to a loss of feeling for connection with it and other people

@Jack. apologies for joining late <3
(ps we were talking about rock climbing pre meetings) 

@Audo talks about using DICUSS as one of the options to explore.


[14-Aug-20 10:17 AM] Jcharming#2693
@sakata suggests a widget for discourse that lets blog posts be shown on discourse.  
@Artakush using something called restream.io to bring more cross functionality to platforms that are being explored.   
Also makes a suggestion to build a blockchain or decentralized social platforms because it marry's the quality content that KMD produces with something that holds our values in the decentralized and crypto space.  
@Audo does comment that it's a good idea, and that it may be difficult to add an additional project like this atm for an immediate solution

@Jcharming suggests to streamline the process to do a signup for discourse that is either incentivized from discord or part of the onboard process.  
@Churro adds that from experience using LBC who offers rewards and incentives for joining and participating/engaging with the LBC


[14-Aug-20 10:19 AM] Jcharming#2693
**request for next time**

Audo wants us to have 10-15 minutes to share and stream a portal or community project. 
it can be a platform, or forum, or a community we are a part of.


[14-Aug-20 10:19 AM] Jcharming#2693
5 min walk through and allow 5-10 mins


[14-Aug-20 10:19 AM] sakata#4279
^We should share what we are researching to stop conflict 🙂
