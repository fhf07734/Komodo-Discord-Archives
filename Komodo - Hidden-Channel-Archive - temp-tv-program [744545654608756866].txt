This is a temporary channel for the upcoming TV program on Thursday.

> On TV program on next thursday at 20:00 in GMT+3, ƒ∞stanbul, the theme will be Bitcoin revolution and Blockchain. I will talk about Komodo whereever possible. I want to use AtomicDex pro during program to show how people can send money to anywhere in the world. I will send and receive Komodo and MCL. I will also try atomic swap between them. Anyone who can join from other countries? One from far east one from USA or European countries could be very nice. We will have live connection. We can make tests before the program.

The idea is to showcase how we can send crypto payments across the world. Total time ~5-10 min. To join you will need to have a webcam and quality microphone, and of course AtomicDEX wallet with some KMD & MLC in it.

The program is in Turkish, but I would imagine this segment is in English. @B. G√ºltekin √áetiner will have the details.

So far interested people:
 - @TonyL , and also promised to give basic tech support if needed
 - @ca333 , I am sure CA would like to say few words about the AtomicDEX wallet too if that's possible
 - @PTYX

[16-Aug-20 08:25 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Thanks.


[16-Aug-20 08:30 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
@Audo Sure. It will be good if @ca333 would explain AtomicDex in a few words.


[16-Aug-20 08:32 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Can we make an audio discussion before thursday on what to talk and what to do? It may be wednesday.


[16-Aug-20 08:37 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Basically I can send/receive some MCL and Komodo to/from several countries. We can talk how communities could create their blockchains freely with Komodo and list on atomicdex. I am planning to start an atomicswap at the beginning of program. I hope it will finish by the end of program which takes 50 minutes.


[18-Aug-20 03:10 PM] Audo#5667
Ok, let's review the plan. What time on Wednesday is good for you?


[19-Aug-20 04:41 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Any time you wish. You can arrange the time.


[19-Aug-20 06:16 AM] Audo#5667
@B. G√ºltekin √áetiner what do the participants need to have ready?

 - webcam
 - microphone
 - AtomicDEX Mobile with KMD & MLC (so can show the mobile to to the webcam)
 - Address to send the funds to during the live program

Anything else?

Do you need some support or anything from our side?


[19-Aug-20 06:26 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Could Skype be used for live connection? I will install atomicdex in studio and send a wallet address. I will send some MCL and KMD and receive also. That is enough. I will make atomic swap then myself. Later we will have more time in other programs. We will have a Special program for komodo later.


[19-Aug-20 06:30 AM] Audo#5667
sounds good!

I don't know about the best option for live connection. I think other choice is Google hangouts.

@TonyL do you have any recommendations? We will need a stable connection with no lag/issues


[19-Aug-20 06:30 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
I will go to studio early.


[19-Aug-20 06:30 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Tomorrow


[19-Aug-20 06:31 AM] Audo#5667
even Discord could be used (but sometimes there are issues on Discord). I like this option because you could tell the audience that you will make this test with "komodo community" and then show the Komodo Discord


[19-Aug-20 06:31 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Maybe it is better


[19-Aug-20 06:32 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
There is no need for installing. We can use from browser directly


[19-Aug-20 06:33 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
You can also mention Komodo Discord channel to Turkish audience with qr code


[19-Aug-20 06:53 AM] TonyL#3577

[19-Aug-20 06:55 AM] TonyL#3577
@B. G√ºltekin √áetiner there is newer atomicdex-pro version (it's current 0.2.1 RC - you can download it if login into GH). I think it looks better than 0.2.0 and it might be worth to use this one for the demo:
https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-pro/actions/runs/214188334

(version will be updated until tomorrow most probably)

awesome @B. G√ºltekin √áetiner ! I want to see the episode :)

Would it be possible to get the recording over to us and we could upload it to Komodo youtube?

It was fantastic. We transferred money from/to Russia. And we also made AtomicSwap live. Atomicswap took half an hour. Yes we can provide recording. Do you need translation?


[20-Aug-20 12:56 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
We can have a separate program. The title may be ‚ÄúWhy Komodo?‚Äù We can make it as online panel with many participants from different locations. I can have no guest in studio in that program. It may be in English. We can have Turkish subtitles later.

if you can share it with english subtitles that's even better üëå

In the next TV program, we will go into mining and staking in blockchain systems. We are planning to demonstrate something live as in the last program. Any idea? We will talk about PoW and PoS and their importance. Definitely we can talk about notarization of other chains through dPoW. Sending/receiving coins to/from Russia last time created very good effect. What can we do similarly?


[24-Aug-20 08:52 AM] TonyL#3577
Hi professor @B. G√ºltekin √áetiner 
as an idea - http://komodo.zogs.org/ such interactive presentation might be interesting option

[24-Aug-20 10:09 AM] TonyL#3577
part of the content on it exact example is outdated (lets same Gamecredit is not notarising anymore, DICE assetchain is not opearting and etc) + it hangs time to time, so it's better to use as a ref. atm rather than actual presentation

[24-Aug-20 03:44 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Thanks. Is There source for it? So that we can translate into Turkish
