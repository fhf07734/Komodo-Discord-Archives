Hello. Is this related to ccl ? :)


[31-Aug-18 09:10 AM] SHossain#0007
i was thinking the same @Deleted User


[31-Aug-18 09:25 AM] barv#0867
Yes, this is CCL @Deleted User @SHossain


[31-Aug-18 09:26 AM] SHossain#0007
is CC an CCL the same? BCT forum thread mentions CC


[31-Aug-18 09:27 AM] barv#0867
Yep. The ticker will be CC. The AC is named CCL to not be confused with crypto conditions

what's the difference between coincollect and hyperdex?


[31-Aug-18 11:25 AM] PTYX#6840
is it just the mobile feature?


[31-Aug-18 11:53 AM] Meyse#0952
@PTYX for now we focus only on mobile, with trading function like shapeshift but then of course running on barterdex


[31-Aug-18 11:55 AM] Meyse#0952
LPnodes take a percentage, which will flow back to the CC coin holders


[31-Aug-18 11:59 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
will you work first on the gui, while the mm2.0 is in preparation, or will try using the existing core?


[31-Aug-18 11:59 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
from what I read 2.0 is really needed for mobile


[31-Aug-18 12:22 PM] barv#0867
We'll start off with existing core


[31-Aug-18 12:25 PM] barv#0867
The main difference @PTYX , is that we keep the average mobile user in mind. They want to be able to buy stuff easily .

Congratulations! This is actually what we need for cryptos to be part of our daily life. Can we add Turkish Liras into system? How? There is already one exchange in Turkey buying/selling TRY vs KMD. I met ceo of another exchange today. I suggested him to add not only Komodo but also other Komodo based coins/tokens to exchange with TRY. We will meet with them soon. If anything is needed for this let me know.

Thanks @B. G√ºltekin √áetiner ! If there are existing fiat gateways (like you mention) than yes. Our ambition is to integrate some existing fiat gateway for each country. Mostly fiat <> BTC  presume, but you can swap once  you entered the crypto world. fiat <> KMD would be cool. We should be in contact about Turkey defnitely!

I got a few questions by the way.

1. When is token sale
2. Do you have an estimate of percentages? Say if I held $1000 of CC tokens, how much volume would need to move through the DEX to award me with $1000 worth of kmd?
3. Is this pretty much just a mobile version of the Barterdex? How are you making the fees? From memory Barterdex has around .15% fee already. Did you get permission from KMD to use those fees towards rewards? Or how are you able to offer the fees at bdex rates as well as rewarding CC holders? üòÆ 
4. You mention LP node margins. So do you plan on being a LP to a range of coins and using those margins to payout to CC holders?


[02-Sep-18 01:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
Does this mean youll pretty much make as many decent coin pairings as possible, offer a mobile dex, market so people use it and buy off your LP node orders, then use the 3% coin profit to trade back to kmd to pay out rewards, which will in turn mean more kmd -> altcoin pairings and liquidity?


[02-Sep-18 01:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
Also if I understand correctly " and collect more of them in a secure way" might be better to write "be able to claim rewards/gas yourself as you are the only one in control of your own private keys"


[02-Sep-18 09:10 AM] barv#0867
@Seko we will make a generic interface so we can easily integrate gateways. We'll start with gateways we know in NL & Germany. Feel free to submit you're preferred ones. Ideally they allow you to directly send funds to your own wallet.

@Deleted User 1. We're in private sale mode now (second round) >> The price for the second round is set to ‚Ç¨0,0167 (1.67 cent) per CC. We aim for ‚Ç¨100,000 for 6,000,000 CC coins per investor. We reserved 12M CC coins for this round.
The third round for the remaining 6M coins will start 2018 October 1st. CC coins will be priced ‚Ç¨0,03 (3 cents) each and sold in smaller batches. Leftovers will be sold public via liquidity providers for ‚Ç¨0,04 to ‚Ç¨0,05 (4 to 5 cents).


[02-Sep-18 09:18 AM] barv#0867
2. If you invest in the second round, you will earn ~$1000 per month for every ~$1000 invested if we enjoy 500k to 600k active users


[02-Sep-18 09:20 AM] barv#0867
3. We use BarterDEX protocol. There is a GUI part integrated in the fee of BarterDEX (10% of the 0,15%) which we get. Next to that we earn on promotions in the app and on spread with optimised LP nodes


[02-Sep-18 09:21 AM] barv#0867
4. > spot on


[02-Sep-18 09:23 AM] barv#0867
I don't get this one  "be able to claim rewards/gas yourself as you are the only one in control of your own private keys" so you would need to explain. What we mean is that app users can collect their bags full of coins without ever needing third party trust. So it's not about the rewards.

As CoinCollect is a decentralised team building an interface on blockchains & just enabling users to utilise BarterDEX, there will be no #KYC beyond fiat gateways whatsoever.  Move over Shapeshift ü§ì


[06-Sep-18 02:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
@barv  sorry if stupid questions, but did you guys get license/approval for fiat gateways in certain countries? Or are you just using existing gateways somehow and integrating them into your app?


[06-Sep-18 02:40 AM] Deleted User#0000
Very interested in how this will play out, but not sure if throwing pretty much 100%+ of my stack of kmd into presale is worth it üò¢  Love me my kmd. But I will give my support once the normal sale goes live üòõ


[06-Sep-18 02:41 AM] barv#0867
Good question. We are using existing gateways, so these will be different in each country. We will make it feel like integrated. So these gateways perform KYC/AML like they all do

Ok now I understand. I might have to wait for round 3. That's too much kmd to part ways with for me

Hi here :).
Barterlly is now open on BETA mode, and will provide tools for users and CoinOwners to perform OTC trades in a safe way.
Any KMD assetchain dPowed will be listed, and supported, for free.
Other coins not already listed can submit a listing application at : https://barterlly.typeform.com/to/iqpS1H
During the BETA, Barterlly won't charge any fee other than the transaction ones. after the release we will charge 1% on top of every transaction.
