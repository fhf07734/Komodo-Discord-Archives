That Julian Assange rots in jail guilty of nothing, no charges, no conviction, no truth but not in the evil empires of China or Russia, only in the free UK by the free USA? Political science, just like any other science, wrong until proved right or right until proved wrong. No Politics is a good measure today, entertained to death anyway, all the best and good luck.

[30-Jan-22 08:03 AM] Exile13#4458
Would your ideas still be valuable?


[30-Jan-22 08:03 AM] Exile13#4458
Somethings valued when it's used


[30-Jan-22 08:03 AM] Exile13#4458
And sometimes we can only ascribe this value


[30-Jan-22 08:05 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
Don't confuse that I may or may not like the new thing with my feeling that the new thing shouldn't be called the old thing
My "problem" isn't the end result, in and of itself, but rather that it fundamentally changes the nature of the thing so much so that there are no remnants of the thing that brought me here.
I stand to gain no less than a small fortune from the new thing, but that doesn't mean that I don't prefer the ideology of the original thing


[30-Jan-22 08:06 AM] Exile13#4458
Can CC be made comparable to EVM in your opinion


[30-Jan-22 08:06 AM] Exile13#4458

[30-Jan-22 08:08 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
take the unclaimed rewards issue, for example:
every $1 taken from dmitry's mining is a $1 better *for me* in my pocket
that doesn't change the fact that I believe *he earned that $1* and should keep it

Is this not answerable?


[30-Jan-22 08:10 AM] Exile13#4458
Did I phrase it incorrectly


[30-Jan-22 08:12 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
I'd actually have to look deeper in the concept of EVM to answer
but, my now answer is:
> Why do we care? If we convert Komodo into a pseudo-Ethereum then what's the "special" thing about Komodo vs Ethereum? An apple isn't different than an orange just because it's a better orange, it's an apple and *not* an orange.


[30-Jan-22 08:13 AM] Exile13#4458
It's the usability


[30-Jan-22 08:13 AM] Exile13#4458
We create tech to make our lives simpler


[30-Jan-22 08:13 AM] Exile13#4458
Some enjoy building


[30-Jan-22 08:14 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
fundamentally changing the entirety of a thing so that *part* of the thing can function like some competitor's thing is still fundamentally changing the entirety of the thing

Not all need to know how the sun works to receive its benefits


[30-Jan-22 08:15 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
true but we lose all the benefits of it being a star if we stop it from being a star and turn it into an asteroid


[30-Jan-22 08:16 AM] Exile13#4458
I don't think we could turn kmd into a plummeting rock


[30-Jan-22 08:17 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
let me put it this way:
What good is THC as THC if you scrap all notion of tracking hemp and make it all about competing with LUMBER for tracking wood?


[30-Jan-22 08:17 AM] Exile13#4458
You will be able to track many things with HempTRAC


[30-Jan-22 08:17 AM] Exile13#4458
The thing about making devices, is that you don't get to decide what they are used for


[30-Jan-22 08:18 AM] Exile13#4458
You can try, but forcing is fascism


[30-Jan-22 08:18 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
the name "HempTRAC" loses all meaning when you make it specifically *not* about hemp and take all hemp stuff out of it


[30-Jan-22 08:19 AM] Exile13#4458
Is a rose still a rose regardless of moniker?

yes, a rose sandwich still tastes like roses if you call it a "dog shit sandwich" but that doesn't mean I want to buy a "dog shit sandwich"

> It must adapt to survive
by destroying its unique ease of process and concept, thus making it just another thing in a line of carbon copy things

Took me 10hrs to get a nspv server up


[30-Jan-22 08:26 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
Let me flip it around this way:
If Komodo becomes a thing chasing Ethereum to be like Ethereum, then why do I not just want Ethereum?


[30-Jan-22 08:26 AM] Exile13#4458
Didn't kmd fork from zec?


[30-Jan-22 08:26 AM] Exile13#4458
Why don't I want zec?


[30-Jan-22 08:27 AM] Exile13#4458
I can't tell you what to want


[30-Jan-22 08:27 AM] Exile13#4458
That's not the reason why we make things


[30-Jan-22 08:27 AM] Exile13#4458
We make things to be used


[30-Jan-22 08:27 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
to make it different from zcash, not to follow the path of zcash


[30-Jan-22 08:27 AM] Exile13#4458
Exactly


[30-Jan-22 08:28 AM] Exile13#4458
There's no possibility that kmd can be eth or Anything like


[30-Jan-22 08:28 AM] Exile13#4458
We bridge to ETH, fek


[30-Jan-22 08:28 AM] Exile13#4458
Does eth do this?


[30-Jan-22 08:28 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
but, this isn't that
this isn't "we want a unique thing"
this is the *opposite* of that
this is "we want to be exactly like *that* thing"


[30-Jan-22 08:29 AM] Exile13#4458
No


[30-Jan-22 08:29 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
yes


[30-Jan-22 08:29 AM] Exile13#4458
We like their capabilities


[30-Jan-22 08:29 AM] Exile13#4458
So we take a dance move


[30-Jan-22 08:30 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
that's the dex project
I'm talking komodo (the project)


[30-Jan-22 08:30 AM] Exile13#4458
Right which is just one of the things that is unique

Question: why would you like to see EVM functionality on Komodo?


[30-Jan-22 08:32 AM] Exile13#4458
Stablecoin


[30-Jan-22 08:32 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
bear in mind, everything (work wise) that got me to stay was bdex, so this isn't "I hate the dex" or anything like that
I'm talking about the core fundamentals of what got me to want to care about komodo as a thing
it's hard to not intertwine the projects, I know


[30-Jan-22 08:33 AM] Exile13#4458
I understand


[30-Jan-22 08:33 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
iirc there was some kind of stablecoin CC (or plans for it)


[30-Jan-22 08:33 AM] Exile13#4458
Was?


[30-Jan-22 08:33 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
No. Why?
> Stablecoin
Why?


[30-Jan-22 08:33 AM] Exile13#4458
This is my question... what's up with cc?


[30-Jan-22 08:33 AM] Exile13#4458
Can it be dev'd to be compatible with web3


[30-Jan-22 08:34 AM] Exile13#4458
Because NDA


[30-Jan-22 08:34 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
If we want to change CC, that's a different topic than changing the core of komodo itself and everything about it


[30-Jan-22 08:35 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
CC is a small part of a larger whole


[30-Jan-22 08:35 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
To quote Grewal: komodo tech is in CC PoC state....
In other words: it's proven to be possible, but not developed into a market...


[30-Jan-22 08:35 AM] Exile13#4458
Proof of concept


[30-Jan-22 08:35 AM] Exile13#4458
So it needs battery testing?


[30-Jan-22 08:36 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
Bear in mind: I janked that quote out of context. It does not apply to all tech...


[30-Jan-22 08:36 AM] Exile13#4458
How many devs do we need


[30-Jan-22 08:36 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
CC didn't even start until after komodo was a thing
CC was adapted to the thing
not the other way round
and certainly not changing everything about the thing to make CC the thing


[30-Jan-22 08:38 AM] Exile13#4458
Whatever the words or functions are, what does kmd need, how many people and time are needed to dev out what the community is asking for? Web3 interaction so it's easy to use the things we make?


[30-Jan-22 08:39 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
I'll never disagree with adding things/functions
my issue is changing the core of the thing so that the **whole** thing is an entirely different thing


[30-Jan-22 08:40 AM] Exile13#4458
So you don't know? I've asked twice, just for your opinion on this.


[30-Jan-22 08:40 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
of the proposed things in #general, what of komodo actually remains if all are adopted?


[30-Jan-22 08:40 AM] Exile13#4458
I figured you would have a good idea


[30-Jan-22 08:40 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
I do, and the answer is:
"nothing"


[30-Jan-22 08:41 AM] Exile13#4458
So nothing is needed


[30-Jan-22 08:41 AM] Exile13#4458
Kmd doesn't need any changes or updates

@Waldemar point me to any single day in the last 8 years where Ukraine honored the self-governance of Donetsk......


[04-Mar-22 08:20 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
I'll wait.......


[04-Mar-22 08:23 AM] Waldemar#9727
how the hell does it matter? Russia involment in Donetsk affairs is as shitty as usa involvment everywhere else in the world


[04-Mar-22 08:24 AM] JimD#9272
The Ukraine shills are delusional.  Zelensky overplayed his hand and is getting wrecked


[04-Mar-22 08:27 AM] Waldemar#9727
And if you really want to go back in history read about Holodomor and forcefull movement of ppl of ZSRR republics they where evil then and nothing changed after all those years.


[04-Mar-22 08:28 AM] Waldemar#9727
No sane country recognised Donetsk independence anyway


[04-Mar-22 08:28 AM] JimD#9272
The life of an Eastern European amounts to making deals with the more powerful devils around.  At this point in history NATO is Devil A and Russia is Devil B


[04-Mar-22 08:30 AM] JimD#9272
I wish everyone the best but its gonna get worse before it gets better.  We are going to see WW2 tactics with fairly modern weapons and its going to turn into a bloodbath at some point


[04-Mar-22 08:31 AM] JimD#9272
Being a non-aligned buffer state was the correct choice that would of saved the most lives.  Counting on Vlad not to be a dick was foolish


[04-Mar-22 08:31 AM] JimD#9272
Also assuming the west would send in ground troops against a top nuclear power was a bad gamble


[04-Mar-22 08:36 AM] Waldemar#9727
How NATO is devil in this situation is beyond me. Killing civilians, shooting planes and sinking ships is on Russia side.


[04-Mar-22 08:37 AM] JimD#9272
Just because someone is not taking your pieces on a chessboard does not mean they are not improving their position to do so.


[04-Mar-22 08:37 AM] JimD#9272
the Russians are not stupid


[04-Mar-22 08:37 AM] Waldemar#9727
this is not a chess game, ppl are dying


[04-Mar-22 08:38 AM] JimD#9272
not the people that are playing the game unfortunately


[04-Mar-22 08:40 AM] JimD#9272
I hope its over soon.  This is the most  dangerous time since maybe the Cuban missile crisis.  A lot can go wrong and escalate


[04-Mar-22 08:42 AM] Waldemar#9727
Lets hope that putain is not stupid enough to do something drastic

They want the pipelines too.  NATO/Russia both want to supply gas to Europe and Ukraine has a lot of pipes

ü§´ you're not supposed to know that the last 50 years of war was over gas/oil


[04-Mar-22 08:51 AM] JimD#9272
the way you fight Russia is to lower the price of gas to where their oil wells become unprofitable


[04-Mar-22 08:51 AM] JimD#9272
that was the cornerstone of Reagans strategy to defeat the USSR

History is history, and likely as muddy as the info we have fed into our eyes 24/7 in the modern age. It's not excuses, but it can offer insights to contributing causes. 
One thing I never understood is how RU was an ally that took massive damage helping defeat the Nazis in WW2 but rarely gets a mention in our books, and then somehow ended up how it is today.
It's far from perfect, but so are we, and sadly actions since 9/11 have slowly but surely eroded much of the moral high ground we once held. This high ground used to come in useful.
Those most damaged are never the ones making the decisions or talking tough on TV / internet.

Russia don't get recognition for ww2 in the west mainly because there were no different then nazis, Katyn massacre, Holodomor, Gulags etc... Sure they helped, to finish Nazis off, but also brought as much suffering or even more than them. Strangest part is that most of the suffering were done by their own ppl.

It's a shot in the foot. Inside the country, these cards will work, but there will be no more trust in the system. Russia has its own payment system "MIR" and Unionpay will be used for external purchases.


[06-Mar-22 12:36 AM] SadykovT#2123
It is also a signal to other countries that they can be disconnected from the service at any time.


[06-Mar-22 02:16 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
It doesn't seem to be a shot in the foot because it will not hurt western countries but at the same time it makes impossible for Russians to use their Visa or Mastercard abroad. 
You are right - it is a clear message to other dictators: do not invade other countries & do not bombard their cities & do not kill women and children.  If you do so, you will be punished.

btw, a real shot in the foot is destroying one's own country economy in just 10 days.

Every country that is invading another is to blame for their crimes.
BTW, In Syria Russia is also doing their job.

I'm not happy that ordinary Russians that do not support this war will suffer just because one guy decided to start the killing.

Imagine that you, your wife and kids are just being bombarded. Do not be heartless. Maybe you will stop telling that it is about politics.

It's not a rocket science: one country invaded another (weaker & smaller) and started the killing. 
As I already said `Every country that is invading another is to blame for their crimes.`

Are you saying that the situation in the self-proclaimed ‚ÄúDonetsk Republic‚Äù and ‚ÄúLuhansk Republic" are the reason to start a full-fledged war against Ukraine? btw, Donetsk and Luhansk are really small regions in eastern Ukraine.
