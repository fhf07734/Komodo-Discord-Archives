Our community requested a 'business-dev' channel and @nelg from the business dev team agreed it's a good idea and will be monitoring the channel to answer questions.


[11-Jul-18 12:42 PM] Regnar#6164
Awesome. So this is the primary business dev channel on discord, is it secondary to another public channel somewhere else? or has bus dev been private so far?


[11-Jul-18 04:27 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Pretty much private so far


[11-Jul-18 04:56 PM] Regnar#6164
Okay so what type of information can we expect to be updated here? or is this just for community to suggest business ideas

**Contacts to Blockchain areas of consulting firms**

Consulting firms are where businesses turn to rent brain power. When they don‚Äôt know how to approach something, don‚Äôt know if there is a better way to do something, don‚Äôt know if they can truly implement something (like a blockchain) they turn to consultants. They don‚Äôt turn to blockchain companies to ask if it works, because that‚Äôs like asking a car salesman if you need a car. So getting in with some consulting firms would be crucial. 

Consulting firms are looking for cutting edge ways to bring value to their clients, a Komodo official partnership with them could give them the tools to recommend blockchain products to their clients, these firms aren‚Äôt going to recommend building on a platform they don‚Äôt know or trust, because they are in the business of being right, not throwing ideas at a wall. 

Here‚Äôs some blockchain focused contacts at the top consulting firms in the United States and World

^^^I think this guy might be the best bet to go to first. He's young and labels himself cryptocurrency lead at EY on his twitter, and cryptoasset leader on linkedin. This is a big step up for the other roles which are "blockchain" and try to avoid the crypto part. He may be more receptive to hearing us out, and he actually has experience with integrating blockchains into businesses.

The US government also uses these consulting firms to decide on how to implement new technology. Booz Allen Hamilton is very big in government contracts and consulting as 1/3rd of their entire work force are military veterans. One strong avenue of approach would be to try and target products to the GSA.

The GSA acts as the primary procurement and distribution branch for most government agencies for supplies. Including the military. It seems Booz Allen Hamilton is probably the go to consulting firm dealing with US gov. Anything with NSN can be procured through GSA, they are the big ones.
Which means they are big in the contracting business and the audit, tracking, and verification of contracts could easily be suited for blockchains. Problem is we'd be going against probably IBM. But that hasn't stopped Factom or other blockchain companies from securing DHS contracts and grants (though Factom has a foundation based in Texas which is similar to how I figured we‚Äôd structure the Komodo entity)

Great idea,  been thinking about applications that can utilize the tps capability that KMD is building. For instance;  How many txt msgs/emails are there per second in the world?  how many unique instances of some sort of conditional data exchange  occur at or near this rate.?... I'm assuming that kmd will be first to demonstrably prove this tps capability. Need to do more research, just food for thought.

It would be better to compare our scaling solution to ERC20's on ETH, i.e each ERC20 can scale on its own, rather than use the ETH blockchain. The design of the system enable's it to scale to infinity, as long as the Internet has enough bandwidth and computers to handle the transactions. I think James stated it as "limited by the capacity of the entire internet" 
You can make chain clusters, with MoMoM so that a bunch of chains act as one single giant chain, and you can send transactions from one chain to another.  But creating one giant cluster that has all transactions in the world on it, kind of defeats the purpose of designing a system like this. To do that why not just make one blockchain with 1Gb blocks?

@Deleted User  Erc20 tx data onchain,  it's more like colored coins than independent chains,  current "mineable " eth token assets are like  NXTs custom currencies .   To answer your question, clusters or even a big cluster allows for partitioning different segments of the network based off of function .   For example ,  with KBS  a cluster of 3 chains, one for debt recording , one for credit recording and one for vouchers.  The first an ac_private=1 chain , to keep private people's debt the 2nd an ac_public=1 chain,  to allow trading among network participants,  and the 3rd utilizing burn protocol with the 2nd so that consumers can participate without joining.  Having each isolated prevents potential congestion based mishaps.  I expect the third to have a lot more tx volume than the other 2 .  However, actions on the other two are the ones that are required to be reported.

Hey guys, would there be possibility to make "more smart icos" using our DEX? More smart I mean - currently ICOs are more or less " give us all money right now, so we start the product production". But another possibility like could be very interesting for investors: money locked in smart contract, and pay while most investors (or bigest holders - options) agree. If no agreement reached for some defined period -> money sent back to investors wallet (+possibility to define different address then incoming address). So that only the first ICO part would be paid to start the business, and investors could agree to pay the rest BTC while the first part is successfully delivered (which is confirmed by investors vote. This requires that New Token XXX and investors BTC are frozen, and only exchanged after voting/agreement using some kind of smart contract. sth like that if it make sense? I believe it requires very big trust to give all money right away. Investing using partial payments seems more reasonable. Ofcourse this could be done without smart contracts, but  ICO owners must have some warrant theere are some BTC waiting frozen and will be paid after doing the job. Does it make sense ?

Basically a bridge loan with the next rounds approved assuming different milestones are met. Private equity often does this when they make intermittent investments in a firm to reach certain development or growth targets. I can't see why this wouldn't be possible, but there may be a subjective aspect of this. It would be a good idea though, especially for institutional investors. It's a great idea


[16-Jul-18 11:53 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I don't think ICO are the way to push forward with the tech.  At least not the kind we have seen in crypto.  Registered securities is another story


[16-Jul-18 12:30 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
@polycryptoblog  most ICOs to me currently is like buying  a pig in a poke. So having the possibility to make it in rounds could be a way of introducing more reliable projects funding and more trusted investor-developer relation? But also this mechanism could be used maybe for other purposes. Personally I would trust more a project that will take money in rounds after reaching milstones. However this requires also a platform for discussions and voting - and here we land back into my old propaganda - that what internet folks need most currently is decent secure voting online + a real decent forum engine. So that people can well discuss (or more like "process knowledge together" in an optimal way). BTW discussing is a kind of game, which optimal rules (discussion cycles, source linking, weighing knowledge sources, topics and common interest validation) maybe are not yet defined at all.


[16-Jul-18 02:28 PM] Regnar#6164
"Personally I would trust more a project that will take money in rounds after reaching milestones." same. and I think a lot of investors think the same. when it comes to voting it would be fairly simple to airdrop votes to the holders (though pretty sure this would make them securities) which is useful if a project has taken money from N amount of investors.


[16-Jul-18 02:29 PM] Regnar#6164
I think there is a fine line with development and funding. too much funding and they are likely to squander it and spend frivolously on things they could have taken care of in house (think Daymond John, Power of Broke) and too little money and they obviously can't make ends meet. So the bridge concept is an effective one.


[16-Jul-18 02:39 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
Could be a good selling point. Long term this approach could be preferred also by law makers and this way propagated as a better way. Should be even this year many people crying for bad ICOs to law makers.


[16-Jul-18 04:59 PM] Regnar#6164
yea I think it's a viable future fundraising requirement.


[16-Jul-18 05:00 PM] Regnar#6164
though it would take some tweaking to make the additional funding more objective upon completion of milestones


[16-Jul-18 05:04 PM] n2okpride#1967
I suggested something similar awhile back when Vitalik first proposed his DAICO model - built in voting of funds being released, as well as a vote option for full refund if certain development milestones or promises were not met


[16-Jul-18 05:04 PM] n2okpride#1967
would be a custom solution that needs to be built. but i still think it is a needed solution the industry needs.

[17-Jul-18 04:16 AM] Regnar#6164
I'm not sure about the refund model, seeing as most investors would prefer the money they give to a business actually be spent and used to achieve the goals of the business. Investors, at least institutional investors, don't give money to a company so it sits on it, gambles with it, or anything else non operational, they give it so the company spends it on what's needed to achieve growth. 

Having a refund button for stages of funding probably won't work. that money is gone.


[17-Jul-18 04:19 AM] Regnar#6164
obviously this is different than simply raising money initially, if they raise enough in a single round they may not need spend it all and a refund could be necessary, but again, that's the whole point of staged fundraising, so that only increments of investor money is at risk at a time and only enough money is given to fund up to the next milestone. It is also incentive for legitimate projects to develop. This could root out a lot of scam projects but there is still the risk of a scam taking the initial funding, or "developing" in private and saying they met goals but that's why we verify.


[17-Jul-18 08:24 AM] n2okpride#1967
a refund could only be initiated if a high majority vote of all contributors agreed, and i'm sure it would also be stake weighted. this was only in an extreme case, and wouldn't be on a per user basis.

@BlackJesus, KMD and NEM existed long before ARDR was even in the works and both IOTA and Waves existed before ARDR was off of test net, and may have been around before there was talk of ARDR as well. I lived most of NXT's history with a 1 year gap where I stopped paying attention to crypto all together (which is why I am not sure about Waves and IOTA, they were released during that year I wasn't paying attention).

On an unrelated note, I have a business solution proof-of-concept I want to build. Does anyone have connections with blockchain savvy Golang and/or QTscript developers who may be interested?

I can start the project by myself, but it will take forever for me to finish without some help.

I don't have a budget set yet, but I would like to develop to connections early.


[27-Jul-18 01:41 PM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
@PTYX, was looking at Chainzilla, seems interesting. Seems a lot like the kind of business I want to launch with the proof of concept. You guys are one step ahead of me.


[27-Jul-18 01:45 PM] CryptoFoxGaming#5228
I have a tendency to to always be 10 steps ahead and unable to advance due to lack of interest or 1 step behind because I wait too long for the interest to build before advancing.

Perhaps joining up with Chainzilla would be my best move. I have been involved with cryptocurrency and blockchain since late 2013 or early 2014 and I can program backend in Java and Golang.

being early days, maybe license chainzilla tech or have a business agreement where they do the tech work and you mange your own customers - on both sides, backend and customer management, a lot of education and double up work.  i know with pioneers we can do 80% of the work, but in reality, the 20% will be  exhausting.  pty is looking to be the redhat of blockchain service providers.  if 10 blockchain projects wanted to onboard with zilla at the same time, maybe they can't handle the education component.  plenty of growth in the future - providing best service to end customers in education and consulting is the best way.


[19-Aug-18 06:50 PM] Mylo#8306
and no offence to zilla, if they can handle 10 all at once, then maybe i meant 30.  at some point there is finite human resources to handle the work.  as early adopters of the tech, no point cutting each other's grass.  so many services to be built on and around the tech.


[20-Aug-18 07:50 AM] PTYX#6840
We couldn't handle more than 5 at a time right now


[20-Aug-18 07:52 AM] PTYX#6840
A year from now I expect to be able to handle 10 at a time or more once the marketing tools we are working on are ready. Community, marketing, and PR seems to be a huge part of the success of a project so we have to provide solutions within the scope of ICO. If there isn't an ICO involved we can definitely handle 30

Hi, i'm new to the Komodo community, besides Smart Contracts in the way, i was wondering if there was any plan for CDN, Hardware or Mining rental for blockchains developed with Komodo?, if so, new developers could deploy their solution in minutes and start injecting FIAT to the community of Komodo miners, i think it will make Komodo the most notable equihash coin without removing complete autonomy to the new blockchains created on Komodo. With all the equihash power of ASIC and GPU in the community, renting Sol/h and Gb to developers in a descentralizad manner seems pretty interesting and will make the new blockchains much more cheap to deploy and scale initially, at least until the coin gets enough value to attract miners. If the blockchain gains traction Komodo gains by retaining some of the coins, if not, the solution may still be useful and applied for the final users and will get some FIAT besides dPOW and Trading. In essence all you need to implement this is a balancer structure that redirects miners to different Blockchains accordingly, and the automated payments of course.


[26-Aug-18 08:51 PM] Prado#3941
Komodo is the more powerful and flexible Blockchain development platform i have seen but its been opaqued by the easy to use and popularity of NEM, Stellar and others (at least in my initial investigation),  i would love to help with my team to make it happen, pay KMD to deploy in a click the infrastructure rented for your blockchain solution, dPOW makes it maybe the only platform that could make this right now, as renting a couple miners for your solution without dPOW will be dangerous for most DAPPs in an open blockchain. Also it could help automatize almost all the current revenue model of Komodo making the coin even more Liquid.

As komodo attracts more h/s will the rewards would be adjusted to show the current security of the network? Example: if all equihash coins make a hardfork to protect from current ASIC there will be Th/s of ASIC available for komodo,  this could make the external dPOW less necessary and save a lot money in BTC attracting more developers, miners and even other blockchains (as the dPOW would be much more cheap and faster) also it will inject more FIAT as mining (or Holding) wouldn't  be the best option to pay for the dPOW in a competitive scenario like that, also hash power could be rented to protect small chains between dPOWs (injecting even more FIAT from developers, startups and organizations), 10 minutes its a small lapse of time to hit komodo, but its enough to ruin most dAPPs, ICOs or Smart Contracts logics and structure. It will contain all projects in consortium and private or semi private structures forever, removing some of the best properties of owning your own open, exchange capable, minable and personalizable blockchain


[28-Aug-18 12:41 AM] jl777c#5810

first off, ZEC is unlikely to fork

let's just take one step at a time


[28-Aug-18 12:42 AM] Prado#3941
we will be bringing at least 5 projects to komodo this year


[28-Aug-18 12:42 AM] Prado#3941
as CTO of the projects i want to understand all pros and cons


[28-Aug-18 12:42 AM] jl777c#5810
current hashrate is relatively unchanged from prior to ASIC release


[28-Aug-18 12:43 AM] jl777c#5810
its fine to try to understand, but I think risky to make too many extrapolations


[28-Aug-18 12:43 AM] Prado#3941
Yeas i've seen that, ZEC it's attracting most of the hash power on the market


[28-Aug-18 12:43 AM] jl777c#5810
due to the (no) cost structure that KMD offers, I expect a lot of projects will use KMD, after all who likes to pay $5 txfees


[28-Aug-18 12:44 AM] Prado#3941
but i thing komodo is the future of equihash


[28-Aug-18 12:44 AM] jl777c#5810
until ZEC hashrate triples, I dont think KMD mining is better profitability and that is a lot of hashrate that is needed


[28-Aug-18 12:44 AM] Prado#3941
not zec


[28-Aug-18 12:44 AM] jl777c#5810
well, if KMD price goes up 3x, then it likely becomes the best thing to mine (for that day's ROI)


[28-Aug-18 12:45 AM] jl777c#5810
but it is very difficult to predict hashrates, market prices, across multiple coins


[28-Aug-18 12:46 AM] Prado#3941
ZEC wont fork as it would handle tons of hash rate to the only project that has notary as service business model


[28-Aug-18 12:47 AM] Prado#3941
But as more good coins and projects get to use komodo the proccess will be natural i think


[28-Aug-18 12:48 AM] jl777c#5810
I dont see 10 minute blocktimes, with removal of F4A period, we should get very consistent blocktimes all the time

if PoW mining is a concern, there is PoS, also combination of PoW/PoS.   In the future there is the possibility of not only equihash mining.

Depends on price, it would be stupid to have notaries mine 75% of blocks if KMD was $1000 for instance, IMO

per diff/hash KMD has to be 4x in value to any other coin to be equal in profitability


[01-Sep-18 10:34 AM] jl777c#5810
in other words when KMD is 10x current prices relative to the other coins, it would be 2.5x more profitable to mine than the others

notary nodes will be running full nodes of COIN and need to make transactions


[13-Sep-18 09:25 AM] dukeleto#7326
many projects are asking if they need to run their own notary nodes, they don't quite understand what KMD provides, so I am trying to explain it all in the "master kmd dpow" document


[13-Sep-18 09:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
this will hopefully prevent them wanting to implement dpow in ways that James already realized wouldn't work, and avoiding wasted time


[13-Sep-18 09:27 AM] PTYX#6840
We are sticking with 300 so it's not from us.


[13-Sep-18 09:30 AM] dukeleto#7326
we still need one more piece to really deliver "double spend attack prevention", and that is an API to query to answer the question "has this txid of COIN been notarized to KMD/BTC?"


[13-Sep-18 09:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's being worked on, James set a bounty. Without that, exchanges can't use and won't see the benefit of notarization data. And they are the ones forcing coins to implement this stuff, and making coins pay them back for double spends that happen on their exchanges(!)


[13-Sep-18 09:46 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Good stuff @dukeleto & all people working on it. Only reassures me in my view that kmd really is one of the, if not the best project out there.

@Malti I think it's possible to issue tickets as form of assetsCC tokens and even maybe create custom cryptoconditions smart contract contract for ticketing. Almost zero fees + dPOW protection - Komodo should be a good option for them

365 and 365 of the coin being notarized .  Also there is costs for integration,  but komodo assetchains have a severely reduced cost opposed to non kmd chains


[22-Nov-18 06:16 PM] PTYX#6840
No it's actually ~$2500  a year plus 365 KMD/365 Of the coin being notarized as per the new pricing plans. Is that correct @Audo ?


[22-Nov-18 06:20 PM] PTYX#6840
I'm not sure if the information has been released in a marketing fashion but I was given confirmation that the pricing was changed. That's what we have been communicating to our clients. Also, the price will slowly increase as more projects are added until a maximum cost is reached. The plan is to increase each time a new chain is added until we reach 100 chains. This will encourage projects to get added to dpow  asap.


[22-Nov-18 06:21 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
"Also the costs for integration" = fiatamount


[22-Nov-18 06:23 PM] PTYX#6840
There are already 2 projects in the pipeline that should be added in the next weeks. It's first come first serve. So if a project is added today, their price will stay the same for their anual renewal. It's in their best interest to be an early adopter of dpow. And Chainzilla is planning on strongly promoting dpow once the ico campaign is finished.

We need to stop adding coins to KMD notaries ... I have almost finished a second layer system, hopefully we get to test it well enough for KMDLABS so we cna use it ... this will drive down costs for dPoW a fair bit, and stop sacrificing KMD's security. We should not have hundreds of coins, ont he main KMD notaries... its just a bad idea.

It's STAKED rebranded. @Alright knows more üòÉ


[23-Nov-18 03:11 AM] Alright#0419
@Cryptoon it's a coin to incentivize testing smart contracts. Plan to be a resource that the whole ecosystem can use to iron out bugs in smart contracts before deploying them on production chains


[23-Nov-18 03:59 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And who incentivizes? What gives LABS a value? It will be kind of pegged back to kmd then?


[23-Nov-18 04:00 AM] Alright#0419
You can earn LABS by finding bugs in smart contracts, staking, mining or running a notary. We set up a system to where we can add contracts on the fly without the need for a hard fork. A contract dev can spin up a chain(only cost is notarization cost), people can test this chain, if a bug is found they will make a bounty claim. If enough notaries sign off on this bounty claim, they get the coins


[23-Nov-18 04:01 AM] Alright#0419
So contract dev can start a chain and have people test it for basically no cost the them


[23-Nov-18 04:02 AM] Alright#0419
here's a elevator pitch I typed up previously


[23-Nov-18 04:02 AM] Alright#0419
we'll have a website up with more info next week


[23-Nov-18 04:02 AM] Alright#0419
```
Purpose of STAKED is to give crypto condition contract devs a place to have their contracts tested. There is a problem in that a coin dev cannot just implement the first iteration of a new contract on a production coin as each bug could mean a hard fork.(think KMDICE the last couple weeks) What STAKED allows a dev to do is spin up a STAKED chain that is fungible with all other STAKED chains. They can have custom consensus rules or contracts. Testers can then be rewarded by finding bugs in these contracts. If there is a bug in the contract, they simply kill the chain, update the contract and start another chain.

STAKED will be the only asset chain with "opt-in contracts", meaning contracts are not compulsory consensus rules. In order to implement a contract on a typical assetchain, all nodes must update. On STAKED however, you simply add the contract to a new chain. If a user wants to use the contract, they sync the chain and transfer coins to it. If user isn't interested in the contract, they can simply ignore it. 
```


[23-Nov-18 04:03 AM] Alright#0419
replace STAKED with KMDLabs üòõ


[23-Nov-18 04:05 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Ok, the reason/need for a kmdlabs chain is clear, but what will give it value, as devs/testers will need to be incentivized to do testing?


[23-Nov-18 04:06 AM] Alright#0419
Couple interesting projects have cropped up on it already. @Deleted User created something called a "streamer" chain, which can be used to stream arbitrary files to a pemissioned chain that is then dpow'd to KMD. This allows for uncensorable streaming and if one copy of the chain exists, it can be proved that it is authentic. @smkhound is working on "DragonHound" which is a way for him to track his dog via GPS and post coordinates via oracles.


[23-Nov-18 04:07 AM] Alright#0419
I made the trollbox proof of concept as well, but that's not LABS specific. It's on chain real time chat. Think immutable decentralized discord.


[23-Nov-18 04:08 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm or people will need to buy kmdlabs to offer the reward to testers


[23-Nov-18 04:08 AM] Alright#0419
I'm not sure I have a clear cut answer for that @Cryptoon. If you just look at how much progress we've made in the past couple months, I think you would agree that it will have value


[23-Nov-18 04:08 AM] Cryptoon#3362
so buy/sell is in equilibrium


[23-Nov-18 04:09 AM] Alright#0419
They need to fund notaries with LABS


[23-Nov-18 04:09 AM] Alright#0419
That's it. Notaries can choose how much LABS they want before they begin to notarize someone's chain


[23-Nov-18 04:09 AM] Deleted User#0000
It will have value...  as its PoS (people love getting more coins) and it also directs heaps of contracts (that would likely all have their own coin like KMDICE) to ahve a single curency


[23-Nov-18 04:10 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Devil's advocate will ask if this does not give notaries too much power to decide whether or not something is tested enough or whatever


[23-Nov-18 04:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
and the BR is only 9 with 1 going to notary nodes.

there is nothing stopping someon (devs or anyone else) just starting another set of notary nodes to compete with is id we fo a bad job, por try and charge to much


[23-Nov-18 04:11 AM] Cryptoon#3362
can there be more sets of NN? As I thought NN pubkeys were hardcoded


[23-Nov-18 04:12 AM] Alright#0419
LABS is likely to have bleeding edge contracts before any other chain


[23-Nov-18 04:12 AM] Alright#0419
as we can add them on a whim unlike all other chains


[23-Nov-18 04:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
They are but I made it so you can have as many set of them as you like and stilll keep compatibility with KMD


[23-Nov-18 04:12 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Also, maybe as a last remark, is it a good idea to have inflation on the chain with staking, as this will diminish the value somewhat depending on the reward plan.


[23-Nov-18 04:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
could ahve 1000 sets of notary nodes ewach notarising a single chain, if you wanted to


[23-Nov-18 04:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
the idea is that, we have the knowhow and the community to provide the best/cheapest service over someone forking our code.


[23-Nov-18 04:13 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Let's say you offer 1M LABS to test whatever, and it takes 6 months for the contract to complete, but meanwhile the 1M labs has diminished in value because of staking rewards


[23-Nov-18 04:13 AM] Cryptoon#3362
devs will be incentivized less


[23-Nov-18 04:13 AM] Cryptoon#3362
because of this


[23-Nov-18 04:14 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Sorry for the questions, just the first things that pop up in my head, and I'm sure others will probably have similar questions, best to think about it ahead of launching everyhting


[23-Nov-18 04:16 AM] Alright#0419
Again, only cost to contract dev is paying notaries


[23-Nov-18 04:16 AM] Alright#0419
the bug bounties come from thin air and are part of the emissions themselves


[23-Nov-18 04:17 AM] Alright#0419
nothing to stop them from adding additional bounties to attract more testers, but it's not necessary


[23-Nov-18 04:17 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Ok, but again, that was my main question, what gives it value?


[23-Nov-18 04:17 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Why would someone pay kmd/btc/xxx for LABS?


[23-Nov-18 04:18 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Ok you can stake it for more LABS, but what does it matter if LABS itself doesnt really have value as it's created from thin air


[23-Nov-18 04:18 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Unless the notaries buy the LABS back to pay out later again etc


[23-Nov-18 04:19 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I'm probably missing something, but for now it doesnt really make sense to me, I'll think about it some more and come back if I have more questions


[23-Nov-18 04:19 AM] Alright#0419
You have a valid point. We're just having a hard time articulating our vision here


[23-Nov-18 04:20 AM] Alright#0419
Most of the mechanisms for it is not set in stone. Feel free to make suggestions


[23-Nov-18 04:20 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah I think that's the main thing. Important to think about a reason why LABS would have value.


[23-Nov-18 04:21 AM] Alright#0419
We see it as a vital resource for contract devs. Something we *need* as an ecosystem. We're still hashing out the specifics of emissions, incentives, general game theory


[23-Nov-18 04:21 AM] Cryptoon#3362
My gut feeling would be to make it 1M premine locked up somehow, that can be bought with kmd or whatever by people that want something tested


[23-Nov-18 04:21 AM] Cryptoon#3362
That way the devs being paid in LABS know it is backed by something


[23-Nov-18 04:22 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And will be incentivized that way to do the tests/work


[23-Nov-18 04:22 AM] Alright#0419
I don't quite understand


[23-Nov-18 04:22 AM] Alright#0419
please stop by #kmdlabs and explain your ideas


[23-Nov-18 04:23 AM] Alright#0419

[23-Nov-18 04:32 AM] smkhound#7640
I one thing thought LABS would do was allow incentivised testing, with bounties paid for bug fix etc. 
Project seeking testing buys some LABS for paying bounties, and users earn LABS for testing whatever they want tested


[23-Nov-18 04:33 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah if a project needed to buy LABS then my arguments are invalid, but alright said the LABS rewards would be created from thin air


[23-Nov-18 04:34 AM] Cryptoon#3362
What BTC gives value is someone asking 10.000 of them for a pizza.


[23-Nov-18 04:34 AM] Cryptoon#3362
If nobody is offering anything for the LABS they earn, then it doesnt matter


[23-Nov-18 04:45 AM] Alright#0419

[23-Nov-18 05:16 AM] CrisF#3405
Incentivized testing is only a feature of what KMDLabs offers. And the PoC for that proved it works very well.
Projects needing specific plans for incentivized tests can set them up with us. There is a risk of 'loosing' money, but testing software generally isn't free at that level anyhow.


[23-Nov-18 05:18 AM] CrisF#3405
Of course there is also the possibility of gain too.


[23-Nov-18 05:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
Its a lot about keeping devs making stuff together as well, colabaration, as they all share the same coin, rather than having a new token for evey contract, this allows things to happen much faster than usual, as have already been proven by what we have done already.


[23-Nov-18 05:27 AM] CrisF#3405
Also the people using the test cluster aren't and probably won't only be devs looking to profit. Of course there is that possibility. 
Many of the people now are there to learn through there testing.


[23-Nov-18 05:28 AM] CrisF#3405
As for the testers, not all and probably not most are there for a salary or even a big score.  I was there to learn, help and maybe as a very long shot get some valuable coins back.
Many people have projects, ideas, or in some cases just dreams, that they need a place to work on. KMDLabs gives them that place. The ease of use and network of support makes that very much easier than doing by themselves.


[23-Nov-18 06:14 AM] jl777c#5810

Yeah LABS has saves time.  Everything you do saves the newbie blockchain  üêí  operator from starting from zero.  Just like Ubuntu took Debian‚Äôs testing repo and accelerated the Debian release process.  Check history from Debian Sid to the following releases.

When a dApp team knows front end coding and some of the crypto conditions logic but not vin/vout details, they‚Äôre not going to know blockchain ops, mining pools, coin migrations etc.

Getting a product to market or productization of an idea needs agility and flexibility.  LABS gives this to the ecosystem.

Hello guys...
I'm trying to compare a PoS-based crypto currency with Pirate.

PoS is protected against 51 % attacks.  In addition, PoS could become more interesting in the future for environmentally friendly reasons.  Even Ethereum is working on a hybrid version.  I am asking myself how Komodo wants to solve this problem?  Hybrid with the help of Veruscoin?  Or is it something you don't even think about?


[01-Jan-19 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
PoS has some other issues than 51% attack, though dPoW likely solves most of them


[01-Jan-19 10:14 AM] Seko#7408
Where are the advantages of dPoW in compare to PoS? And what about the environmental idea?

you cant compare dPoW to PoS

dPoW works with whatever existing consensus mechanism

weakness of PoS is not external reference


[01-Jan-19 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
dPoW is all about external reference

you need to at least understand a bit about PoS weakness to understand

If consensus is a layer of concrete on the sidewalk/pavement, and your layer of concrete is as thick as your community invollved (PoW or PoS), there is still one layer of concrete.

One layer of concrete is pretty easy to drill into and make a hole for a person to squeeze into.

dPoW adds 2 more concrete layers (KMD & BTC), and an important timing layer.

Try drilling into 3 layers of concrete, of different grades.  You need different drill bits to go through different harder concrete.

The KMD & BTC layers also have steel mesh to re-inforce and strengthen it.
Your drill needs to be good enough to drill through 3 layers of concrete, be wide enough for the  person to climb into.

The drill holes are filled by very quickly drying cement, almost as soon as someone tries drilling into it - because the cement auto-repairs as time moves forwards (blocks are made).

But this seems business related, FDA is testing a permissioned blockchain for healthcare providers to share access to sensitive information. It started with 4 hospitals (not sure where it's at now) but they are using the consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton to develop a solution. Seems they are using Ethereum but adding privacy features (I believe off-chain)
<https://gcn.com/articles/2018/06/22/fda-blockchain-ehr-sharing.aspx>

Here's Booz Allen Hamilton's white paper in regards to the chain.
<https://blockchainhealthcaretoday.com/index.php/journal/article/view/13/17>

TLDR: Building permissioned blockchain that provides 3 tiers of information access, a descriptor(public), summary (permissioned), and full access (permissioned). They said "special purpose software designed to work along side the blockchain must be implemented to facilitate additional layers of encryption that enforce the privacy of content embedded within transaction data"
Also that "the data owner may revoke access to a piece of shared data with a guarantee that even a receiver‚Äôs private key together with the raw blockchain transaction data would not be sufficient to obtain data access"

@n2okpride and @Bitcoin Benny, thoughts on this for a business opportunity/use case for Komodo? Seems the privacy aspect could be something Komodo could do well.

email : Cyran_Marek2@bah.com

Lauren Neal - Principal Strategy Innovations Group - Booz Allen Hamilton (On that project)

We should reach out to these people just to make a connection, talk with them about the types of things they see their clients needing from blockchain and what is missing from projects like Ethereum. What they have to do to get around the limitations they are seeing on chain, and we can attempt to develop solutions, or might even already have the solutions (zk-snarks for privacy, language agnostic for contracts, etc) in order to make Komodo a more attractive platform. And then we can be on their minds when they look to implement another Blockchain for their clients.

I understand sapling addresses are pretty efficient and removing z-addressing might be the proper way to move forward swiftly. However, in my mind being backward compatible and knowing that my funds are safe in the ecosystem  for the years ahead are quite more important. There seems to be a tradeoff here. Isnt this a big decision to remove these addresses? Some people will lose their funds for sure. Or some people might think twice to leave their funds in KMD if they wont be able to check KMD news for a while. Was there any alternative solutions? What was their pro cons?


[23-Jan-19 04:36 AM] idrtis#7552
Im not sure whether this is the corret channel to ask

Completely inaccurate. No one will be losing KMD over this as long as they have their privkey safe. And, there are only about 80K funds left in sprout address. Users still have 3 weeks time to move them to transparent address.

Hiya! @polycryptoblog  everyone! üòÉ Introduced myself before in #üí¨‚îÉgeneral  I am involved with https://resistance(dot)io (  exchange, ResDEX and contacting you on their behalf. I have reached out to individual projects within KMD ecosystem before but thought it best to interact with you guys directly.

We wish to position ourselves as 'One Stop exchange' for all privacy coins. For liquidity provision we have partnered with HUOBI & XRP market-makers. As a DEX we do not plan to charge listing fee for KMD or its asset chains. 

Happy to give contact information so we can discuss about this more with a developer from team, perhaps jl777?  Looking forward to cooperating! 

------
Short tldr;  ResDEX uses instant atomic swaps (within 30 sec trades at the moment) for decentralized trading (using RES as collateral) and zk-Snarks for Privacy.
TOR routing is supported natively as well on ResDEX.  RES coin itself is CPU mineable through yespower algo (rewards split between 30% Proof of Research, 30% Proof of Work, 30% Masternodes & 10% for development)  and anyone can check out working prototype for POR through https://respool.io/

P.S Would partners@komodoplatform. com be the best way to reach out to you guys? : )

As an added question @polycryptoblog  we are also interested in listing multiple sub-chains (that obviously support atomic swap (probably rules out ARRR  :/ ) ). If possible; can you send me leads for them or suggest best possible way to reach out? 

I would assume that every project within KMD ecosystem would have its own requirements for listing and point of contact?

@Wolf of RES I notice your DEX, which is built on MM1, offers Instant Swaps. Is the collateral address independent or still under third party control (Komodo used wallets which they had control over for this mode)?


[12-Feb-19 02:26 PM] crypto999#4866
And if independent can you expand on how that was achieved, as there are a host of variables that make it problematic...


[13-Feb-19 02:58 AM] Wolf of RES#8148
@crypto999  Masternodes will be used to secure the collateral. Will outline roles for masternodes more in our governance document which we are drafting at the moment. 

To ask your opinion what problems do you foresee ?

@Cryptoon yes he knows of settlemint.   they are well known in belgium.  we'll see if we can get a contract with them.  they have some good ideas.  kmd is definitely a platform they can move to with what they want to do.

@Malti
Kasper from Guts was in a Dutch broadcast yesterday. He said that they had choosen for Ethereum because that was the only one with a smart contract at that time. Whether they experienced limits on Ethereum, the answer was yes and no.

He told that there are indeed better blockchains at the moment, but that they do not want to choose a blockchain too early. They do not want to focus on Komodo or another one yet. Komodo, because of the high transactions would possible be a good reason he said, but they first want to look at how they can use the blockchain. Which applications are needed and only then see which chain fits the best for them.

He said: Why choose Komodo, consider because of the high transaction could be a reason but do we need it or can we do it smarter.

He really needs to do some homework I think! üòÄ

@buyETH  maybe you should use dPoW üòÉ youd know what that is if you did any research on Komodo and our ‚Äústaking‚Äù as well

[18-Apr-19 04:14 PM] Oliver Westbrook#7752

@Oliver Westbrook can install it on https://komodo-cakeshop.com to test if that's what you're asking about?  i can setup a new subdomain or put it on another domain like https://cakeshop.dev or something

We are trying to make a node mediation service for KMD, Can I ask how can we talk about more details?


[02-May-19 12:14 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@buyETH   KMD does not have Masternodes , PoS or DPoS,  however chains created through Komodo can have this ( or similar function ),  if you could send an email to partners@komodoplatform.com , I can fill you in on what we offer and we can discuss best how to collaborate

Maybe should have asked this in marketing, but are there any efforts to try and poach projects to get them onto the platform?(in a general sense)

Yes


[06-May-19 08:58 PM] AALEXJ#5233
Are you guys aware of anyone building something similar on komodo as yet? Less of a ride sharing company and more of a peer to peer app

As for p2p apps,  utrum is working on his prediction stuff, RedFOX is working on some games , Marmara is working on a p2p credit system,   There is atomicdex as well which is all p2p swaps.


[06-May-19 09:14 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Don‚Äôt think anyone is doing p2p services like ridesharing in the ecosystem yet.  Services based around a crypto have their challenges


[12-Sep-19 08:26 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
If the multiple-signature wallet provider restricts its role to creating un-hosted
wallets that require adding a second authorization key to the wallet owner‚Äôs private
key in order to validate and complete transactions, the provider is not a money
transmitter because it does not accept and transmit value.56
56. 31 CFR ¬ß 1010.100(ff)(5)(ii)(A).
 On the other hand, if the
person combines the services of a multiple-signature wallet provider and a hosted
wallet provider, that person will then qualify as a money transmitter. Likewise,
if the value is represented as an entry in the accounts of the provider, the owner
does not interact with the payment system directly, or the provider maintains
total independent control of the value, the provider will also qualify as a money
transmitter, regardless of the label the person applies to itself or its activities.

it seems pegs CC msig is ok, according to the above as it is using the decentralized blockchain and it isnt a wallet service
