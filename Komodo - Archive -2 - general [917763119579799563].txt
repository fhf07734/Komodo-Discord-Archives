In the feed section on my AtomicDEX there is no code pinned


[13-Dec-21 10:33 AM] Sanchez#4639
This is required for the campaign


[13-Dec-21 01:16 PM] ejuliano#8606
does this campaign include non-geoblocked atomicdex like marmara community's, or is it only specifically for the geoblocked atomic dex.
( so i can properly inform people i'm referring)


[13-Dec-21 01:37 PM] Delton#2644
We'll look into this and provide a response. Currently, the newsfeed is showing up for me.


[13-Dec-21 01:38 PM] Delton#2644
Only geoblocked AtomicDEX Mobile


[13-Dec-21 02:16 PM] ejuliano#8606
oh it's a mobile campaign only?  ok got it


[13-Dec-21 06:41 PM] fuzzy247#8736
I tried to download the mobile app but it says "We're sorry, the requested URL was not found on this server." Is that because I'm geoblocked?


[13-Dec-21 07:26 PM] jspook16#3059
only mobile üò¶


[14-Dec-21 06:40 AM] Delton#2644
If you're in the mobile app and can see the news feed, there will be a 20-letter word as the first status. That is the code for the referral campaign.


[14-Dec-21 06:50 AM] ejuliano#8606
does everyone have the same code?


[14-Dec-21 06:58 AM] TonyL#3577
It should be in a first message (a long word starting from BRIDGE) - do you see some messages without this one or no messages at all?


[14-Dec-21 07:11 AM] Ty_loty#0607
Hey , can I send bnb to Atomic Dex via Binance smart chain ?


[14-Dec-21 07:11 AM] Ty_loty#0607
Or do I have to use Eth network ?


[14-Dec-21 07:18 AM] PTYX#6840
You can use BSC


[14-Dec-21 07:18 AM] PTYX#6840
Just make sure you activate the BEP20 coin on atomicdex to see the balance. The eth and bsc address should be the same.


[14-Dec-21 07:19 AM] Ty_loty#0607
Sweet thanks

[14-Dec-21 02:39 PM] Ginger Design#1182
Heyyoo!

First of all thank you guys all for this beautiful event! Been able to show several of my friends the practicality of AtomicDEX so far thanks to this campaign. Thank you üíê 

I've participated in the campaign and made 56 entries ü•≥  so far. However didn't receive any post entry confirmation mails although that option on the Gleam menu has been clicked.

Wrote to Gleam on their Contact Us section already yet they haven't replied yet.

Is there a way for me to know if my entries are still valid?
One more thing, as @Minigunner suggested the Top 10 list seems to be lagging or not working properly for me too.

Hi. How long does it take to implement new trading pair? Does it depends of blockchain?


[16-Dec-21 01:11 PM] PTYX#6840
Yes, it depends on the type of chain and how difficult the integration is


[16-Dec-21 01:14 PM] marracc#2379
Do you have some estimations, or approx. time?


[16-Dec-21 01:15 PM] marracc#2379
I mean, is it in years, months, days


[16-Dec-21 01:15 PM] PTYX#6840
2 weeks on easy integrations, 1 month on tough ones if the chain is UTXO based or has HTLC


[16-Dec-21 01:16 PM] marracc#2379
Thnx. Do you have any waiting list, or some order for listings?


[16-Dec-21 01:17 PM] PTYX#6840
Yes we have a pipeline


[16-Dec-21 01:18 PM] marracc#2379
Can you share stack order, or is it available somewhere?


[16-Dec-21 01:21 PM] marracc#2379

Do you have 51% attack resistance?


[16-Dec-21 01:23 PM] marracc#2379
Quantum resistance?

So, what is order? What will you add and when?


[17-Dec-21 09:55 AM] PTYX#6840
The development team works off sprints and they prioritize the work internally based on a few things. Paid integrations, potential volume, and ease of integration. As of now there is only one coin in the pipeline which is RSK, we're finishing the technical integration and the MOU. I haven't onboarded any new coins in the past 2 months because I was asked to hold off until next year. The entire team is working on improving the current dex, liquidity tools, and the release of the webdex. The latter 3 are taking up most of our bandwidth at the moment.


[17-Dec-21 09:56 AM] PTYX#6840
The development sprints aren't public but they aren't a secret either. If I don't respond immediately when you ask something it's because I got caught up doing something else.


[17-Dec-21 09:57 AM] PTYX#6840
The same goes for dPoW integrations. We aren't onboarding anything new until the development team frees up bandwidth.


[17-Dec-21 09:58 AM] PTYX#6840
In case you missed it, the team added over 10 different coins in the past few months along with support for Polygon, Avax, and HECO

Yes, sometimes transactions will still go through after short disconnections, but it's always better to stay online the entire duration of the swap if possible.

Are you asking about specific metrics? I think we‚Äôll have an end-of-campaign report for the final numbers, but I know a few things already accomplished include:

- More AtomicDEX daily downloads and active users
- Creation of a template for running more referral campaigns with other third-party projects
- More awareness around Komodo and AtomicDEX (i.e. increased page views on atomicdex.io and new social media followers)
- Establishment of an active community around the usability testing program where people can give feedback about future AtomicDEX releases (users who signed up for this referral campaign will be invited to participate in 2022).

1. sometimes you have to even try things 
2. we should take in mind the fact that some weeks agi the general crypto volume was much higher with the 70k+ btc craze üòâ


[26-Dec-21 01:05 PM] VandarGR#6065
In general, I think that such campaigns are nice especially when they are organized with Community driven classic PoW projects like digibyte ‚ù§Ô∏è üî•


[26-Dec-21 01:57 PM] jspook16#3059
I wasnt trying to be negative. I agree that things need to be attempted so that we can get metrics. I'm curious to see how effect this was to increase swap quantities


[26-Dec-21 01:58 PM] Artist#0765
If there is some legit liquidity I think atomicdex is a killer tech tbh


[26-Dec-21 01:58 PM] Artist#0765
the only problem is that we don't have the liquidity compared to other dex or similiar exchanges

Winners will be announced on this week's Thursday Townhall, won't be contacted via email.

I hope that having classic PoW community projects like digibyte, litecoin, bitcoinz, raptoreum etc as vehicle, atomixdex will build higher organic volumes in the near future.

It really deserves it. People have to realize what trading from your own wallet means.

LTC - KMD exchange, maker payment usually takes 12 min but it took more than 1 hour for me, why? because the other participant was not online?


[27-Dec-21 05:19 AM] cipi#4502
because you used the default settings for incoming KMD transaction which is set to wait for the tx to be notarized, that takes 20-60 minutes
if you want it to be faster, use other settings, like 5 normal confirmations


[27-Dec-21 05:20 AM] tyler2225#6959

[27-Dec-21 05:23 AM] tyler2225#6959
in custom settings, i can set 1-5 confirmations, it means 1: fast, 5: slow? but if it is going through fast, then do i have any disadvantage?


[27-Dec-21 05:27 AM] cipi#4502
yes, you loose security against 51% attacks... the notarizations are exactly for this, to make them impossible


[27-Dec-21 05:29 AM] tyler2225#6959
and attack means losing the amount to be sent?


[27-Dec-21 05:33 AM] cipi#4502
yes, owning 51% of the hashrate of a chain makes https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-spending possible...


[27-Dec-21 05:34 AM] tyler2225#6959
its better to keep the default confirmation count, if i dont want to lose my balance


[27-Dec-21 05:37 AM] cipi#4502
you need to decide for yourself... most small UTXO coins without extra protection are very cheap to attack: https://www.crypto51.app/
i decided for myself that 5 confirmations for KMD and no notarization are fine

[27-Dec-21 05:43 AM] cipi#4502
i keep the notarizations on for all assetchains, but not for KMD itself
a 51% attack with double spending intentions needs to be well planned and mounted... and the chances that someone will target AtomicDEX swaps directly with such an attack are small, chances are much higher it will be directed against CEXes, the failing AtomicDEX swaps are only collateral damage üôÇ

whats the best technique when i want to exchange/swap a coin (to any coin) but the listed orders are low (dex compared to cex)
- option 1: a little bit increase this low order price and make a new order (but i think people will buy it at the lowest price, so its not that good)
- option 2: find another coin that has no orders at all and set the price a little bit higher than the other coin (maybe its the best option because if they search for another coin and its value is similar to the other coin, then they will take it)
- option 3: any other idea?

the background of the question: i used option 1, but noone took the coin for 1-2 days, now i am trying option 2, hopefully it will work within a day, otherwise i have to think of another way to sell the coin


[27-Dec-21 08:25 AM] jspook16#3059
depending on the coin; If the coin is on a CEX with decent liquidity, you could set the price a little lower to entire the folks that scalp. You could also advertise your order in the trading channel as not all folks are always checking orders on adex (this is why we need a troll box chat within the atomicdex app itself). If the coin is not on a CEX ...then asking around in trading channel might be your best bet.


[27-Dec-21 08:27 AM] tyler2225#6959
is the name of that channel "talk-trading"? i thought people check the orders directly on atomicdex and make decisions of buying or not accordingly


[27-Dec-21 09:26 AM] jspook16#3059
typically they do check atomicdex directly. But I think after a while people stop checking unless they are trying to trade. But if I see someone posting about an order on adex that might be good i might go check it out.

What happened to BTX coin on AtomicDEX (Windows-client)? i have 10 BTX balance on wallet but it shows 0 for swapping, however other coins are tradable (e.g. KMD, DGB), BTX also worked 2 days ago, now that it does not show the balance for trade, it is not swapable, however on wallet i see the real balance, there are 5 orders and i should be able to choose any of these

as a workaround when i manually write the balance, it shows order but then it reverts back to 0 balance using simple DEX

in Pro DEX when i create a new order, then i get this message:
[{"error":"rpc:174] dispatcher_legacy:155] lp_ordermatch:3037] taker_swap:1532] result:1897] Transport error: JsonRpcError { client_info: \"coin: BTX\", request: JsonRpcRequest { jsonrpc: \"2.0\", id: \"1227\", method: \"blockchain.estimatefee\", params: [Number(1)] }, error: Response(btx-electrumx.coinsmunity.com:50002, Object({\"code\": Number(-102), \"message\": String(\"server busy - request timed out\")})) }"}]


[30-Dec-21 01:15 AM] TonyL#3577
According to the error their electrum server which using in atomicdex-desktop (btx-electrumx.coinsmunity.com:50002) is down


[30-Dec-21 02:15 AM] tyler2225#6959
is it temporary?


[30-Dec-21 02:24 AM] TonyL#3577
Until the party which hosting this server (BTX devs or community - I'm not sure) fix it. There is no contact detail in https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins/blob/master/electrums/BTX, maybe @cipi knows better


[30-Dec-21 03:03 AM] tyler2225#6959
so there are two possibilities
- either the url is temporarily unavailable because of maintence or other issues, or
- they changed their url and AtomicDEX has to update the config file with the new url


[30-Dec-21 03:38 AM] cipi#4502
really strange, the electrum server works, just `blockchain.estimatefee` calls are timing out
forwarded the question, waiting for answer
we can also switch to fixed fee for BTX, then there is no need for `estimatefee` call


[30-Dec-21 03:52 AM] tyler2225#6959
@cipi i have similar (but not the same) issue for LTFN and LYNX, for these coins the balance is shown 0 for some cases, can you also check those coins?


[30-Dec-21 04:03 AM] cipi#4502
LYNX and LTFN electrums are working fine
the reason for your 0 balance must be something else...
what does explorer say?
have you mined to the ADEX address?


[30-Dec-21 04:21 AM] tyler2225#6959
The issue is the following with LTFN
- on wallet panel i see 4000 LTFN, but wallet balance is 0 currency (cannot convert)
- on simple DEX when i click on MAX, it shows 0 (tradable is also 0)

The issue is the following with LYNX
- on wallet panel i see 6000 LTFN, and wallet balance is also shown in USD or other currency (converted)
- on simple DEX when i click on MAX, it shows 0  (tradable is also 0)

All of the other coins, e.g. KMD
- on wallet panel i see x KMD, and wallet balance is also shown in USD or other currency (converted)
- on simple DEX when i click on MAX, it shows the same value as balance


[30-Dec-21 04:23 AM] tyler2225#6959
--> it means: sometimes it takes 1 second, sometimes it takes 5 second to load tradable on simple DEX view, and for other coins eg. for LTFN it never loads
I am using a relatively recent daily built version: 0.5.3-beta


[30-Dec-21 04:29 AM] cipi#4502
simple trading view has a filter, so only coins with 24h trading volume > 10k USD are shown
but not that familiar with simple trading view, i only use the pro view
sorry, i have to go, i have an appointment, will be back in couple hours

[05-Jan-22 12:17 AM] tyler2225#6959
is there an easy-to-use API for AtomicDex or website that shows the most profitable exchange pair? Coin1 --> Coin2 --> Coin1 (back and forth to gain profit), i checked dexstats.info/arbitrage.php but i dont understand how it works, it says Coin1 --> Coin2 but on AtomicDex it shows -10% CEX


[05-Jan-22 12:41 AM] cipi#4502
https://dexstats.info/arbitrage.php does not have anything to do with CEX price or CEX arbitrage, the arbitrage shown there is in the orderbook itself, directly on ADEX, buy from one dude, sell to the other dude... have a look in the respective orderbooks, then you see what i mean


[05-Jan-22 12:43 AM] cipi#4502
"negative spread"... i guess you get that only on AtomicDEX


[05-Jan-22 12:46 AM] cipi#4502
for good offers i use "best orders" from ADEX Desktop itself
this is output for buying 11 KMD atm

[05-Jan-22 03:00 AM] tyler2225#6959
yes "best orders" is good, i use it too, but you have to click each coin one by one to see best orders for each coin, 
on arbitrage.php it is not consistent with AtomicDEX, one example at the moment:
KMD    DGB    21.80360000    21.72100000    1,524.48000000    KMD/DGB Orderbook    0.38%
on  "best orders" it shows KMD --> DGB +1.94% (with red color), it means if I sell KMD for DGB then i will lose 1.94% of my fiat converted value (e.g. balance in USD), thats why i dont understand how arbitrage.php would offer profitable exchanges


[05-Jan-22 03:09 AM] tyler2225#6959
maybe it goes about the amount, if you have 11 KMD then you can get -0.26% (profit) DGB, if i have 0.002 KDM, then i can get +1.94% (loss) DGB ... so arbitrage relates to the amount, and not appliable for all amount, but usually for high amounts
it means for small amounts, it is better to check "best orders" directly on AtomicDEX ... and for big amounts, you can also check arbitrage.php


[05-Jan-22 04:18 AM] viparmenia#0950
Seems Bilaxy do not want to restore KMD trading. Here is the response to my ticket:
"Bilaxy Support (BILAXY Support)
Jan 4, 2022, 21:17 GMT+8
the trading of a certain token has not resumed, then there is a high probability that the trading of a certain token will not resume due to the lack of liquidity in the secondary market and other reasons."


[05-Jan-22 06:34 AM] cipi#4502
as i said, arbitrage.php only shows ADEX, the arbitrage is in the ADEX orderbook itself... buy LTC from a dude for 199 KMD and sell to the other (also on ADEX, also same orderbook) for 200... look in the orderbook!

I agree with this


[13-Jan-22 09:34 AM] PTYX#6840
I think a pure DEX build that is just a bridge will be used heavily

I made another design and I took pains to continue with each step and the winner did not follow any of them, he did not have any of the two required words

Did two swaps over the past 24 hours. First one took 57 mins. The second one was only 18 mins! That is a huge improvement.


[14-Jan-22 07:48 AM] EPIDEMIC.media#4332
What is the fastest swap on record?


[14-Jan-22 07:55 AM] lpdz011#9233
Some swaps only need some seconds


[14-Jan-22 07:56 AM] lpdz011#9233
For example Smartchainswaps without dpow and 1 confirmations

Ah ok. They were both Matic to KMD. Fees are super cheap. I'm genuinely thrilled with what I am seeing.

My personal best is 58 seconds, dont have this trade in the history but here is one minute 2 sec. swap. https://anonfiles.com/Teg4qaBfx0/Screenshot_from_2022-01-14_18-03-57_png

3 reasons why Harmony (ONE) rallied back to its all-time high this ...
Strong fundamentals, an influx of new users and a recently launched $300 million developer incentive are just a few reasons why ONE price is chasing a new all-time high.

[17-Jan-22 05:18 PM] smkhound#7640
if running native, it is shown in stdout on launch


[17-Jan-22 05:19 PM] smkhound#7640
depending on what you need it for, might need to endian flip it
