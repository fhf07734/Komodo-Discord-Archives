don't worry @33K blueprints ready - we have a lot of content in a lot of places and creating a "Komodoshi's Learning Centre" is one of the goals to complete.  What industries/demographics/skill-level etc. do you have or what exactly are you looking for in an education?  High level potential use cases?

Hi


[20-Aug-18 01:03 PM] if(!destiny){return slave}#0736
anyone learning C?


[20-Aug-18 01:09 PM] DG#6934
I am trying to lear C++


[20-Aug-18 01:09 PM] DG#6934
using some cool youtube tutorials


[20-Aug-18 04:13 PM] Jonathan#3687
C++ is fun, C# is a little easier - don't have to worry about memory management


[20-Aug-18 05:45 PM] if(!destiny){return slave}#0736
this old timer coder i met tells me C is the language to rule them all and once your learn C  and its ins and out, you will be a top coder, he stands by use of memory management and pointers


[20-Aug-18 05:46 PM] Jonathan#3687
each data structure has it's uses, vectors were my favorite but not so good for memory


[20-Aug-18 05:58 PM] if(!destiny){return slave}#0736
what would be the benefit for using C , over C# , or even C++ ?


[20-Aug-18 06:01 PM] Jonathan#3687
Have to defer to others on that one, never used C


[20-Aug-18 06:26 PM] if(!destiny){return slave}#0736
@Jonathan what languages do you program in ?


[20-Aug-18 06:33 PM] Jonathan#3687
I know C++, some C#, Javascript, SQL, PL-SQL mainly. Skimmed over others

most all the other languages derive from C, or have their compilers written in C


[21-Aug-18 12:39 AM] jl777c#5810
to write system software, you need the control C gives you


[21-Aug-18 12:41 AM] jl777c#5810
C++ masks using  pointers, but it is using them, you are just shielded from it and prevented from directly debugging


[21-Aug-18 12:42 AM] jl777c#5810
also C++ makes you rely on all these standard classes and will take 10x longer to get to where you can do things properly

James lee, is a 777 (god) at c?  😂


[21-Aug-18 07:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
And if you really want to understand what a C compiler does, learn assembly


[21-Aug-18 07:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
I wrote this intro to coding in assembly with NASM just about 18 years ago, when I was supposed to be learning C in my college classes: http://leto.net/writing/nasm.php


[21-Aug-18 07:04 AM] dukeleto#7326
and yes, some of my classmates were dinosaurs and cavemen. It was a long time ago.


[21-Aug-18 07:08 AM] jl777c#5810
the best way is to write a C compiler!


[21-Aug-18 07:08 AM] jl777c#5810
in C


[21-Aug-18 08:42 AM] DG#6934
Understood ok I will try seeing C shortly also , maybe I can get to know why somethings in C++ work in certain way


[21-Aug-18 08:43 AM] DG#6934
The thing about this videos is that I can memorize and pretty much do the same code that they put me from scratch


[21-Aug-18 08:44 AM] DG#6934
but to see a constant use doing your own programs and practicing yourself with things that entertain you  day to day is what makes it even more fun. and actually easy to learn. If you loose practice because you don't see an end to learning you can get rusty...I think most people go C++ for video games


[21-Aug-18 08:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c where to start from? any book recommendation ?


[21-Aug-18 08:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
for C


[21-Aug-18 08:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I chose C++ as part of the CC smart contract has to go to komodod, which is C++ mainly.


[21-Aug-18 08:47 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but I'd still majorly focus on Go language.


[21-Aug-18 08:48 AM] jl777c#5810
The CC contracts code I am writing is 90% C

what is the best  language to learn for blockchain dev


[21-Aug-18 09:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
modren devs are leaning towards golang and rust


[21-Aug-18 09:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but code so far has been dominated by C/C++ I think for existing projects


[21-Aug-18 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
C


[21-Aug-18 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
I seem to have done ok with C


[21-Aug-18 09:04 AM] if(!destiny){return slave}#0736
@jl777c  how long have you been coding in C


[21-Aug-18 09:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
:trollface: a trick question.....


[21-Aug-18 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems like a few hundred years

[21-Aug-18 09:05 AM] if(!destiny){return slave}#0736
how old are you ?

😄


[21-Aug-18 09:06 AM] if(!destiny){return slave}#0736
so there is go , rust, c , and c++


[21-Aug-18 09:06 AM] if(!destiny){return slave}#0736
two super old lower level, and two new high level


[21-Aug-18 09:07 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, so I'll instead chose to focus on C and Golang instead of C++ an Golang now.


[21-Aug-18 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810
the only thing hard about C is pointers


[21-Aug-18 09:08 AM] if(!destiny){return slave}#0736
i hear C is easier then c++


[21-Aug-18 09:08 AM] jl777c#5810
once you understand points (you will already need to understand memory) and then you can cut through all the abstractions that try to hide these details

I got away from C/C++ mainly because of practices/exercises given to us in study was mostly maths exercises.

and I'm not good with maths. jus a OK level.


[21-Aug-18 09:12 AM] if(!destiny){return slave}#0736
i pretty decent with math


[21-Aug-18 09:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
now that I know what I need to do, and the problems I have in hand to solve, I don't care what I will go through to learn and complete them.


[21-Aug-18 09:13 AM] if(!destiny){return slave}#0736
so c./c++ , golang, or rust


[21-Aug-18 09:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
will get hands dirty and mind bend by maths too if required.


[21-Aug-18 09:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
my choice is C and golang.


[21-Aug-18 09:14 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

@jl777c what language would you suggest learning if i want to get the most for the time it takes to learn... given my advanced age i think my focus should shift into learning something more efficient .  i know you like C, but i was wondering if you have other suggestions looking into the future of crypto and applications and could suggest something that will be big in the future of Cs and especifically blockchain.


[06-Sep-18 05:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
Python is the easiest, I started n BASH shell script, which seems to share a lot of syntax with C, so moving to reading C code at least has not been so hard. I think its more understading how it works, like with anything else. If you understand the how, and what, then implementation in any language is pretty simple.


[07-Sep-18 01:20 AM] jl777c#5810
Most all the languages descended from C. C has very little extras, so i think can be learned the quickest. dont be afraid of pointers.


[09-Sep-18 05:31 AM] Mylo#8306
@Deleted User learning how to program is one thing, doing something useful is another unfortunately.   learning C is a good primer for the reasons james mentions.   the main thing to do is do it often for a a few weeks.  if you are new, setting up your dev environment will the the first lesson.  if you start on linux it's easier.  once you understand things like main() function is a entry point for the program, other lanugages have their equivalent entry point.   how languages treat numbers, text, threads so you can manage them then becomes about learning syntax once you have fundamentals learned and can pick up a new language much easier than your first.

Hey guys. I am new to this Komodo channel.
I am a frontend developer working on React/Redux stack. Also few months back I started learning about Blockchain and smart contracts, tokens etc and now I feel confident enough to participate in some blockchain development going on.
So please let me know how to get my hands on Komodo platform and how can I help the Komodo community in any way, if I can.

In react for a web service I've used superagent, axios etc. So I am very much comfortable. I have worked on websockets as well

[13-Sep-18 01:35 AM] Mylo#8306
@iamsaksham ok good to know.  we also have different dev teams working on different things, so there really is no wrong answer at the moment - although i'm hoping to get front end coders like yourself up and running in 5 minutes with docker.   you'll be able to build a very elaborate gui in pretty quick time.  The (beta) 5 minute quickstart may be available next week with some light docs - so unfortunately, my own way of getting you going quickly is:


1.  `docker pull imylomylo/jl777-komodo/dev` will get an image from https://hub.docker.com/r/imylomylo/jl777-komodo-dev/ (github link there for Dockerfile)

Works best on ubuntu.

There is no CORS support on the daemon atm, so you need to proxy the RPC requests.   There are nodejs modules to help with this, but i haven't explored them because I'm working on a nodejs rpc lib https://github.com/imylomylo/komodo-rpc-lib/tree/master/src


Otherwise, use a virtual machine with ubuntu - you can then use docker in there or work on building komodo from source http://i.mylomylo.com/build-komodo-source

lmk any questions - this channel and #💻┃dev-general channel and any questions should be answered in pretty quick time.

building from src is the best if you're comfortable with compiling code, pretty straight forward.  we all build komodo daily multiple times so maybe 
Oh and....if you dont' want to wait for the chain to sync (3.5GB), use `-regtest` to interact with command line quickly to test out curl commands etc.

@Cas it's basically the same, you just use a different base58 prefix for KMD addresses, which becomes `R` in the final address

Evening..  Is there any way to get a daily estimate of how much Verus you could mine, by only having the mh/s?  Its not available on a site, like whattomine. I'd rather know how to do it on my own, if that's possible.

[10-Oct-18 01:54 AM] Mylo#8306
ask in #⛏┃talk-mining it's <your-hashrate>/<network-hashrate>*1440 blocks per day * 24 block reward * 0.5 because it is half mined half staked block reward = approx what you should earn.   but best to ask in mining or in VRSC discord mining channel.

so like the rewards plan it would allow to be parameterized
first step is to define all the parameters
then to implement it as faucet2

that is why it needs to be faucet2 a different CC

no, i mean like rewards, you can define and find arbitrary number of plans with different parameters

nothing to do with restarting the blockchain

faucet2create <param0> <param1> <param2> <param3>


[12-Oct-18 09:00 AM] jl777c#5810
then any usage of faucet2... <createtxid> would use those parameters


[12-Oct-18 09:00 AM] jl777c#5810
right now there is one faucet, globally


[12-Oct-18 09:01 AM] jl777c#5810
so there is no faucetcreate txid, it is implictly the only faucet


[12-Oct-18 09:01 AM] jl777c#5810
but different faucets would want different amounts, different ways of spam prevention different tx PoW, just off the top of my head

i am not saying make a faucet that is a rewards system

uthash.h
it has hashing and even simple queue stuff
i use DL_APPEND to add to a queue and then you can iterate through the queue
read all the uthash docs, it will make you a much more efficient coder
http://www.cs.bu.edu/~jappavoo/Resources/psml/apps/hashy/uthash/doc/userguide.html
https://troydhanson.github.io/uthash/utlist.html
utlist is the queue, start with that
you can grep my code for the actual usages
i cant remember how many places i used it
basically when a new item comes in, malloc a structure, set the fields, DL_APPEND
now its in the list
where you need to query the list, just do that and if it returns something at the head of the list, you get a FIFO
if you get something from the tail of the list it is LIFO
really you MUST understand fully about how to use lists and hashtables. with utlist/uthash you dont have to learn to write the internals (though that in itself is very good learning when time is available)
80% of computing is searching and sorting, something like that

All of our docs are here currently: http://docs.komodoplatform.com/
Eventhough they are all very usable and informative right now, they are aimed more at people who already know what they are doing.

More beginner friendly versions are on the way and the docs site will have an overhaul by January-2019
Till then please use the above docs and ask us here to fill any gaps in them.

Whichever node mines the first block gets the supply in its wallet if you don't start the daemon with a pubkey.

hey guys, i'm confused about the `ac_pubkey`  option when creating an asset chain? Where do you actually get a public key when the chain hasn't been started?


[01-Nov-18 10:35 AM] jorian#4555
any of the other chains


[01-Nov-18 10:35 AM] jorian#4555
```./komodo-cli getnewaddress
./komodo-cli validateaddress <address here>``` will show a pubkey for that new address


[01-Nov-18 10:36 AM] jorian#4555
and since you can do `./komodo-cli dumpprivkey` you can import it in the new chain


[01-Nov-18 10:37 AM] beybietron#2493
well since komod hasn't been started yet (I'm creating an asset chain), komodo-cli doesn't work


[01-Nov-18 10:37 AM] beybietron#2493
I guess I should just started komod first and sync with komodo blockchain first?


[01-Nov-18 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
why?


[01-Nov-18 10:38 AM] jorian#4555
you don't have to sync it completely


[01-Nov-18 10:39 AM] beybietron#2493
I presume I can't just generate any 33 byte hex string as the pubkey, it has to be generated by komodo-cli?


[01-Nov-18 10:40 AM] jorian#4555
there are plenty of generators around


[01-Nov-18 10:40 AM] jorian#4555
same math


[01-Nov-18 10:40 AM] jl777c#5810
any valid keypair is a valid keypair


[01-Nov-18 10:42 AM] beybietron#2493
Ah I see, I thought there are restrictions, like the first character of the address should be a specific character like other coins

Ah I see, I thought there are restrictions, like the first character of the address should be a specific character like other coins


[01-Nov-18 10:44 AM] jorian#4555
a pubkey doesn't have that yet


[01-Nov-18 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
address is the one with prefix


[01-Nov-18 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
base58.(prefix + rmd160(sha256(pubkey)))


[01-Nov-18 10:46 AM] beybietron#2493
I see, thanks for the explanation


[01-Nov-18 02:24 PM] beybietron#2493
one more thing, if I cannot new nodes to the assetchain, do they always have to have the same -ac parameters as the original 2 seed nodes?


[01-Nov-18 06:26 PM] gcharang#6833
Once the chain is greater than approx 120 blocks, you can add other nodes to the network using the same parameters as the first two nodes. the `-seednode` can be any of the first two nodes, it just needs to continously be online


[02-Nov-18 04:03 AM] jl777c#5810
different ac parameters refer to a different chain


[02-Nov-18 06:31 AM] beybietron#2493
thanks. what's the easiest way I can make an explorer for my test chain? I see there is something in the guides but it seems to be an explorer for all existing assetchains.

then edit the install-explorers.sh


[02-Nov-18 06:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
so the array of asserchains contains your test chains name


[02-Nov-18 06:40 AM] beybietron#2493
does it only need the names of the test chains?


[02-Nov-18 06:40 AM] beybietron#2493
looks like I can just add it in `kmd_coins.sh` but I don't know I've never used this

yes thats how you do it

remove all the ones you dont want


[02-Nov-18 06:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
the way I did it was just start the chain manually on command line


[02-Nov-18 06:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
then run install-exploers.sh

hey, ideas on how to use OP_RETURN  to build a tx in komodo cli?


[02-Nov-18 09:17 AM] jl777c#5810
createrawtransaction should allow you to specify "data" for opreturn, but you need to search for details


[02-Nov-18 09:20 AM] sergipcm#2275
like this one https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/komodo-API.html#createrawtransaction-txid-id-vout-n-address-amount


[02-Nov-18 09:21 AM] jl777c#5810
search for createrawtransaction opreturn


[02-Nov-18 09:22 AM] jl777c#5810
adding something like "data":"hexstring" adds an opreturn, i forget the details


[02-Nov-18 09:22 AM] jl777c#5810
use google

@Alright in theory, private key = `0` is not valid, smallest valid private key is `1`, since private key must be positive number I believe

Hi everyone!
I'm trying to understand UTXO based contracts and its relation to crypto-conditions.
I can see how contracts are added to komodo and how their API can be called via RPC. What I don't understand is what's happening under the hood. How are the contracts related to the IETF draft on crypto conditions (https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-thomas-crypto-conditions-04) and the libraries implementing it (e.g. https://github.com/libscott/libcryptoconditions)? I guess it's somehow via `OP_CHECKCRYPTOCONDITION` but don't understand how... I'd be very thankful if someone could point me to a good explanation or shed some light into the dark.


[23-Nov-18 02:35 AM] jl777c#5810
CC includes that as a subset, but it adds a lot of other things on top. the vout script is the serialized cryptoconditions hash


[23-Nov-18 07:14 AM] lorrrris#8439
Ok I think I now understand a bit more.
The key thing used of crypto-conditions is that using its condition/fullfillment scheme, anyone providing a correct fulfillment (opposed to a normal signature, like in standard payments)  can spend this output, right? This fulfillment is then already included in the transactions generated by e.g. `faucetGet()`. And for validation, whether to include a Tx in the blockchain, only the per contract specified validation functions are relevant.


[23-Nov-18 07:22 AM] jl777c#5810
all of the bitcoin rules, cryptocondition rules and the CC custom rules need to be passed


[23-Nov-18 07:22 AM] jl777c#5810
the cryptoconditions signature needs to be a valid fulfillment, but it is based on bitcoin utxo that are valid


[23-Nov-18 07:23 AM] jl777c#5810
and the final step is for the specific CC to return true, ie. that it is valid according to its rules. since arbitrary code can be in a CC, an arbitrary set of rules can be implemented


[24-Nov-18 06:58 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
I think @dukeleto  should run a crypto camp for students ...qualified students - 2k per student max 30 students for 2-3 weeks. - tents, food and camping gear not included.. just another krazy idea

Is there any examples of utilizing the rpc calls from a website? Does the end user need to have agama open and the chain running on native mode for the rpc calls to run?


[17-Dec-18 12:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Smedley that is a security issue, which is why many things are designed to prevent a website from talking to your local wallet. Otherwise, random websites could steal your money. This kind of bug has happened before


[17-Dec-18 12:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
older versions of Electrum had a bug that let evil websites talk to your local wallet and potentially steal funds, and definitely lose privacy/etc

[17-Dec-18 03:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
I've been thinking of something just like that for #kmdlabs. There are plentybof RPC calls that don't have anything to do with funds, and a node with its wallet disabled should be fine for that type of thing, but it depends what u want to do.


[17-Dec-18 04:50 PM] Smedley#8094
Would assets contract potentially work?


[17-Dec-18 05:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
You would need to be able to create al the transactions locally on your website


[17-Dec-18 05:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
When I mean it cannot use a wallet .... I kind of mean that the deamon litteralyl has no wallet compiled in.


[17-Dec-18 06:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
The are probably other ways to do it ... but apart from creating all the transacions with some java script library locally and using SPV or something to send th eraw hex to the blockchain ... I'm not sure it can be done . The other way is something like @smkhound 's DragonHound... Its due for a pre release soon so show what he has been able to accomplish. This projec uses 1 central server, and "logins" for multiple "users" to post GPS locations to the blockchain. Started out to track his exacaping dog but realy has evolved into something quite awesome, that ca be used to stro any sensor data on the blockchain.

There is no any params needed for getinfo call. I guess there is a auth issue when you've tried to create rpc_connection to your assetchain daemon

I am ruuning komodo on a windows machine


[18-Dec-18 06:47 PM] TonyL#3577
It should be a network/routing issue, since you cant establish RPC call via curl you cant do it with the same credentials in your python program as well


[18-Dec-18 06:52 PM] SuSC135#6248
What do you suggest I should do to debug this?


[18-Dec-18 06:52 PM] SuSC135#6248
Should I just run the komodo in a virtual env and try to access it form there?


[18-Dec-18 06:54 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm, just to understand picture better: is machine/os with komodo daemon and machine/os from which you're trying to do RPC calls are the same one?


[18-Dec-18 06:55 PM] SuSC135#6248
yes I am running daemon and trying to access it from the same machine . Its windows 10


[18-Dec-18 06:56 PM] smkhound#7640
Anything in debug.log?


[18-Dec-18 06:57 PM] smkhound#7640
Maybe win is disalowing run? Whats the win equivalent of chmod?


[18-Dec-18 06:59 PM] TonyL#3577
Btw maybe curl request example above isn't valid for Windows. Never tried to curl/RPC connect to komodod on Windows tbh


[18-Dec-18 07:00 PM] SuSC135#6248
Well yeah I can make komodo global environment variable


[18-Dec-18 07:00 PM] SuSC135#6248
I used a Mingw64 a wrapper for windows to do a curl call


[18-Dec-18 07:00 PM] SuSC135#6248
Like GitBash


[18-Dec-18 07:16 PM] TonyL#3577
@SuSC135 Are you trying to call `getinfo` on KMD chain or assetchain?


[18-Dec-18 07:17 PM] TonyL#3577
Just noticed that you get 401 Unauthorized for one of your RPC call methods


[18-Dec-18 07:18 PM] SuSC135#6248
I am trying it on my assets chain


[18-Dec-18 07:18 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh, thats where is the clue


[18-Dec-18 07:18 PM] SuSC135#6248
Should i include the name of my asset chain or txid somewhere?


[18-Dec-18 07:19 PM] TonyL#3577
username/password for assetchain connection store in /.komodo/%assetchainname%/%assetchainname%.conf


[18-Dec-18 07:20 PM] TonyL#3577
So there should be the folder with your assetchain name in same folder with `komodo.conf`


[18-Dec-18 07:20 PM] TonyL#3577
And inside this folder `assetchainname.conf` which defines connection params to your assetchain daemon


[18-Dec-18 07:21 PM] TonyL#3577
So you need to allow rpc connections in this assetchain config, restart assetchain daemon and try again your RPC calls with username/password same as in `assetchainname.conf`


[18-Dec-18 07:22 PM] SuSC135#6248

if you create your own chain you can specify how many coins you want

@SuSC135 the CL flag `-gen=1` turns on CPU solo mining and `-genproclimit=N` will use N cores/threads

@GlorymanRTS it depends on the coding you want to do, but in general, the more math you know, the more kinds of things you will be able to code


[20-Dec-18 02:16 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512

the addresses that you see for BTC, KMD and all other BTC forks, they are almost all in base58check format

some new kinds of addresses are different, but don't worry about that for now


[20-Dec-18 02:40 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
Is base 58 just as it sounds


[20-Dec-18 02:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
base58 is one thing, and then base58check is that plus a checksum


[20-Dec-18 02:40 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
It's a count upto 58 and then that's recorded as another digit to the left of the single digit.


[20-Dec-18 02:41 PM] GlorymanRTS#0512
Oh, want a checksum?

for testing a smart contract . should I create a new asset chain on my system and then try to query it with my existing asset chain? Or should I create a new asset chain in a different system and try to communicate with it? How should I proceed?


[20-Dec-18 04:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
@SuSC135 either option, also regtest mode is an option


[20-Dec-18 04:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
there must be some nodes running, maybe at least 2 sometimes, which know about your CC contract


[20-Dec-18 04:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
spin up locally and talk to it via localhost is probably what you want


[20-Dec-18 04:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
regtest mode makes it so mining blocks is very easy, it's for testing locally


[20-Dec-18 04:58 PM] SuSC135#6248
By testing I mean i want to create an application like a payment gateway using channel contract


[20-Dec-18 11:38 PM] smkhound#7640
you can also test on KMD labs if the current assetchains have the params you need


[21-Dec-18 11:55 AM] SuSC135#6248
I have created a channel contract. And when I am trying to do a channel open I get an error. The error doesn't give lot of information . Where am I going wrong

[21-Dec-18 01:40 PM] TonyL#3577
@SuSC135 Could you restart `-ac_name=ChannelTest` daemon with `--daemon` param to see the daemon output and try again?


[21-Dec-18 01:45 PM] TonyL#3577
Regards your previous question about best CC testing environment:
I think it's a best idea to spin own chain to not depends on someones updates and not guess if other nodes have same software versions when testing. It's super easy to spinoff chain so I don't see any reasons to not do it in private tests.


[21-Dec-18 01:47 PM] SuSC135#6248
yes I did spin up two different asset chains in my own system. with different port numbers and I am trying to open a channel between them.


[21-Dec-18 01:47 PM] SuSC135#6248
now I am getting this error


[21-Dec-18 01:47 PM] SuSC135#6248
``error code: -1
error message:
to use CC contracts, you need to launch daemon with valid -pubkey= for an address in your wallet``


[21-Dec-18 01:48 PM] SuSC135#6248
Here I have given pubkey of first assest chain


[21-Dec-18 01:49 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha, so actually this error means what it types: 
1) you have to get a pubkey on your assetchain for each node. Like a 
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ChannelTest getaccountaddress ""
./komodo-cli -ac_name=ChannelTest validateaddress address^^```


[21-Dec-18 01:50 PM] TonyL#3577
2) stop daemon and restart with -pubkey= param with pubkey which you get from actions above (other words pubkey valid for this wallet)


[21-Dec-18 01:50 PM] TonyL#3577
```./komodod -ac_name=ChannelTest otherparams... -pubkey=pubkeyfromvalidateaddressoutput ...  ```


[21-Dec-18 01:54 PM] SuSC135#6248
So let me get this right.. I have two asset chains KMDICE and ChannelTest.  And  I gave the pubkey of KMDice as a destination address in channelsopen of  ChannelTest asset chain


[21-Dec-18 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
what?


[21-Dec-18 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
channels is not cross chain


[21-Dec-18 01:56 PM] TonyL#3577
You have to open channel between pubkeys on the same chain


[21-Dec-18 01:57 PM] SuSC135#6248
Oh!! ok . So  I should have the address present in the same wallet of  a single chain. I get it now. Thank You


[21-Dec-18 01:59 PM] TonyL#3577
Destination pubkey may be related to any other wallet but on the same chain. And to be able to interact with CC by assetchain daemon you have to start it with valid -pubkey= for an address in your wallet

[21-Dec-18 02:04 PM] SuSC135#6248
Yes I am creating a project on python. I will look into this. Maybe I can get better sense of the channels


[21-Dec-18 02:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh in GUI not much channels RPC calls so far so will not help the logic.
https://github.com/gcharang/cryptoconditions_tui/blob/master/channels_cc_cli.py here an old channels TUI which implemented all the calls (but JSON outputs of channels changed since this time)

https://github.com/gcharang/cryptoconditions_tui in this fork left non RPC - direct komodo-cli calls via check_output

@SuSC135 just backed to my channels code - quite important moment `channelsinfo` call logic changed: 
now channelid as param is mandatory (before was possible to call it without an arguments) and new `channelslist` call was added. Also JSONs have a new look. So code above should not work 
I've reflected these changes in RPC calls desc file: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1l0dWEPcrv9zE11_TD-XrX_HIYV0VLpadCJN6hvaZERc/edit#gid=55258823 (channels page)

Could you please try to do this actions sequence again @SuSC135  ?


[22-Dec-18 11:56 AM] TonyL#3577
If you have 2 daemons and run one of them with correct pubkey - maybe you're issuing CC RPC calls on the second one which started without correct -pubkey param. Just an assumption


[22-Dec-18 11:58 AM] SuSC135#6248
So just for my understanding two deamons is one with komdod.exe or./komodod and another one is the RPC issusing daemon komod-cli.exe or ./komodo-cli

[22-Dec-18 12:03 PM] TonyL#3577
In `channelsopen` you have to specify a destination pubkey. 
First side (sender) is your wallet with "026079f1eb76b1dc9b5746cd486e2b43e4b981ad52093e9f79cbf7bc80ee952530" pubkey and second side (payments recipient) will be a wallet which belongs to pubkey which you specify in `channelsopen`


[22-Dec-18 12:07 PM] SuSC135#6248
no i started the daemon with another pubkey

[22-Dec-18 12:08 PM] TonyL#3577
Thats why you are getting this error: ```error code: -1
error message:
to use CC contracts, you need to launch daemon with valid -pubkey= for an address in your wallet
```


[22-Dec-18 12:08 PM] TonyL#3577
Because to use CC contracts, you need to launch daemon with valid -pubkey= for an address in your wallet


[22-Dec-18 12:08 PM] TonyL#3577
And valid pubkey for your wallet is `026079f1eb76b1dc9b5746cd486e2b43e4b981ad52093e9f79cbf7bc80ee952530`


[22-Dec-18 12:18 PM] SuSC135#6248
Is there any command to check the number of pubkey associated with my asset chain


[22-Dec-18 12:19 PM] SuSC135#6248
now I started the my daemon with this 026079f1eb76b1dc9b5746cd486e2b43e4b981ad52093e9f79cbf7bc80ee952530 address

[22-Dec-18 12:20 PM] TonyL#3577
In general you can get a list of addresses:
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=TONY7 getaddressesbyaccount ""
[
  "RJ8cuSGzBEVr7mD988tPVdMvTy2kgieJr6",
  "RNfviykgepoYjRL9ePcuHHuHJwxBGGVcgh",
  "RPCUimGv3pCz9wxErrtwJxFN713Uva57oH",

  "RXbSJSWangktGCmqWVxTjXTMQhXymYNryM",
  "RYYpCfudys4E3CAJyBq9KEv33NgCaiYoRw"
]
```
And then get a pubkey from each `validateaddress` for each address


[22-Dec-18 12:20 PM] TonyL#3577
If you want to have all `pubkey`'s


[22-Dec-18 12:20 PM] TonyL#3577
But you can start the daemon with any valid


[22-Dec-18 12:21 PM] SuSC135#6248
Oh!! I can try this and see if the address are valid . And then I can start daemon with one of these addresses and open a channel with any other address present in my assets chain


[22-Dec-18 12:23 PM] TonyL#3577
Exactly 👍 But start daemon not with address but pubkey. Or other way you can just get a valid address for your wallet any time by `getaccountaddress ""` without generating new one


[22-Dec-18 12:23 PM] TonyL#3577
In general `pubkey=` daemon param needed for any CC operating, not just channelsCC


[22-Dec-18 01:35 PM] SuSC135#6248
Is it necessary that daemon with the destination pubkey be running?


[22-Dec-18 01:47 PM] TonyL#3577
It shouldn't be necessary

Software version which you use most probably not compatible with current CC at all.

 `"connections": 0` also you have only one node now on your AC - so there is no nodes with which you can open your channel


[23-Dec-18 05:49 PM] TonyL#3577
```"blocks": 0,
  "longestchain": 0,```
On one of the nodes you might want to enable mining by `setgenerate true`

@SuSC135 being able to compile the latest version of whichever KMD branch you want, is going to be very valuable. Until you get that working, make sure to use the very latest binaries you can find, usually only a few days/weeks old, as they are make frequently


[24-Dec-18 05:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
@SuSC135 if you download (or already have the latest Agama wallet) and start Komodo in "native mode", that will actually start a full komodod process on your machine, and you can talk to it with komodo-cli


[24-Dec-18 05:27 AM] dukeleto#7326
even so, cryptoconditions stuff is very new, and you might need to compile a certain branch, like FSM or jl777


[24-Dec-18 03:05 PM] TonyL#3577
Also anyway to compile Windows binaries from custom branches Ubuntu needed, so it might be a good idea to switch to Ubuntu in general and test everything on it


[24-Dec-18 03:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
16.04 minimal server in VM gives a 10GB image.... install komodo into that... then clone it to test. No problem to boot 2-4 of them on a reasonable PC with VirtualBox and test anything you need. Can even use windows as a host if you must. I did that early on before getting linux host working.

the chown and chmod comand should sort out any permissions issues.


[24-Jan-19 05:42 PM] smkhound#7640
use `ls -al` to confirm folder ownership/permissions


[24-Jan-19 05:44 PM] smkhound#7640
On my rig, here's what it it looks like 
in /home/user folder:
`drwxrwxr-x 68 smk762 smk762 12288 Jan 25 01:41 .komodo`
in /home/user/.komodo folder
`drwxrwxr-x  6 smk762 smk762       4096 Jan 25 01:36 CFEKY`


[24-Jan-19 05:44 PM] smkhound#7640
substitute smk762 for your username

and CFEKY for the asset chain name you are spawning.


[24-Jan-19 05:48 PM] SuSC135#6248

if the `.komodo` folder is owned by root, you need to chown to make it owned by 'komodo'


[24-Jan-19 05:57 PM] SuSC135#6248
yup its owned by the root


[24-Jan-19 05:57 PM] smkhound#7640
best to chown recursive through the .komodo folder too or the same issues will come up again.


[24-Jan-19 06:00 PM] SuSC135#6248
I use this command only?

sudo chown -R komodo /home/komodo/*


[24-Jan-19 06:00 PM] SuSC135#6248
instead of komodo i do .komodo


[24-Jan-19 06:02 PM] smkhound#7640
` /home/komodo` is the user home folder.
` /home/komodo/.komodo` is the data folder.
if the data folder is owned by root, you cant create subfolders in it, even if all the files in it are owned by `komodo`


[24-Jan-19 06:17 PM] SuSC135#6248

you'll need to add `-gen` to the launch string

e.g. `./komodod -ac_name=HELLOWORLD -ac_supply=777777 -addnode=192.168.167.1 -gen &`

I used that command


[24-Jan-19 06:46 PM] smkhound#7640
use `komodo-cli -ac_name=EXAMPLECHAIN getinfo` to see how many blocks have been generated


[24-Jan-19 06:47 PM] smkhound#7640
if first node premine is 100 blocks, it'll take about 100 minutes

some of the guys in #kmdlabs  might be able to help 👍


[24-Jan-19 08:06 PM] Alright#0419
@SuSC135 you're using `-ac_name=HELLOWORLD` on both nodes, yes?


[24-Jan-19 08:06 PM] Alright#0419
`  "blocks": 0,` means block 1 was not mined


[24-Jan-19 08:07 PM] Alright#0419
once the nodes are connected, try `komodo-cli -ac_name=HELLOWORLD setgenerate true $(nproc)`


[24-Jan-19 08:13 PM] Alright#0419
you can do `komodo-cli -ac_name=HELLOWORLD getpeerinfo` to confirm they are connected

on small networks, longestchain might stay 0.   @Alright ?  look at screenshot

connections cant be 0 for mining


[25-Jan-19 12:23 AM] Alright#0419
@Mylo longestchain 0 is typically an indication of network having forks


[25-Jan-19 12:24 AM] Alright#0419
at least one of his nodes should show blocks >0 if it's working

my guess is that they are connected properly and neither started mining

port is p2p port and is shown in getinfo

oh yes I think port is not getting connected

firewall?


[25-Jan-19 11:33 PM] SuSC135#6248
I dont think its firewall issue. I checked the firewall. Is it because telnet is not installed in my system?


[26-Jan-19 02:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
Telnet is on every system, o e of your nodes must be behind Nat


[26-Jan-19 05:37 AM] dukeleto#7326
@SuSC135 if you can ping, but not other things, you probably have those TCP ports filtered by a firewall or one of the nodes itself


[26-Jan-19 05:38 AM] dukeleto#7326
you must open up the p2p ports on both nodes, and allow that port on any firewwall between them, too


[26-Jan-19 05:38 AM] dukeleto#7326
rpc port is usually only needed on localhost


[26-Jan-19 05:41 AM] dukeleto#7326
ping uses ICMP, which is often not filtered by firewalls


[26-Jan-19 09:58 AM] SuSC135#6248

I think for issue isolation you may totally disable firewall / allow all traffic in your local network rules - if it works it means issue is here and you can setup it proper then from scratch. If no - have to find problem somewhere else.


[26-Jan-19 10:36 AM] TonyL#3577
There are a lot of tools to check connectivity / network configuration such as proposed above `telnet` or let's say `traceroute` (possible to provide port as param to traceroute as well - so you'll see where traffic is not pass / blocked), `tcpdump` is very powerful as well


[27-Jan-19 07:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
@SuSC135 it's easy to use `curl` to verify a certain port is open


[27-Jan-19 07:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
curl will give different errors, based on whether the port is blocked, versus doing an invalid HTTP request against a p2p full node port


[27-Jan-19 07:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
use `curl -v`


[27-Jan-19 07:09 AM] dukeleto#7326
also make sure you are using the p2p port number, not the rpc port


[27-Jan-19 08:07 PM] SuSC135#6248
I did both traceroute and curl. It seems that the port 12562 is not bound to the ip address of the node.  its rather bound to 0.0.0.0:12562. Is there any way to change this?


[27-Jan-19 09:44 PM] cipi#4502
0.0.0.0 is OK, since it means it listens to all IPs that the node has... does the node have a public IP and not some private IPs? What is the IP of this node? `sudo ifconfig`


[27-Jan-19 09:57 PM] SuSC135#6248
I am running two VM in the same system and the IP address is 192.168.56.1


[27-Jan-19 10:01 PM] cipi#4502
ok, that is another story... seems the 2 VMs can't see each other because the host system does not route traffic from one VM to the other... but i am not familiar with VMs and how the host system must be configured to do that, since i don't use VMs


[27-Jan-19 10:05 PM] cipi#4502
i would google for something like "virtual switch VM"


[27-Jan-19 10:10 PM] cipi#4502
so basically both VMs must be in the same network, e.g. 192.168.x.x and be connected to the same "virtual switch"


[27-Jan-19 10:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
Fopr VMs I use a bridged adapter.... let your router give each VM its own IP...


[27-Jan-19 10:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
this then works every time... and you can Port Forward a port to internet to let outside nodes conenct aswell.


[27-Jan-19 10:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
With VirtualBox this is pretty easy, just chagne netowrk adapter to Bridged. Using QEMU its a bit tricky.


[28-Jan-19 05:16 AM] dukeleto#7326
@SuSC135 yeah, if you have VMs, you need to do extra work to allow them to get traffic


[28-Jan-19 05:17 AM] dukeleto#7326
i used vagrant in the past, and in the Vagrantfile, you can specify mapping a host port to a VM port


[28-Jan-19 05:17 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's the safest default for VMs to not be able to access the outside world, so that is usually the default

[29-Jan-19 12:43 AM] Mylo#8306
And tbh docker provides the least networking headaches in exchange for some docker tool fundamentals.

Networking is a layer too far down for most devs learning dev stuff, compared to a devops tool which is closer to a new dev workflow

just a quick question:


[20-Feb-19 03:57 PM] walrus#8604
I have set up an asset chain...on a remote aws node
say, that node is node 1
other nodes are joining in.....to that asset chain
previously node 1 was able to transfer coins to other nodes...but now whenever node 1 sends coins to other nodes....on other nodes logs it shows: ERROR: AcceptToMemoryPool: tx inputs not found
Transactions from other nodes are going through fine
But coin transfers from node 1 is not being accepted.
any idea what could be the reason?

what would you say about the future of blockchain with Python


[08-May-19 05:21 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
i have virtually no coding experience and Python seems a lot less daunting than C/C++


[08-May-19 05:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
python has it's own place in coding.
the best performance is expected from native/core programs, the ones compiles to binary, and that's mostly possible with core languages which are more efficient for this purpose than python.
python fits best for system admin stuff, and clients level code. so a client apps connecting to native code makes sense.


[08-May-19 05:24 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
so python would be used more for the front end development


[08-May-19 05:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

If using the wif of a ledger walllet address to claim rewards. 
Isnt it compromising your 24 word seed phrase? Since the privkeys(WIF) are derived from it and we get it using a bip39 tool. 
Its not possible to do this process in reverced? Find seed phrase from a WIF


[05-Jun-19 11:58 AM] gcharang#6833

@aume27Rrpmp.nft a seed phrase generates large numbers of WIFs, because a seed phrase represents a wallet. A WIF represents a single address. There is no way to go from information about a single address back to the seed phrase. Hope that helps explain a bit.

[10-Jun-19 04:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Ashwh to write a new CC, i.e. a new kind of smart contract, currently you must add C/C++ code. Once you have that type of contract, then it's just RPC calls to create/manage those kinds of contracts. We want this to be easier and more accessible


[10-Jun-19 04:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
if your needs fit a current CC, you don't need to do custom C/C++ development, just use existing RPCs

[10-Jun-19 04:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
we are looking for Go code that can make CC transactions, I believe, which is another kind of thing


[10-Jun-19 04:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
those are going to be raw transactions

{Reactions}
💯 

[10-Jun-19 04:59 PM] TonyL#3577
so in my understanding end-goal task might be separated on subtasks something like a: understand what CCs are, understand current implementation on C, think about best implementation way and design on Go, implement and add to current komodod compilation process


[10-Jun-19 04:59 PM] TonyL#3577

[10-Jun-19 05:05 PM] sja5225#5867
@TonyL and @dukeleto is there a library in python or any other language that eases the development of CC in that particular language? Other than c/c++


[10-Jun-19 08:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
No, its a petty large task to create all the needed links and helper functions to add a new language. I looked into lua, which seems useful, as u can create code by only restarting daemon rather than rebuilding it, but as things are still evolving at a low level, adding this new seems a massive waste of time. Just learn c++, its really not that hard.


[11-Jun-19 03:54 AM] dukeleto#7326
@sja5225 what exactly is your goal? I agree with blackjoker, in that pretty much whatever your goal is, doing it with C/C++ will probably be less work than trying to make it work in Go/etc. Potentially 10X or 100X less work


[11-Jun-19 03:54 AM] dukeleto#7326
i think we have a 25,000 KMD bounty if you can make raw CC xtns in Python or WASM. It's not an easy task

[11-Jun-19 07:26 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@dukeleto @Deleted User here's the context if it got mixed up in the conversations:
- @sja5225 made KMD client API package in go.
- Asked if there's anything else he can help Komodo project with any other dev work with his skills
- James asked if he can make a linkable library for Crypto-Conditions in Go language.

The intent is not the have a Go package doing RPC API calls to the CC made in C/C++ in `komodod`, the intent is to make the Go language devs possible to create a CC in Go language, which can be compiled to a library file to link to the komodod code, and used easily.

It is to extend the CC coding devbase to the other languages like Go language.

It might be big task, it I won't say anything to move away from this task to @sja5225 
Instead I highly encourage him to Go for it. Get help from your teachers/professors and from the devs here to understand what is going on under the hood in Komodo code and try to bridge it to Go language dev community.


[11-Jun-19 07:32 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
There are 2 things first I'd like to see:
- Calling the C functions from Go code and using them to make further application. It is indeed possible, since Go very much like Rust is friendly to work with C/C++. I am on/off work to move on my Go coding these days, some personal reasons, so just things are slow from my end. I'd love to see this basic thing work as code example. The target for @sja5225 can be to us Go language to call Crypto-Conditions specific methods/classes/functions from C/C++ code inside `komodod`. Use that to encrypt/decrypt transaction. I'm still weak in my C/C++ skills, so can't assist much, there are more devs here who can help @sja5225 🙂 

- The second task would be to make the functions/struct/methods/interfaces etc which are importable/callable in C/C++ code so that even if it makes it possible to  code the half or even the little partial part of the Crypto-Conditions logic in Go language it at least displays what is possible and set some example for others to extend that solution further in the language they understand better. For that I'd suggest @sja5225 to take a look at the "faucet" C code in FSM branch of jl777/komodo repo on GitHub.


[11-Jun-19 07:32 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@sja5225 I hope this helps clearer what is expected?


[11-Jun-19 07:34 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@sja5225 I have also made a KMD Go package sometime ago. It has some more automated things like not requiring RPC info from coder and just gets those from the .conf file automatically, and it is extend to be useable by any ecosystem smart chains in KMD ecosystem.

[11-Jun-19 07:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@sja5225 I see yours is doing things simple, and clear. I see you also had started making structs for the output values from RPC clients. 
I'd highly suggest you to sync the full node of KMD locally, and just do test each single API with your client package and then make another example go code to display the results in somewhat meaningful way, even just a printf would be fine.


[11-Jun-19 07:37 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm not entirely sure at level of skillets you are at with Go, so you can explore things further. I guess you have good help from your teachers, and they can help you there. I just learned much of the Go from online tutorials and moving slow with my learning and coding these days.


[11-Jun-19 07:44 AM] dukeleto#7326
@grewalsatinder @sja5225 i guess creating and parsing raw transactions in Go would be useful, i don't think anything does that yet


[11-Jun-19 07:47 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
there is crypto-conditions go packages as well as I last checked, and since the Komodo code uses C CC code, there are other libs/methods used in it as well.
since C/C++ is still my weaker point I could not go through Komodo code to identify where I need to call things from and what I would need to do which can make me possible to make Go language based CC code.


[11-Jun-19 07:47 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I do believe it must be possible to entirely make a CC dynamic lib in just  Go language, but for that for now I just understand that one has to understand both C/C++ code and Go code, and then initiate the CC work in Go.


[11-Jun-19 07:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
once the example is there, it'll be much helpful for others to follow.


[11-Jun-19 07:53 AM] sja5225#5867
Ok. @grewalsatinder if I got you right. I will need to make a library in golang that will enable developers to create CC. This can be achieved by CGO feature and linking the Komodo dynamic C library to golang library code. Yes C code can be linked directly to Golang code but I wouldn’t recommend C++. Ive has 5 months of internship experience at Tesla doing this. Ive been writing distributed systems and golang wrappers for C code.


[11-Jun-19 07:57 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, the end goal is to make a Go language code which works the same way as the `faucet` CC code works in C language.


[11-Jun-19 07:57 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
There are 2 types of CC code examples in FSM branch of jl777/komodo repo.


[11-Jun-19 08:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
1. The CC code written in C, which is compiled with the `komodod` and is available from within of `komodod`.
2. Same like 1, written in C, but compiles to an independent dynamic library, which sites right next to the `komodod` binary and is the `komodod` calls the RPC/API/methods from this library. It is the dynamic CC creation method, which doesn't need recompiling the whole `komodod` and only the CC code part. Makes the devs' life much better to only care about the CC code and also helps distribution of the CC to end users in updates when/if needed.


[11-Jun-19 08:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
You should check both examples of this inside compiled komodod CC code, and the dynamic linkable CC code which compiles to library file.


[11-Jun-19 08:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
What James asked is the 2nd option.


[11-Jun-19 08:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Just understand the 2nd way, dynamically linkable CC code lib, and try to make that in Go language 🙂


[11-Jun-19 08:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c can probably point where to look for it.


[11-Jun-19 08:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
there are 2 ways to do it, you can crete wrappers for the functions you need to call, or you can try to rewrite all of them in Go.

here. It requires to use the ccopt params, which places basically an op_return on the end of the cccvout itself. Then it needs the pubkeys in there, itlooks like it will see if the pubkey is in the wallet then sign the tx with that.

I just downloaded the source code. I'm getting include path errors. Is that expected? `/Users/ashwin/Documents/komodo/src/cryptoconditions/include/cryptoconditions.h:1:10: fatal error: 'cJSON.h' file not found
#include <cJSON.h>
         ^~~~~~~~~`


[12-Jun-19 03:14 PM] sja5225#5867
What should be the relative path for Komodo source?

I'm using macOS Mojave. When I use `brew link boost` I get an error `Linking /usr/local/Cellar/boost/1.70.0... 
Error: Could not symlink include/boost
/usr/local/include is not writable.`... Steps taken 1. `sudo chown -R $USER:admin /usr/local/include`


[13-Jun-19 09:11 AM] sja5225#5867
Does anybody face this same problem


[13-Jun-19 11:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
@sja5225 sounds like configuring problems in your homebrew. I am not sure that `chown` of /usr/local/include is what you want


[13-Jun-19 11:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
@sja5225 try `brew doctor`


[13-Jun-19 11:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
it detects and warns you of problems in your setup

@dukeleto brew doctor detects and warns errors. That is where I got the suggestion to ‘brew link’

right, komodo always compiles it's own version of boost, regardless of what is on your system


[14-Jun-19 07:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
@grewalsatinder maybe we should remove boost-dev from apt-get/mac install docs, if that is the case


[17-Jun-19 11:30 PM] jl777c#5810
depends on initial supply and mining rewareds, the PoS vs PoW doesnt change inflation rate

a fixed percentage is actually quite difficult to achieve, unless it is 0%

@Oszy , I using my own ac-name, newchain.

how did you start the daemon? do you have ` -daemon=1 -server=1` set ?


[30-Jun-19 09:31 AM] dante#7122
daemon=1 and server=1 in config

all my params in komodo.conf


[30-Jun-19 09:34 AM] Oszy#5734
rpcallowip should be your lan ip  if i recall correctly


[30-Jun-19 09:34 AM] dante#7122
ok let me try that


[30-Jun-19 09:36 AM] Oszy#5734
rpcallowip is only needed in special situations where one wants to allow the client/daemon to accept RPC connections outside the localhost


[30-Jun-19 09:41 AM] dante#7122
@Oszy should rpcbind be my LAN ip?


[30-Jun-19 09:42 AM] Oszy#5734
i don't think so. let me get python quick i'll try

if you declaring outside the function i don't know what can go wrong


[30-Jun-19 10:58 AM] Oszy#5734
try to do it with a config like mine, with your LAN ip set, or even rpcallowip completely removed for testing purposes


[30-Jun-19 10:58 AM] Oszy#5734
find out which one is the issue


[30-Jun-19 12:31 PM] dante#7122
Even if set rpc_port as 7776 in komodo.conf file, i dont understand why it starts the daemon on 8405

This https://pypi.org/project/komodorpc/ thing looks not actual (or maybe vice versa it's very fresh I just never saw it before 😃 )
I'm using this RPC client: https://github.com/barjomet/slick-bitcoinrpc
`pip3 install setuptools wheel slick-bitcoinrpc`

Then in your code:
```from slickrpc import Proxy
kmd_rpc_proxy = Proxy("http://%s:%s@127.0.0.1:%d"%(rpcuser, rpcpassword, int(rpcport))```

Just to clarify - is it komodod or FRESHCHAIN that is giving rpc of 8405?


[30-Jun-19 01:18 PM] TonyL#3577
@dante please note that RPC params for `FRESHCHAIN`  you need to set in `~/.komodo/FRESHCHAIN/komodo.conf` (not in `~/.komodo/komodo.conf`)
maybe it's a clue


[30-Jun-19 01:20 PM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
That may be ``~/.komodo/FRESHCHAIN/FRESHCHAIN.conf``

you are complaining about 7% deviation after 18 blocks??


[01-Jul-19 01:38 PM] jl777c#5810
it takes hundreds of blocks to reach the PoS target and in some cases it wont ever reach it, depends on hashrate, utxos, etc.


[01-Jul-19 01:38 PM] jl777c#5810
the first 100 blocks PoW is active

second bullet point


[01-Jul-19 01:46 PM] Alright#0419
staking vs notstaking in `getbalance64` is exactly what it sounds like


[01-Jul-19 01:47 PM] Alright#0419
eligible to stake vs not eligible to stake


[01-Jul-19 01:48 PM] Alright#0419
that number is garbage until block >100


[01-Jul-19 01:48 PM] Alright#0419
just meaningless garbage


[01-Jul-19 01:48 PM] Alright#0419
because it will tell you if you have eligible utxos or not


[01-Jul-19 01:49 PM] Alright#0419
I have a script that will do everything for you


[01-Jul-19 01:49 PM] Alright#0419
wrote it for exactly this kind of situation, it's hard to explain


[01-Jul-19 01:51 PM] Alright#0419
at block 10, it only takes 30 seconds for them to go from ineligible to eligible


[01-Jul-19 01:51 PM] Alright#0419
I don't understand what problem you're having


[01-Jul-19 01:51 PM] Alright#0419
it takes 30 seconds then a block*


[01-Jul-19 01:52 PM] Alright#0419
What is it you're trying to do?


[01-Jul-19 01:52 PM] Alright#0419
and what problem are you facing while doing it?


[01-Jul-19 01:52 PM] Alright#0419
ok if it stalled and there are no eligible utxos on the chain, you must restart it


[01-Jul-19 01:53 PM] Alright#0419
or invalidate a bunch of blocks and distribute after that


[01-Jul-19 01:53 PM] Alright#0419
you have no eligible utxos


[01-Jul-19 01:53 PM] Alright#0419
instead of "staking" it should say "eligible to stake" or something like this


[01-Jul-19 01:54 PM] Alright#0419
getbalance64 is likely garbage prior to block 2000, not sure would have to check out the code


[01-Jul-19 01:55 PM] Alright#0419
I didn't add that to the docs 😛


[01-Jul-19 02:01 PM] Alright#0419
I figured it was much easier for me to script it all then say "hey, use these scripts" than detailing every single little nook and cranny of it


[01-Jul-19 02:02 PM] Alright#0419
realistically, people are not creating ac_staked chains constantly, you really need some experience to understand how to create them


[01-Jul-19 02:02 PM] Alright#0419
so I just used my experience to create a script


[01-Jul-19 02:03 PM] Alright#0419
Look, I didn't add that to the docs 😫


[01-Jul-19 02:03 PM] Alright#0419
people add things without testing them all the time, this is why I've shied away from writing them


[01-Jul-19 02:04 PM] Alright#0419
I typically write everything in as much detail as possible then hand it over to @gcharang and @Bryan_Beus to do what they like with


[01-Jul-19 02:05 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I am summoned... how may I help?


[01-Jul-19 02:05 PM] Alright#0419
could you remove that line about getbalance64? 😂


[01-Jul-19 02:05 PM] Alright#0419
or explain what emman has said above


[01-Jul-19 02:05 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
help fill me in on what's going on...


[01-Jul-19 02:06 PM] Alright#0419
it won't work properly until block 100 or block 2000, not sure which, would have to test it


[01-Jul-19 02:06 PM] Alright#0419
easier to just remove it IMO, as it's not necessary to check that if you followed the rest of the doc


[01-Jul-19 02:07 PM] Alright#0419
`Use the getbalance64 method to ensure that there are coins in all 64 segids before block 10 (it doesn't matter on which list the utxos appear, "staking" or "notstaking").` this, sidd

what emman said is fine I guess, it's true, it won't matter if it shows it as staking or nonstaking as they will become eligible very quickly

[01-Jul-19 02:20 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Deleted User 

Does this solve your concern?

```
Use the getbalance64 method to ensure that there are coins in all 64 segids before block 10. The utxos may appear on any list, including both staking and nonstaking.
```


[01-Jul-19 02:20 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442

see what progamming libraries there are for the languages you know for KMD

and see if you can either improve those or if those doesn't exists, may be make those for devs like yourself who might use them

> Hey guys, what's the best IDEs you recommend on Mac OS?  I'M new to programming
Sorry for necroing, but I've spend quite a long time trying to do some actual C++ deving on macOS.
I'd say that CLion works best, and its best side is that it's multiplatform so you can use it on Windows/Linux too.
I really love Qt Creator, but I've had lots of troubles setting it up on Mac (that was partly because our project used a customized CMake)
And of course, there's xCode, but IMHO that's not very good.

Hii , Iam a gradute student from UTA, I have taken blockchain course under Professor Sajib Datta. So, we were asked to contact the development team. We were asked to do a project on komodo platform. So,Iam thinking of creating a web application which is used for payments by users,coins are  transferred between users.and also how to integrate komodo API in any programming language.As of now I can only see komodo CLI which interacts with the assert chain i have created in my local machine.

@srikala21 hey sorry I didn't see this here! welcome, congratulations on the course! @PTYX ^^

What languages do you prefer to use? right now there are a few unofficial wrappers to interact with the Komodod RPCs from the CLI. 

Here's some GO Lang docs from

@srikala21 you can talk to the asset chain via RPC calls, like curl or use any of the wrappers above.

I didn't find any errors, but it hasn't been tested extensively. it should be better than writing a wrapper from scratch. you can fork it and make changes if you find any mistakes. I will accept if you send PRs that make the wrapper better

@yumyumdumdum do you mean every transaction on the chain pays out a reward to all the existing addresses?

> @gcharang is it possible to create a chain where every time a payment or money is transacted into a certain address an evenly distribution is given to all the other coins of that chain as a reward?
@yumyumdumdum you need to know that address-generation is local-only and there is no way to know how many addresses have been generated except ones that have at least 1 incoming tx


[14-Aug-20 06:30 AM] dukeleto#7326
and if there are 1,000,000 addresses with balance, you can't pay out to all of them in 1 tx


[14-Aug-20 06:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
in theory, for small numbers of addresses, you could write a consensus rule for it, but it will be quite slow, since every tx on the network will need to check against a huge list of addresses with funds. It's not scalable


[14-Aug-20 06:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
but it is possible to build for small numbers of addresses

[14-Aug-20 06:54 PM] daemonfox#6136
That mints blocks when the parent chain does, and would mint the relative coins defined on the sub chains.

But, that isnt tx mirroring...


[14-Aug-20 06:55 PM] daemonfox#6136
I believe that is what the Gateway protocols in Verus will be responsible for.

Should be able to feed multiple chains off of a gateway chain.

@daemonfox people realized merge mining was a bad idea long ago, not sure why Mike hasn't gotten the message. I don't follow VRSC/PBaaS, tho I was one of the first miners/contributors to the project. I do not agree with Mike's "vision" and also, VRSC has no privacy features, it's focused on PoS, which I completely deleted from Hush

> @dukeleto ok... i feel like the old merged mining from previous coins and algos is not the same as what Mike has put together as an option. Its less a "oh this coin takes the same solution too" and more a design choice from the start, to ensure mineable sub chains also move when the parent chain moves, as well as be independently mineable to move on their own.

{Reactions}
💯 

[15-Aug-20 07:26 AM] daemonfox#6136
Also what defines a privacy feature? VRSC has z transactions, but haven;t built much of anything else onto that foundation. While it is "focused" on PoS, the PoW isnt going anywhere, its still ~ half and both will be options with selective PoS rates for the new chains coming out.


[15-Aug-20 07:26 AM] daemonfox#6136
Is PoS really that bad it had to be completely gutted from Hush?


[15-Aug-20 07:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
@daemonfox in my opinion, yes. It's anti-privacy


[15-Aug-20 07:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
you must store funds in a transparent address and tell the entire world all your details and addresses and amounts to stake


[15-Aug-20 07:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
that is anti-privacy

VRSC doesn't even correctly do DPoW, because Mike doesn't want to use my code, which is childish


[15-Aug-20 07:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
he hobbles his own coin because of personal beef, and doesn't like it when i mention there is custom code in VRSC to deal with the fact that Mike lost his first VRSC wallet.dat

"Verus was the first project to port ZCash’s (ZEC) Sapling technology. Sapling made Z transactions (a very effective kind of privacy transaction) efficient enough to be much more practical for exchanges and much more useable in wallets. And Verus didn’t just port Sapling for itself. Komodo commissioned Verus developers to contribute Sapling code to the entire Komodo ecosystem, which made projects like Pirate (ARRR) much more efficient, and made Pirate’s pitch that exchanges should support Z to Z transactions— totally private coin transfers — much more compelling. So, thanks to ZCash, Pirate, Komodo, and Verus, all of the projects in the Komodo ecosystem have the ability to implement much faster Z transactions and we all have options for exchanges that support Z to Z. That’s pretty useful."  https://medium.com/@letterswrites/what-verus-did-and-what-its-doing-dbaaf1eec759

you are making up reasons to why i did that. i typically take little time to make improvements after i find out about something. it was a performance issue as there was no need to have that code for non-VRSC chains. please dont equate the speed that i work with anything else than i am fast.

code that does something that is announced it will be doing, is not a backdoor by my definition. again, you disagree and state that something that was announced would be done, that was then done, is a backdoor.

then I would like to be able to run the app on different port thanks to axios and .env variables (for this to be grafted to another AC project) and run the app with a (npm run kmd | | npm run tokel | | npm run arrr || ...)
Once this, comment out the code properly and why not add external documents
I do it a bit by feeling, it allows me to improve myself

And so that in the near future (I hope) restart the entire API in RUST
