#kmdice KMDICE is a blockchain that has dice implemented and has done a lot of testing, might be nice to point that out

`"Foreteller" - guess a card game based on DiceCC`

52 cards deck guessing game. 

Using DiceCC RNG as a main one which affect a game result and non on-chain RNG just for result visual representation.

Game modes:

1) Guess a suit: choose a spade, club, diamond or heart (actually placing a bet with odds 3 - 1:4)

2) Guess a card value: choose 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, A (actually placing a  bet with odds 12 - 1:13)

3) Guess a card: choose exact card value + suit (actually placing a  bet with odds 51 - 1:52)

If diceCC bet result "won" - showing a random card (chosen by non blockchain simple RNG) from cards which match player prediction

If diceCC bet result "loss" - showing a random card (chosen by non blockchain simple RNG) from cards which not match player prediction

cool idea! using the odds to generate a new game play


[28-Jan-19 01:09 PM] TonyL#3577
Thanks for feedback! @Meyse made some cool graphics and I'll try to implement it in Python GUI in a next few weeks. I have all betplacing GUI logic implemented already as part of previous plays (table choosing / creation, buttons, odds choosing sliders and etc) - just have to make proper layout mostly

Not predetermined only in player mind


[12-Mar-19 10:26 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
It seems it would work well as a standardized tool to collect data and prevent fraud in the results and to id a player anonymously if there is a ‚Äúanomaly‚Äù I am a determinist too, for the most part but have run into things I couldn‚Äôt explain so the strange stuff of parapsychology intrigued me  .


[12-Mar-19 10:29 PM] TonyL#3577
Clue is that diceCC returning only won or lose but GUI can wrap this result to specific card/color so player can start to build systems or something


[12-Mar-19 10:30 PM] TonyL#3577
Should be interesting stuff yep, sad that I have other things in priority at the moment but as I know GUI for this game is in work by @Meyse

the kmdice project and this cc-dice project? Are they one and the same or am I misunderstsnding? It seems like the kmdice channel is more technical and covers mining while this channel covers gameplay UI?


[17-Mar-19 10:08 PM] TonyL#3577
Kmdice is DiceCC testchain with bounty funds locked in DiceCC betting plan (as far as I know).
This channel is for dice cryptoconditions consensus module discussing.

We need to add major betting sports that ZenSports (and others) isn't already covering.  I would like to see if we could make a mobile betting app that could  cover Japanese cycling races  (Keirin ).  It is one of the largest betting sports in Japan, a nation that bets more on sports than any other.

hi, I was going through the cc-dice documents, I think there is a little mistake at https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/cryptoconditions/cc-dice.html#dicefund 
the arguments order should be `minbet` then `maxbet`

@Mylo dealer must do it before timeout


[04-Apr-19 07:23 PM] Alright#0419
after timeout, I'm not sure if bettor must do it or anyone can do it


[04-Apr-19 07:23 PM] Alright#0419
`The dicefinish method rebroadcasts a bet that was previously broadcast.` this is wrong though I believe


[04-Apr-19 07:24 PM] Alright#0419
dicefinish is when dealer reveals entropy and whether or not it was a win/lose, so not everyone can do that


[04-Apr-19 07:24 PM] Alright#0419
if dealer doesn't do it within timeout timeframe, bettor gets a default win if the bettor does dicefinish

[18-Oct-19 02:23 AM] gcharang#6833
@PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator someone needs to use 
```
dicefund name funds minbet maxbet maxodds timeoutblocks
```
to create a contract first (i.e. atleast 2 nodes are needed)

then you can use those details to place bets


[18-Oct-19 02:26 AM] gcharang#6833
oh, you mentioned KMDICE!

I'm reading through the dice docs and have a couple questions regarding utxos.
`To create a "house" contract, use dicefund to initiate the contract, and then add several utxos to the fund with diceaddfunds.`
Does anyone have any more info to share about this? Like should the several utxo's be small like `0.0001` for tx fees? If so will this it always be necessary to fund with these payments or will the main funding from `dicefund` be used to pay txfees and as well as winners payouts?


[12-Oct-20 06:43 PM] lightspeed393#5403
maybe @siu or @jorian can share some knowledge from #kmdice


[12-Oct-20 07:43 PM] Mylo#8306
i think it is to kickstart it, in case of wins.  but as people play against the house, the house gets more utxos.  but i'm not sure.


[12-Oct-20 07:44 PM] Mylo#8306
there is a bug in this module, but i'm not sure what it is.  so don't do anything crazy with it


[12-Oct-20 07:56 PM] lightspeed393#5403
Thanks for the info @Mylo my next question was going to be, is there a bug or issue. I'm just playing around though, maybe I'll come across it.

i think.  i can't remember. so...really i don't know. my ego is fishing my memory for an answer üòÑ


[13-Oct-20 12:19 AM] jl777c#5810
the "bug" was actually an intentional feature. the dice CC wasnt designed to have a single giant pool, as that requires a lot of processing and things halt if that node is not running. so i made a provision that allowed to extract funds to a different address. after the funds were diverted, the idea was to patch this, but before that happened the chain wasnt actively used for a while so was ignored. then many months later it was started again and someone discovered how to extract funds. and did


[13-Oct-20 12:20 AM] jl777c#5810
so the "bug" can be fixed, but the fundamental. design of dice CC is not practical. it was more a demo of how to do things with the mempool,  but of course that makes things. very tricky. if dice CC used only confirmed transactions, then. it would be much more robust and scalable. but it wouldnt be instant

thanks.   yes.  NOT a bug.

[13-Oct-20 04:30 AM] Mylo#8306
apologies


[13-Oct-20 05:46 AM] jl777c#5810
should be a simple fix to add a check to prevent that, but it will still be having. the. centralized dealer, so as it is dice CC is an interesting mempool demo,  but i would not be using it for production


[13-Oct-20 05:57 AM] Mylo#8306
imo if there are 1000+ new discord ppl coming with the atomicdex stress test, having a cool little side app to engage with might be worth it.
if it were magically fixed, centralized dealer is fine.
if it were up to me, the blockchain would start with -ac_pubkey and use some kind of faucet, remove the monetary value from it and make it just a fun thing to play with.

if there are people willing to become house nodes, send them more funds.


[13-Oct-20 06:05 AM] lightspeed393#5403
thanks for the feedback james appreciate it.


[13-Oct-20 06:16 AM] jl777c#5810
if it has no monetary value, then. it seems having a way to drain funds that are not worth anything is not a big problem


[13-Oct-20 06:16 AM] jl777c#5810
but i would definitely recommend to not put 100% of all the chains funds into a single plan!


[13-Oct-20 06:28 AM] lightspeed393#5403
I was just reading through KMDICE bitcointalk thread and it seemed people were excited about on chain dice so I was playing around and considering starting a table on SPACE, but I'm going to hold off now. It's not worth much now, but I'd rather not have the chance of funds extracted.


[13-Oct-20 06:44 AM] Mylo#8306
Of course...great! No loss.
