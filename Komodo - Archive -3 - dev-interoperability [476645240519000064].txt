Hi, could someone please explain interoperability in the context of this channel?


[03-Oct-18 12:35 AM] CrisF#3405
Anything to do with clusters?


[03-Oct-18 12:39 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
I think it's a new tech to be announced, recently there was an image posted in marketing with an obvious spoiler

ETH was being notarised to KMD... maybe that something... but thats anoher libscott project so I guess we are waiting for him to come back on that one too, my eth notarizer stopped working on latest update.


[03-Oct-18 12:43 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
The spoiler was "Interchain bridges" or something similar, prob interoperability w non-KMD based blockchains

@ミカ 🎗 🅼🅸🅲🅰🅷 | ❤😈🎵 use crypto-conditions.   Send the block reward to a crypto condition address then you can do your DoI-SMS thing at any stage.   There’s a response back in the pioneers discord

@ミカ 🎗 🅼🅸🅲🅰🅷 | ❤😈🎵 all good man.  but yes, don't be so hasty in leaving after posting useful info - ya never know when ppl will respond.   the google doc much more useful for my reading than the medium post (less reading, straight to details).

OK - what crypto conditions (CC) allows you to do is make custom consensus.  so in the case of DoI-SMS, mine to a CC address (a "smart contract" but more powerful because of it's capabilities) and then redistribute based on whatever algorithm you use.

Perhaps the best way to move foward at the moment is:
 - pick any programming language
 - simulate the distribution in a loop (e.g. for loop, while etc.)
 - print out the stats to a file (e.g. csv or json)
 - have a pretty graphs (either using excel, d3 or plotly) to show what actually happens
 - be able to modify the parameters in the loop

This exercise will give you uncomplicated programming practise.

When another programmer can see what is going on, to port it to say C++ would be much easier to collaborate than to try and implement it from just a whitepaper of sorts.

Collaboration is key and so is looking after yourself.   We are all in it for the long game, the debt is just a number - as long as it is managed.  If management of that to you is paying it all out over 3-6 months - great.   If it's a 5 year loan at $50/month, cool.

All the best in the drive etc.

Hmmmm I wonder if you are deleted user Calem, cannot mention you.
I remember jl777 saying that the different block reward eras could make and approximate curve.
Verus coin had an interesting launch and block rewards locking feature for the early miners.  Currently BR are 24 and not locked.

I’m not sure the block reward is the place for your DoI-SMS tbh.  Using a crypto condition, it would be able to lock block rewards and redistribute them according to anything you want, over time in portions to the miner, or according to off-chain data oracle-ized shared out (again over time and also cumulatively recalculate this period) like mining pool shares, to spread the distribution or “water down” the concentration of high payout BR to early miners.
```
👆 from the pioneers discord


[14-Oct-18 04:10 AM] jl777c#5810
changing blockreward is easily done by making changes to the blockreward function. no need for any complex CC


[14-Oct-18 04:15 AM] Mylo#8306
I think i read DoI-SMS in the context of the BR being shared out, and my thoughts went to the infographic competition - where some of the prize money (5x100KMD) went to other ppl.  So in the case of miners with BR, they can be diffused to other parties involved.   Maybe i am complicating it.

Whats the status on this?
I am assuming this is the RPC I would need to use to verify a tx from another chain on a chain? Say a list of notarisation txids is sent to an oracle, I can use this RPC to make sure that each notarisation actually happened?

Hi I am an active member of Zclassic Community, 

I am looking for a solution to use Callisto-Network Smart-Contracts from our Blockchain to design an Hybrid-Ecosystem around or main core. I designed a solution including a Side-chain connected with the Atomic-swaps but I would like to check the feasibility of the project I designed.


[09-Aug-19 07:47 AM] lelonex#7376
Who's can help me to study the possibility to use Komodo interoperability to achieve the goal?


[09-Aug-19 07:52 AM] lelonex#7376
ps.: I am mainly interested to understand the possibility to convert the token/info in both direction Zclassic <[Komodo]> Callisto


[09-Aug-19 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
it callisto supports CLTV opcode, it should work with atomicDEX, but i remember one of the zclassic type of coins changed all their vouts to need some strange extra data. if ZCL is one of those it is nonstandard and would require a special handling


[09-Aug-19 07:55 AM] lelonex#7376
@jl777c it is similar Zcash, we share the same code


[09-Aug-19 07:58 AM] jl777c#5810
then it should just work


[09-Aug-19 07:58 AM] lelonex#7376
we need to write a slice of system to evolve community in developement partecipation without changing the main purpose of the chain: keeping Zclassic 100% community driven

@jl777c what kind of info a swap can share between blockchain to have a full interoperability? Is it possible to interact to a Smart-contract of a specific foreign blockchain? 

ex. If I would like to interact with Callisto ChainLink hub from Zclassic.. can I use Atomic-Swaps as a "proxy" to route disposal to a specific contract on the foreign blockchain?


[10-Aug-19 03:45 AM] jl777c#5810
probablly not. atomicDEX is designed to do cross chain swaps of coins

Silly question but what do you use the smart contract for? Why not just use komodo CC on a new chain that you migrate to?

Hello @polycryptoblog , i just wrote an email as advised upper.

As far as i understand there's a PR to make in jl777/coins repo.
I see what to do, except the swaps/KMD-D4RK.md file (i suppose there has to be a first successful swap tx if i understand).

May you share the procedure so i can initiate a correct PR please ?
Thanks and keep up the good -decentralized- work !

To get integrated you will need to complete a swap with the coin.  The required info needed for you to make a swap locally is in the link above.  Once that is done it can be added to desktop version.  For mobile version there is a cost.  You can email partners@komodoplatform.com for any followup questions or if you are looking for mobile integration as well


[22-Feb-21 01:14 PM] collars#0538
that's great,  thanks  for the info  👍 

for desktop version integration,  does that need done by the core team?  is there a process for that after the initial swap completion?

for mobile version,  do you know the price?


[22-Feb-21 01:22 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
For desktop just need to submit the pull request.  For mobile integration cost is 6500$ +1k a year maintenance

What steps would I need to take given this scenario:

1. I have my own blockchain using Komodo that has it's own coin FISHCOIN
2. I have a token on my chain called TROUT
3. I want to swap in BEP20 tokens from BSC to my chain, where I then swap the BSC tokens for either TROUT or FISHCOIN

I'm unclear about how I would bridge the BSC tokens to my blockchain. Would the BEP20 tokens just be a tokenized representation of the real BEP20 tokens on the BSC chain?

How could I take ownership of those BEP20 tokens?

(My project has already publicly offered BEP20 tokens but I want to get them off BSC and onto Komodo but we need a mechanism to swap in existing token holders etc.)


[14-Jun-21 10:40 PM] Mylo#8306
i think it's BEP20 token -> native smartchain COIN


[14-Jun-21 10:40 PM] Mylo#8306
i am also looking to do the same thing with a group of people with a game.


[14-Jun-21 10:40 PM] Mylo#8306
BEP20 is for liquidity


[14-Jun-21 10:40 PM] Mylo#8306
KMD smartchain for game


[15-Jun-21 02:35 AM] gcharang#6833
Atomicdex allows you trade BEP20 tokens vs KMD smart chain coins.
so,  create 1:1 maker orders for  FISHCOIN vs BEP20 token on Atomicdex. then, you can create on-chain orders for Trout vs Fishcoin


[15-Jun-21 07:48 AM] cipi#4502
keep in mind that txes on BEP20 still cost something, even if it's only 5-15 cents, but if you need to do lots of transactions, you are still better off with UTXO coins


[15-Jun-21 07:52 AM] cipi#4502
does not look like the KMD concept with the assetchains will get any competition in terms of transaction fees

Hello, how can i develop AMM defi like pancakeswap using komodo Atomicswap API? Assuming user can easily set the liquidity pool like pancakeswap, no installation

AMM functionality is not available in AtomicDEX currently. AtomicDEX deals with only cross chain swaps right now and that doesn't lend itself to a easy AMM like system

Thanks. Could u suggest the idea about how to lend itself easily?

Hey Everyone.  Is anyone working on an EVM interface for Komodo chains?  We switched to Komodo nearly two years ago (were attracted by a number of features, but interoperability was high in our list), but it seems as though we're now at a disadvantage due to no evm support.

I'm actually considering switching again 🤦‍♂️

That article is from a couple of years ago, and smartchain dev has been progressing smoothly.
If you have a specific operation you are looking to implement, it's likely that it can be developed, you just need to ask the right questions and talk to the right developers.
