This looks interesting.


[08-Mar-19 03:35 PM] Alright#0419
@CrisF heh, don't think it's any different than the momom you've been playing with for months


[08-Mar-19 04:29 PM] CrisF#3405
Haha, then it's definitely interesting :2561_feelsevilman:

I thought MoMoM wasn't CC.


[08-Mar-19 04:31 PM] Alright#0419
it's a unique CC, but still a CC

No we are using the same solution created by libscott. I just fixed it spo that its reliable. I need to verify with someone that knows hwo it works that how I fixed it is safe... Had a long chat with libscott today about it and he seemsed to think my solution is fine. But he also doesnt quite understand how it works, despite writing msot of the code for it. üòÇ

@dimxy I am documenting the `selfimport` rpc and can't make it work
Started the chain:
```
./komodod -ac_name=TESTIMPORT -ac_import=PUBKEY -ac_pubkey=0257e1074b542c47cd6f603e3d78400045df0781875f698138e92cb03055286634 -ac_supply=777777 -ac_reward=100000000 
```
and 
```
./komodod -ac_name=TESTIMPORT -ac_import=PUBKEY -ac_pubkey=0257e1074b542c47cd6f603e3d78400045df0781875f698138e92cb03055286634 -ac_supply=777777 -ac_reward=100000000 -datadir=/home/gcharang/coinData/TESTIMPORT -addnode=localhost -pubkey=0257e1074b542c47cd6f603e3d78400045df0781875f698138e92cb03055286634
```

imported privkey for the pubkey into the second chain
selfimport:
```
gcharang@qa-gcharang1:~/komodo/src$ ./komodo-cli -ac_name=TESTIMPORT -datadir=/home/gcharang/coinData/TESTIMPORT selfimport RM9n6rts1CBKX4oXziLp1WBBgEUjKKWHb3 100000
error code: -1
error message:
Failed creating selfimport template tx
```

`-testnode=1` @gcharang will allow you to run a network with a single node

no need to do that double node thing anymore


[10-May-19 10:24 AM] dimxy#2587
@gcharang  Okay, I'll check it

@gcharang  seems in my test chain selfimport works.
Please note that the amount is in  coins (not satoshis)
could you also paste  server messages , if any, marked as GetSelfimportProof() ... or CheckVinPubkey()... at the beginning?


[10-May-19 12:37 PM] dimxy#2587
one possible problem could be if you have several  privkeys in your wallet and it was used not the ac_pubkey=<pubkey>


[10-May-19 10:47 PM] gcharang#6833
@dimxy 
sorry for the wrong report, I have started the chain using two different nodes and tried it again, it's working as expected

It must be, I messed up something when using the two nodes in a single system using different datadirs method


[11-May-19 01:59 AM] dimxy#2587
Great! Feel free to ask me you need to know about this api or suggest improvements

@dimxy just had another problem:

```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKHOUND getwalletburntransactions
error: couldn't parse reply from server
```


[11-May-19 03:24 AM] gcharang#6833
I have edited and added examples for your crosschain doc: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/developer-docs/blob/gcharang/docs/basic-docs/komodo-api/crosschain.md
@dimxy 
except for `getwalletburntransactions`, please go through it when you have some time and suggest edits if required

Yes i'll check this, thank you

@gcharang  hello,
I think to catch this getwalletburnntransactions problem I'd need all rpc calls you did on this chain or simply your wallet (where those txns should be now). I think this could be a problem emerged after merging my and Mihailo migration code (I have not yet tested this getwalletburntransactions rpc with his new burn txns for coda protocol)


[12-May-19 07:15 PM] gcharang#6833
@dimxy 
The chain is `CFEKHOUND`, which  has been active for more than a week in the KMDLabs cluster, it has same `ac_cc` as `CFEKDRAGON`

```
  {
    "ac_name": "CFEKDRAGON",
    "ac_supply": "200",
    "ac_reward": "1000000000",
    "ac_nk": "77,3",
    "ac_notarypay": "100000000",
    "ac_cc": "533",
    "addnode": [
       "103.6.12.112",
       "149.28.8.219",
       "45.76.120.247"
    ]
  },
  {
    "ac_name": "CFEKHOUND",
    "ac_supply": "200000",
    "ac_reward": "1000000000",
    "ac_nk": "77,3",
    "ac_notarypay": "100000000",
    "ac_cc": "533",
    "addnode": [
       "195.201.20.230",
       "195.201.137.5",
       "149.28.8.219",
       "103.6.12.112",
       "45.76.120.247"
    ]
  }
```
I have tested crosschain migration on them with CFEKHOUND as source chain, so I have used all the rpc in https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/developer-docs/blob/gcharang/docs/basic-docs/komodo-api/crosschain.md except for `selfimport` in the CFEKHOUND chain

the rest of the rpc I have used are too many to remember as this node has been active a long time and is a Notary in the KMDLabs
I can provide the `wallet.dat` if that would be helpful

The wallet.dat will be very helpful as I do not know what the transaction causes the error

```- MoMoM
  - Insert MoMoM CC proof of concept here - [link]```

Hey all, if you have any proof of concepts, or built something cool for MoMoM CC, please let me know. The goal is to build out a list of concepts using CCs to help show other developers what is possible and add this to the Komodo docs page. TUIs are good too!


[03-Nov-19 03:55 PM] CrisF#3405
@Regnar We tested MoMoM extensively in Labs with cross-chain migrations.  No GUI, but might be good to add that to the list of reference GUIs to create.  That one might not be so difficult (?).
