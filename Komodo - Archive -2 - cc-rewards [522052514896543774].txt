I know that Equaliser is working on getting rewards out


[11-Dec-18 11:04 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Who is coding those contracts?


[11-Dec-18 11:14 AM] TonyL#3577
@Cryptoon Rewards CC is one of the initial CC consensus modules (aka CC contracts) on Komodo platform developed by @jl777c


[11-Dec-18 11:18 AM] TonyL#3577
Actually all current working modules are developed by JL except of ChannelsCC which is a brilliant job of @Mihailo


[11-Dec-18 11:19 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Ahaa, was more asking who is editing the cc's for them


[11-Dec-18 11:19 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I assume it's not just plug and play and you still need a dev to code them?


[11-Dec-18 11:20 AM] TonyL#3577
It depends of your needs - if current one is suits your needs you can just activate it on your asset chain and use it by RPC calls


[11-Dec-18 11:20 AM] TonyL#3577
If you need some conceptual/consensus customisation - in this case source code rework needed


[11-Dec-18 11:23 AM] TonyL#3577
In general as a dAPP developer you can use CC module just as a magic box (you have  human readable RPC calls with predicted and expected outputs and may dont care mostly what going on on vins/vouts level)

Not sure tbh what Equaliser do ☺


[12-Dec-18 02:16 AM] Cryptoon#3362
They want masternodes iirc


[12-Dec-18 02:17 AM] jl777c#5810
why do they want masternodes? to actually add a second layer of priviledged nodes, or to just lock funds and get rewards?


[12-Dec-18 02:44 AM] Cryptoon#3362
the latter I think


[12-Dec-18 02:44 AM] Cryptoon#3362
support price perhaps


[12-Dec-18 03:00 AM] jl777c#5810
then rewards CC does what is needed


[27-Feb-19 08:50 AM] dukeleto#7326
Hush plans to enable the rewards CC, please let me know if there are any consensus changes coming soon

🆒

@dukeleto how would you fund rewards plans?


[27-Feb-19 12:41 PM] Alright#0419
I think rewards is solid, but I imagine any significant bugs that would be found would be hard forks. Hate to sound like a shill, but probably worth while to wait and run some incentivized tests with it on LABS. Either that or do some thorough testing of it yourself


[27-Feb-19 12:42 PM] Alright#0419
have you considered using two fungible momom chains?


[27-Feb-19 12:42 PM] Alright#0419
one that will hard fork as often as needed, one that will rarely hardfork


[28-Feb-19 12:12 AM] dukeleto#7326
given the above, maybe Rewards is just a nice-to-have for Hush, it's not our focus. haven't thought of multiple chains, the main reason Hush is becoming an AC is for sapling, so if any CC stuff makes it harder/more work, it will be left for a future upgrade


[26-Mar-19 02:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
Found a pretty bad bug with rewards


[26-Mar-19 02:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
Im not sure why its been done, but the recover funds is not working at all... if for any reason imputs are not found, and this could be for many reasons... Then its just returning the locked funds


[26-Mar-19 02:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
It needs to actaully check all teh conditions are met before releasing this recover thing... IMO recover shouldnt be there... doesnt seem like it was designed to have it. Doesnt seem any simple fix.


[26-Mar-19 02:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
Seems rewards would need a major redesign to fix this problem.


[26-Mar-19 02:27 AM] jl777c#5810
what do you mean? which tx, which case


[26-Mar-19 02:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
at any time it cannot find inputs it just does the recover transaction. This means its skipping minseconds checks and many other things


[26-Mar-19 02:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
I cant fix the validation properly...


[26-Mar-19 02:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
because the RPC is wrong


[26-Mar-19 02:30 AM] jl777c#5810
what is the recover transaction?


[26-Mar-19 02:30 AM] jl777c#5810
you mean unlock?


[26-Mar-19 02:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
I dont really understand why it is there


[26-Mar-19 02:30 AM] jl777c#5810
please be more specific and dont jump to conclusions


[26-Mar-19 02:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
it seems that if there are not enogh inputs to pay the reward, weather that be becasuse not locked long enough ... or they actually are not there  it will just send a recover tx.


[26-Mar-19 02:31 AM] jl777c#5810
what line of code?


[26-Mar-19 02:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
it needs to at the very least make sure the minimum requirments are met before sending this tx, but the checks for these requirments are deeper inisde other  loops with no easy way of returning an error to stop this tx being sent


[26-Mar-19 02:32 AM] jl777c#5810
but it is rpc level, so even if the code is changed, anybody could issue the same tx


[26-Mar-19 02:32 AM] Deleted User#0000
which is why I dont understand why there is a secondary validation for this... its skipping all teh requirement checks


[26-Mar-19 02:32 AM] Deleted User#0000
it needs to check all these first ... then bail out


[26-Mar-19 02:32 AM] Deleted User#0000
not bail before its checked them


[26-Mar-19 02:33 AM] jl777c#5810
so it is just not adding the reward as a "better to recover the funds, than nothing at all"


[26-Mar-19 02:33 AM] jl777c#5810
what line of code is skipping the validation?


[26-Mar-19 02:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
its not one line of code


[26-Mar-19 02:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
its the whole thing


[26-Mar-19 02:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
lol


[26-Mar-19 02:34 AM] jl777c#5810
the fix i suggested was for the case where there are no rewards, that the destination address needs to sign a vin


[26-Mar-19 02:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
`if ( (inputs= AddRewardsInputs(ignore,0,cp,mtx,rewardspk,reward+txfee,30,sbits,fundingtxid)) >= reward+txfee )`
`else`
```// This should be checking that minseconds has passed... looks like clear bug!
                    firstmtx.vout.push_back(CTxOut(amount-txfee,scriptPubKey));
                    //CCerror = "cant find enough rewards inputs";
                    fprintf(stderr,"not enough rewards funds to payout %.8f, recover mode tx\n",(double)(reward+txfee)/COIN);
                    return(FinalizeCCTx(-1LL,cp,firstmtx,mypk,txfee,EncodeRewardsOpRet('U',sbits,fundingtxid)));```


[26-Mar-19 02:35 AM] jl777c#5810
that way, some random third party cant close out existing rewards


[26-Mar-19 02:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think it just needs to not be there ...


[26-Mar-19 02:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
doesnt make a lot of sense


[26-Mar-19 02:35 AM] jl777c#5810
the rewards calc is done above


[26-Mar-19 02:36 AM] jl777c#5810
if the reward was more than txfee, then and only then does it try this


[26-Mar-19 02:36 AM] jl777c#5810
if the rewards inputs are not therem then the rewards fund is depleted and it is reasonable to just recover the funds


[26-Mar-19 02:37 AM] jl777c#5810
so in the recover case, add a normal vin and have the validation make sure the destination pubkey has a vin, not sure why you are freaking out over this


[26-Mar-19 02:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
no but it wont find any inputs if minseconds hasnt passed


[26-Mar-19 02:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
so then it sends the funds out.... when they are not allwoed to be released


[26-Mar-19 02:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
Does that make sense?


[26-Mar-19 02:37 AM] jl777c#5810
the rewards calc would be 0


[26-Mar-19 02:37 AM] jl777c#5810
it wouldnt go into that if statement


[26-Mar-19 02:38 AM] Deleted User#0000
but the validation isnt checking it... I thaught this was what Alright was going on about how he was able to steal funds...


[26-Mar-19 02:38 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, we need to add validation


[26-Mar-19 02:38 AM] Deleted User#0000
both need to check the same thing... this recover tx isnt right


[26-Mar-19 02:39 AM] jl777c#5810
make sure minseconds has passed and add a destpubkey vin to the recover tx and make sure that is there


[26-Mar-19 02:39 AM] jl777c#5810
how is this impossible to fix??


[26-Mar-19 02:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
maybe it is not, but I couldnt see any simple way.


[26-Mar-19 02:40 AM] jl777c#5810
and where is it bypassing all the checks, in the validation 'U' case it sure seems to go through all the validation steps


[26-Mar-19 02:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
line 277 returns true before everything is checked


[26-Mar-19 02:42 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so add check for minseconds and vin signed by destination pubkey


[26-Mar-19 02:42 AM] jl777c#5810
wouldnt that work>


[26-Mar-19 02:42 AM] jl777c#5810
?


[26-Mar-19 02:43 AM] jl777c#5810
if minseconds has passed and the receiver is willing to recover funds without rewards, let them


[26-Mar-19 02:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
maybe, if I can work out hwo to do that ... it seems those checks are inside rewards calc ... but there is no reward in this tx


[26-Mar-19 02:44 AM] jl777c#5810
just move the reward = RewardsCalc(amount,tx.vin[0].prevout.hash,APR,minseconds,maxseconds,mindeposit) to above the recover if statement


[26-Mar-19 02:44 AM] jl777c#5810
why wont that work?


[26-Mar-19 02:44 AM] Deleted User#0000
that would work?


[26-Mar-19 02:45 AM] jl777c#5810
amount is the principal amount in vout[0], isnt it?


[26-Mar-19 02:45 AM] Deleted User#0000
yes


[26-Mar-19 02:45 AM] jl777c#5810
RewardsCalc only needs that to calculate reward, right?


[26-Mar-19 02:45 AM] jl777c#5810
but you dont even need to know the reward, you just need to know minseconds


[26-Mar-19 02:46 AM] jl777c#5810
which is part of the plan, which is known


[26-Mar-19 02:46 AM] jl777c#5810
confused by your confusion


[26-Mar-19 02:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
yes ... but what is minseconds calcuated from, CCduration of each vin I guess?


[26-Mar-19 02:47 AM] jl777c#5810
minseconds is baked into the rewards plan on plan creation? at least that is what i remember, but it was a long time ago i wrote it


[26-Mar-19 02:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
I mean what I need to compare minseconds to


[26-Mar-19 02:47 AM] jl777c#5810
minseconds is already set!


[26-Mar-19 02:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
minseconds is there yes ... but what is it that compares to...


[26-Mar-19 02:47 AM] jl777c#5810
elapsed time is returned by CCduration()


[26-Mar-19 02:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
against what tx?


[26-Mar-19 02:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
each vin?


[26-Mar-19 02:48 AM] jl777c#5810
yes and if the youngest vin is old enough, then it is fine


[26-Mar-19 02:48 AM] jl777c#5810
all vins must be minseconds old


[26-Mar-19 02:49 AM] jl777c#5810
there also needs to be a normal vin signed by the destination, this fixes alrights "dos" attack


[26-Mar-19 02:49 AM] jl777c#5810
and recover is needed, even if it is nearly impossible to implement


[26-Mar-19 02:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
yes I understand that part, you dont want any one releaseing funds without rewards apart from the person who locked them


[26-Mar-19 02:49 AM] jl777c#5810
otherwise, if the plan funds every run out, all funds get locked


[26-Mar-19 02:50 AM] jl777c#5810
and even, the point of view that if you want to unlock all your coins without any reward, maybe it is possible at anytime


[26-Mar-19 02:50 AM] jl777c#5810
if the minseconds check is impossible to do


[26-Mar-19 02:51 AM] Deleted User#0000
I guess if you just want them back with no reward and nobody else can do it it may be ok to just ignore minseconds


[26-Mar-19 02:51 AM] jl777c#5810
i can go either way on it.


[26-Mar-19 02:51 AM] Deleted User#0000
Do we know if the globabl txfee fix works yet ? I assume its ok, but had no way to test it


[26-Mar-19 02:51 AM] jl777c#5810
it should work


[26-Mar-19 02:52 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems "Seems rewards would need a major redesign to fix this problem." was not correct then as just adding a normal vin and validating it is there is just adding a missing validation


[26-Mar-19 02:52 AM] jl777c#5810
so please before making such alarmist statements, make sure you are correct, or you become the one that cries wolf

[26-Mar-19 02:54 AM] jl777c#5810
CC have total control over the inputs and outputs. and arbitrary C code that validates, it is extremely unlikely that even a gross design flaw cannot be fixed and most things are just missing validations. now without the normal vin, it would indeed be impossible, but we are allowed to modify the tx in question


[26-Mar-19 02:54 AM] jl777c#5810
CC is still new to you and I remember at first, I had those moments too, when I thought it just wont work in a CC


[26-Mar-19 02:54 AM] jl777c#5810
but so far, always, there has been a solution, to the point where entire rogue gameplay is fed into validation


[26-Mar-19 02:55 AM] jl777c#5810
and i am also fiddling with realtime user events that will go into the validation, so over time I went from not really understanding what CC can do, to where I am now, where my assumption is that CC can do it, just a matter to figure out how


[26-Mar-19 02:58 AM] jl777c#5810
once I started thinking of validation as "what do I need to add to the tx in order to be able to validate efficiently" things became easier. dont view the tx as unchangeable


[26-Mar-19 02:59 AM] jl777c#5810
like when we found we needed the txidpk in the payments CC validation, it wasnt there and there was no opreturn... so we just make a new vout with txidpk in it


[26-Mar-19 02:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think I thaught becuse it was such an old CC we cant change these thigns as it would hard fork it... if that is not the case then its not such a problem. I will try and fix it


[26-Mar-19 02:59 AM] jl777c#5810
the rpc generated tx have two masters, the actual functionality and the validation


[26-Mar-19 02:59 AM] jl777c#5810
avoiding hardfork is nice too, but I am not aware of any mainnet usage of rewards CC yet

[26-Mar-19 03:00 AM] jl777c#5810
my guess is if you add the vin validation, all the current chains will sync


[26-Mar-19 03:00 AM] jl777c#5810
unless alright messed with something other than test chains


[26-Mar-19 03:01 AM] Alright#0419
is mindeposit check on recover mode not possible?


[26-Mar-19 03:02 AM] Alright#0419
It kind of defeats the purpose of locking coins in the first place if you can unlock them whenever


[26-Mar-19 03:02 AM] Deleted User#0000
doesnt seem easy no ... but as long as its being unlocked by the person who locked it then that doesnt really amtter does it? as they dont get any rewards


[26-Mar-19 03:02 AM] Alright#0419
the reward is from locking coins, if you can unlock them at any time, what is the risk in locking them?


[26-Mar-19 03:03 AM] Alright#0419
I see this as "having faith" in the project, you get some rewards. Show that you won't dump your coins for the next n days and you're rewarded


[26-Mar-19 03:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
you can withdraw coins from a master node ata any time.  was this not to emulate a masternode?


[26-Mar-19 03:03 AM] Alright#0419
MNs has steady payouts though


[26-Mar-19 03:03 AM] Alright#0419
idk, it just seems weird that you can unlock coins prior to their minimum unlock date


[26-Mar-19 03:04 AM] Alright#0419
there is no risk in locking coins, I thought that was the whole point


[26-Mar-19 03:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
I agree, but it seems extremly difficult to prevent while still having the recover possible


[26-Mar-19 03:04 AM] Alright#0419
What makes a normal unlock different?


[26-Mar-19 03:04 AM] Alright#0419
in that you can check min deposit time


[26-Mar-19 03:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
maybe it is possible ... will ppl actaulyl use this though it could take me a while to work that out...


[26-Mar-19 03:05 AM] Deleted User#0000
also need to figure out how its checking it... as going gettransactions on every bin then CCduration seems inefficiant


[26-Mar-19 03:05 AM] Deleted User#0000
but maybe its already doing this


[26-Mar-19 03:05 AM] jl777c#5810
but minseconds can be honored


[26-Mar-19 03:05 AM] jl777c#5810
why not?


[26-Mar-19 03:05 AM] jl777c#5810
CCduration on all 3 vins wont take long at all


[26-Mar-19 03:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
maybe I can move rewards calc up higher safey and use a flag pointer


[26-Mar-19 03:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
if any vin does not meet return false


[26-Mar-19 03:06 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, something like that. on a scale of 1 to 10, about 3 in difficulty level to fix this cleanly


[26-Mar-19 03:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
if it is only on validation side that is required I think it will be ok


[26-Mar-19 03:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
I must have misread the RPC .. if the rpc is indeed doing this already then its pretty simple


[26-Mar-19 03:07 AM] jl777c#5810
so once locked, funds wont be able to be unlocked until minimum time


[26-Mar-19 03:07 AM] jl777c#5810
the rpc can be bypassed by evil hacker


[26-Mar-19 03:07 AM] jl777c#5810
validation needs to validate rpc created tx and not validate things that bypass the rpc


[26-Mar-19 03:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
I read it as, no avalible inputs automatically unlock with no reward ... but clearly I was wrong


[26-Mar-19 03:07 AM] jl777c#5810
unless it is still following the rules properly


[26-Mar-19 03:08 AM] jl777c#5810
well, the rpc protected against that, but the hacker could have done exactly that

{Reactions}
👍 

[26-Mar-19 03:09 AM] jl777c#5810
at validation time the availability of rewards funds could change, so it cant use that as a test


[26-Mar-19 03:09 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess we need to decide how this will be fixed and update the docs appropriately


[26-Mar-19 03:09 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think I need to workout how to actually test it, and make a test chain and just mess with it...


[26-Mar-19 03:09 AM] jl777c#5810
it was a very annoying bug as a blocknotify script could have scanned each lock as they are made and instantly unlock it


[26-Mar-19 03:10 AM] jl777c#5810
no reason anybody would do that, but once made it would always be there, so this cant be ignored


[26-Mar-19 03:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
I dont think it will be that hard to fix but I struggle without being able to make prints and see what is going on


[26-Mar-19 03:10 AM] jl777c#5810
plus the evil miner sucking out all the funds with big txfee


[26-Mar-19 03:10 AM] jl777c#5810
i like printouts too

I need to work out how to test with it, after tea I will make a test chain and try and replicate the issue here


[26-Mar-19 03:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
that should help move things along faster


[26-Mar-19 03:12 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so this is under control?


[26-Mar-19 03:12 AM] jl777c#5810
what about payments CC, are there any bugs with it?


[26-Mar-19 03:12 AM] Alright#0419
easy way to test would be with PAY, invalidate block 5017 on PAY, change code to fix txfee bug, reconsider 5017


[26-Mar-19 03:12 AM] Alright#0419
should reject 5018


[26-Mar-19 03:13 AM] Alright#0419
then a couple blocks before that there is unlocks prior to minimum deposit


[26-Mar-19 03:13 AM] Alright#0419
do the same with that

evil miner txfee bug is fixed?


[26-Mar-19 03:14 AM] Deleted User#0000
the code that prevents rewards doing it should work for any CC


[26-Mar-19 03:14 AM] Deleted User#0000
it enforces the txfee cannot be larger than 10k sat on any tx


[26-Mar-19 03:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
that is provided the coins view can be relied upon... I think it can as connectblock uses it


[26-Mar-19 03:15 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, when you make pull request for rewards, you can add the payments CC fix too


[26-Mar-19 03:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
no worries, hopefully I can test the miner fee thing with what Alright said above.


[26-Mar-19 03:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
if it works there it shuld work anywhere., maybe it can be a util function for any TX.

yes, always good to make new and useful util functions

@Alright  looks fine here. are those amounts correct to you if you remeber?


[26-Mar-19 03:32 AM] Alright#0419
it was 10 locked coins, stole 1

so 0.0001 from the rewardslock txfee


[26-Mar-19 03:32 AM] Alright#0419
then 0.0001 + 1 for rewardsunlock i think


[26-Mar-19 03:32 AM] Alright#0419
I think that's correct


[26-Mar-19 03:33 AM] Alright#0419
value in was 9.9999 I think?


[26-Mar-19 03:33 AM] Alright#0419
could be wrong, just look at it


[26-Mar-19 03:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
the code is pretty simple ... going to make it into a function then. So you just pass it a pointer to a tx, and if the tx fee isnt 10ksat it juse returns false... that way works for every CC with minimal changes


[26-Mar-19 03:34 AM] Alright#0419
it doesn't need to happen on every single CC tx


[26-Mar-19 03:34 AM] Alright#0419
just CC txs that spend from global CC address


[26-Mar-19 03:34 AM] Alright#0419
not being able to set txfee might be a limitation in the future


[26-Mar-19 03:34 AM] Alright#0419
so we should do it only where we *need* to


[26-Mar-19 03:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
yeah understood... but as a function it makes it much easier to use, that is provided its correct. Its up to the person making the CC to decide if they need to enforce the fixed tx fee. I think in places it will be unavoidable to do it.


[26-Mar-19 03:42 AM] Alright#0419
it's unavoidable if tx spends from global CC address


[26-Mar-19 03:42 AM] Alright#0419
unnecessary if it doesn't


[26-Mar-19 03:42 AM] Alright#0419
can't think of any situation where it would be needed other than when spending from global CC address


[26-Mar-19 03:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
your sure on that 100%? So for payments it only needs to check this, if there is a vin from global address?


[26-Mar-19 03:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
not if itse being spent from the txidpk?


[26-Mar-19 04:00 AM] Alright#0419
if you're ever spending money that doesn't belong to you, txfee must be static 10k sats


[26-Mar-19 04:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
maybe for payments then it needs to be all the time then I think. Guess you will need to try and break it to be sure.,

[26-Mar-19 04:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
ok cool


[26-Mar-19 04:01 AM] Alright#0419
would be cool to set default mining behavior to prioritize txs that spend from global CC address


[26-Mar-19 04:02 AM] Alright#0419
not necessary right now, but we might need it in the future if a chain has full blocks


[26-Mar-19 04:02 AM] Deleted User#0000
might slow it down a fair bit as there can be a lot of those


[26-Mar-19 04:02 AM] Alright#0419
Yep, guess you want to just make more chains before you hit full blocks


[26-Mar-19 04:02 AM] Deleted User#0000
checking every single tx against that list seems like it would bog down fast, unless there was some tricky way to do it

Can you please test this? I thiunk there is still something else wrong with it. Maybe I screwed up the test of it? It appears that it will let anyone just take all the funds in the plan, provided they locked at least some.

[26-Mar-19 06:32 AM] TonyL#3577
Just checked - current unit tests for rewards not covering much.  It's only creating rewards plan, then trying to unlock it from same node and excepting error because rewards amount less than txfee.

I dont really know tbh ... There was 2 problems:


[26-Mar-19 06:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
1) miner could change tx fee and steal all the funds from global CC address, this problem is fixed.


[26-Mar-19 06:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
2) you could lock funds and then there were not enough funcding to claim the reward


[26-Mar-19 06:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
This allowed anyone to just keep on unlockign all funds, no amtter if they locked them or the minrelease had passed


[26-Mar-19 06:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
just constantly unlock as soon as funds were locked

Ah, sabotage


[26-Mar-19 06:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
I have made it so that now only if you unlock funds you locked (pubkey limited) that you can unlock and it *should* respect minrelease seconds now

  "error": "reward 0 is <= the transaction fee"
}
```


[27-Mar-19 12:33 PM] TonyL#3577
But when reward is claimable - it was done by design as I remember that anybody can unlock it


[27-Mar-19 12:34 PM] TonyL#3577
```One twist that makes it a bit unexpected is that anybody should be able to unlock the funds that were locked, as long as it ends up in the locking address. The reason for this is that SPV servers want to be supported and while locking can be done via normal sendrawtransaction, it requires a native node to do the unlocking. By allowing anybody to be able to unlock, then there can be a special node that unlocks all locked funds when they are ready. This way, from the user's point of view, they lock the funds and after it is matured, it reappears in their wallet.```

how it used minrelease wa a ccduration, for calcualting how mcuh rewards are there, and if the minrelese was not met, then it returned 0.

yes, we need to do a resync test

and maybe timestamp activate the fix


[28-Mar-19 12:34 AM] jl777c#5810
i like the idea of timestamp activating such risky consensus changes


[28-Mar-19 12:45 AM] Deleted User#0000
yes its a good idea. I used a timestamp activation for LABS notary era's seems to work ok... BUt Ithink the sapling code is safer to use than my hack of invalidating all blocks until the time from future time is past.


[28-Mar-19 12:47 AM] jl777c#5810
if the blocktimestamp is used against a future activation timestamp, that seems safe enough. the problem with sapling was that it couldnt go on and off and on again without making all sorts of problems, so I had to latch it


[28-Mar-19 12:47 AM] jl777c#5810
as long as we update the field before the fix activates, then it is not a problem

its fine ... reward calc doesnt actually look for utxos... its only checking duration


[28-Mar-19 01:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
You will need to wait until duration has passed minrelease to claim your recover

leaving PR closed as it will take at least a day for you to lock coins long enough to test it.


[28-Mar-19 01:37 AM] Alright#0419
I made a plan with 0 minrelease


[28-Mar-19 01:38 AM] Alright#0419
Can recover mode *only* work if there is not enough funding?


[28-Mar-19 01:38 AM] Alright#0419
doesn't seem to work like that


[28-Mar-19 01:52 AM] Deleted User#0000
That's how it should work... But like I've said a bunch of times its not working as its supposed to at all


[28-Mar-19 01:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
What should be happening is that if there is no funding available recover is used... But it should not let u recover or claim reward unless minrelease has passed. If there is no reward avalible then u cannot claim

I not found/reported any bug - just tried to understand what working not correct now.
Didn't know that transaction should be generated not by standart RPC call.

Hello!


[20-Apr-19 08:10 PM] Exile13#4458
if i am not the one created the cc_rewards on a specific chain, will my pubkey be able to access the `rewardsinfo`?


[20-Apr-19 08:13 PM] Exile13#4458
or am i using the wrong key probably


[20-Apr-19 08:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
rewardsinfo will show all the time as long as some -pubkey is set


[20-Apr-19 08:46 PM] Exile13#4458

[20-Apr-19 08:46 PM] Exile13#4458
oh


[20-Apr-19 08:48 PM] Exile13#4458
noob question, whats the difference between putting (.) and not having (.) in front of /komodo


[20-Apr-19 08:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
you only need a ./ if you ahvent symkinked the daemon


[20-Apr-19 08:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
generally if tesing its better not to synlink it, because you may have multiple diffrent daemons to use


[20-Apr-19 08:51 PM] TonyL#3577
. in front of /komodo means current directory


[20-Apr-19 08:52 PM] TonyL#3577
It's same as you want to copy something to current directory you have to use `cp file .`


[20-Apr-19 08:55 PM] TonyL#3577
If you can execute it without declaring path to executable - it means that it in some location which in your user PATH variable


[20-Apr-19 08:56 PM] Exile13#4458
i appreciate you


[20-Apr-19 08:56 PM] Exile13#4458
i dont understand all that honestly


[20-Apr-19 08:56 PM] TonyL#3577
For example users usually making symlink as jok3r said to some dir which is in PATH variable


[20-Apr-19 08:57 PM] Exile13#4458
will research more

[20-Apr-19 08:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
These are my own notes for the createion if THC coin. as I am making the paymetns CC that enables it to work


[20-Apr-19 08:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
We still have no concensus enforce way to pay the coinbase to the payments CC


[20-Apr-19 09:00 PM] TonyL#3577
But exile want to use rewards CC


[20-Apr-19 09:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
HE needs payments CC to pay rewards CC


[20-Apr-19 09:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
as its funded from a split of the founders reward ... mind bending stuff..


[20-Apr-19 09:00 PM] Exile13#4458
yes


[20-Apr-19 09:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
I am about to start on the coinbase solution today. But Alright went offline on me and hasnt tested something else that he reported as issue


[20-Apr-19 09:01 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh ok, I even dunno how payments CC works :)


[20-Apr-19 09:01 PM] TonyL#3577
Is it specific case or paymentsCC needed for rewardaCC permanently now?


[20-Apr-19 09:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
haha right now its pretty simple. It takes CC1of2 vout used to fund and pays defined scriptpubekys.


[20-Apr-19 09:02 PM] Exile13#4458
is this
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=TEST rewardscreatefunding test 1000 10 0 10 10`
where you created the txid


[20-Apr-19 09:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
It is only for THC coin.

Yes, then have to broadcast hex


[20-Apr-19 09:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
you can create a rewards plan, and mine the entire coinbase to iit np


[20-Apr-19 09:02 PM] TonyL#3577
And will get txid


[20-Apr-19 09:02 PM] Exile13#4458
what are those argruents at the end?


[20-Apr-19 09:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
but they wanted also a founders payment... so Payments CC was needed to sit in the middle to facilitate this

do the RPC with no argumetns


[20-Apr-19 09:03 PM] Deleted User#0000

[20-Apr-19 09:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
yes, ideally you need to figure out what the best params to use will be, as some % of the block reward is going to this plan. Dont know the specifics of what it is they wanted myself. Im just trying to get the mined coins safly to to the plan wihout letting anyone steal them along the way.

`If you create a plan with mindeposit: 10000, make sure to also add 10000 of your coin and the transaction fees using the rewardsaddfunding call after creating the plan. The rewards contract won't allow locking of funds greater than the amount already locked in a single transaction as it needs to assure that it will have the required funds to pay.

so on THC the cc_payments would fund cc_rewards


[20-Apr-19 10:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
yes, there has to be something in it. But the paymetnsCC will pay some % of the founders fee to the rewards plan.


[20-Apr-19 10:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
people can then lock their coins in the plan, and claim some of the mined coins, after the conditions have been met.

where do i find this? `fundingtxid(string) the txid of the transaction that created and funded this contract`

do i have to ues taht hex ^^

you need to send the hex with sendrawtransaction

the return of that call will give you the txid


[20-Apr-19 10:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
this txid ifentifies the rewards plan. Everything will need to use it

A lot of the newer ccs do that automatically... I guess we can add that to rewards at some pouint to make it easier to use 😃

just do rewards create again. press up key a few times and enter, then use the new hex

i think i got it, i did `decoderawtransaction` and returned `e17b29b04618b830eccdad3803963c9e89f6ba17d74a2951bf7728868f07d850`

yeah kind of, rewards doesnt send anything automatically... as it never got used for anything. We can easily add that, but you dont want to make mistakes with things if you odnt know what your doing so I think manually sending at first is better until you know how it works. 😃

stop with stop command


[21-Apr-19 02:16 AM] jl777c#5810
only if it is locked up, then try a kill -15


[21-Apr-19 02:16 AM] jl777c#5810
if that doesnt work, then likely it is stuck doing whatever and not in the part that will corrupt DB (usually), then you are forced to kill -9


[21-Apr-19 02:17 AM] jl777c#5810

Not sure loto is working or not, but I did work out how to make it very easily using future MoMoM hashes.


[30-May-19 08:01 AM] PTYX#6840
I was playing with the idea of adding a section in chameleon so that users could input 0.1 KMD and get a "ticket".  Then when the pot reaches a certain amount it does a random payout.


[30-May-19 08:01 AM] PTYX#6840
I don't know how feasible that is though at the moment with the CC. I'd like it to be KMD based.

```- Rewards
  - Insert Rewards CC proof of concept here - [link]```

Hey all, if you have any proof of concepts, or built something cool for Rewards CC, please let me know. The goal is to build out a list of concepts using CCs to help show other developers what is possible and add this to the Komodo docs page. TUIs are good and also if you have a coin using it!
