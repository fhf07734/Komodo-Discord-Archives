[17-Oct-18 09:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
next step is to get address generator done tomorrow, then begin scripting the serverside for tx parsing


[17-Oct-18 09:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
I will need people for betatesting when it s done, I will fund the coins needed for swap

[18-Oct-18 08:58 AM] Deleted User#0000
address gen script incorporated


[18-Oct-18 08:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
next step : parseTX 😃


[18-Oct-18 09:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
after the parse TX is done I think I'm mostly done in terms of automation logic


[18-Oct-18 09:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
will try to code it tonight


[18-Oct-18 09:01 AM] Deleted User#0000
maybe, If I manage to get it working tonight, that we'll have an alpha very sooner than predicted 🤞


[18-Oct-18 09:01 AM] Deleted User#0000
address gen script is standalone and already configured to handle only its stuff depending on trade status


[18-Oct-18 09:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
damn family time... wanted to dev tx logic but it will have to wait a little 😄

when the cron for genscript will work, you ll be able to go through steps 0 to 3 with address generation

tomorrow I'll manage to code the sending back, and handle exceptions and calcellation, and wrap all this on a cronnable job then... We'll have to test 😄

[19-Oct-18 04:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
thinking about it yesterday... Another part with "without received trades" can also be coded... That will basically act like an exchange, with dedicated part. Thats absolutely not one of my goal, but the exchange mode seems possible


[19-Oct-18 04:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
people would be able to see public calls for  swaps and decide to respond to the orderbook or not


[19-Oct-18 04:40 AM] Deleted User#0000
(and thinking about a dice game, with everything in place here I think it wouldn t be very hard to handle it


[19-Oct-18 06:57 AM] FishyGuts#5085
So let’s hook up soon dwy- I have ideas I want to implement for the onboard portal sooner than later.


[19-Oct-18 07:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
opids are implemented


[19-Oct-18 07:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
now I need to cron all scripts


[19-Oct-18 07:35 AM] Deleted User#0000

[19-Oct-18 07:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
unfortunately I only have a very little vm on this for now, will need a 32G at least to support more AC


[19-Oct-18 07:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
and if I want to add eth or zcash or bitcoin, i ll need a good server


[19-Oct-18 07:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
as long as it is cli, I think any coin can be added


[19-Oct-18 07:49 AM] SHossain#0007
if you are thinking about longterm and charging fee, i would suggest to get (build) a dedicated machine. an i7-8700(k) with 32/64GB RAM and 2x1TB M.2 SSD would be quite cheap. also, the new i9-9900k is quite cool as well. wouldn't cost high like proper server


[19-Oct-18 07:50 AM] SHossain#0007
VM wouldn't be great for production environment


[19-Oct-18 08:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
yeah


[19-Oct-18 08:03 AM] Deleted User#0000

[19-Oct-18 08:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
adoption will make me invest in a good machine or not


[19-Oct-18 08:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
can t predict if people will use it


[19-Oct-18 08:05 AM] SHossain#0007

will definetly add a checkconfirm method to unload script


[19-Oct-18 10:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
good news, it all works now 😃 not automated yet, last part is to retrieve txid from opid just to put it on db and main functionality is done


[19-Oct-18 10:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
opid solved


[19-Oct-18 10:32 AM] Deleted User#0000
now I have to wrap my scripts into a allinone and retest everything


[19-Oct-18 12:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
I may need 2 or 3 users for tests in the coming day, as soon as I managed to wrap everything as all in one to get it 100% automated.

In the meantime I'll add security for trade handling, like cancelling a trade. for kmd / AC it will be easy, but for PIRATE... I think the only way to cancel a trade is to just 

1) Give a new option if the trade is a z_ to get back funds on a specific z_address
2) Give the user the priv of the buffer address


[19-Oct-18 05:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
@here it works on auto mode now


[19-Oct-18 05:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
figured out how to optim and wrap, now will code exit cases


[19-Oct-18 05:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
just tested a swap and it worked like a charm

[19-Oct-18 05:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
I m thinking about starting to migrate to higher machine, if multi tx are done with testers


[19-Oct-18 05:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
it works with KMD / ARRR


[19-Oct-18 05:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
so likely any other Assetchain will work


[19-Oct-18 05:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
@here I don't know if you guyz think I should add btc  and external coins dpowed, I believe I can even manage on mid term to add eth zcash etc...


[19-Oct-18 05:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
that s not the 1st goal, but it can and may help


[19-Oct-18 07:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
just added KMDICE


[19-Oct-18 07:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
am trying a full auto swap


[19-Oct-18 07:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
it works with KMDICE : check for auto with user : opop


[19-Oct-18 07:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
I ll let it run overnight and maybe the whole weekend


[19-Oct-18 07:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
if you want to test


[19-Oct-18 07:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
won t code this week end but will refine my "strategy" to handle cancellation, of both Z and non Z assetchains, and handling multiple sent


[19-Oct-18 07:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think I'll try to add all assetchains asap


[19-Oct-18 07:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
when it will be refined and strong enough to let people discover and try it, I'll then add external coins, focusing on a reliable way to handle it, but I definetly will


[19-Oct-18 07:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
(And btw if any of you have ideas about handling blank offers : like : I trade X $TICKER for Y $TICKER2, and make it public, so that anyone can take the deal, and make the swap happen)


[19-Oct-18 07:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
acting like a pseudo exchange, but that would let people actually bid with no need to have console/nav open


[19-Oct-18 07:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
(obviously the final infrastructure if it s used will split the server part and storing of keys)


[19-Oct-18 07:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
(I see this functionnality of : WTB directly open to public as valuable, but I may be mistaken)

[20-Oct-18 06:21 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
I understand more or less, I'm curious how it can do trades securely without counterparty risk


[20-Oct-18 06:21 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
tommorrow not sure, but monday I should be available


[20-Oct-18 06:22 AM] jl777c#5810
jawarr needs to be trusted


[20-Oct-18 06:22 AM] jl777c#5810
it is basically a central swapper


[20-Oct-18 06:47 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
even with this limitation I don't think there's anything else similar, could be a success


[20-Oct-18 07:38 AM] Deleted User#0000
The concept is : instead of going blink for private trade just use jawarrr as 3rd party to secure your trades


[20-Oct-18 07:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
Each side had its own address generated


[20-Oct-18 07:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
So if something goes wrong user is able to cancel the trade and get refunded


[20-Oct-18 07:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
"You can trade any assetchain without  risk of being scammed"


[20-Oct-18 07:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
In the future it can also allow other coins like btc verus etc...


[20-Oct-18 07:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
Basically no listing fee


[20-Oct-18 07:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
And possible to give access to kmd support team if they want


[20-Oct-18 08:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
Details about it are not fixed yet. I can either run it on my own or let 3rd party use it "officially"


[20-Oct-18 08:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
That would change the "business model" i don t intend to charge, just recover server costs. And tbh didn t think about it yet. First step is to have a reliable gui/backend


[20-Oct-18 08:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
@KomodoWorld see it as a type of changelly built for kmd ecosystem


[20-Oct-18 08:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
For private trades


[20-Oct-18 10:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
Negociated this night : i ll work on it and make it available tomorrow for tests.


[20-Oct-18 10:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
Am thinking about a totally different approach, much more smoother cause it would use parallelized routines instead of a global one.


[20-Oct-18 10:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
Bt w I think I won t focus on cosmetic changes for now and just improve hidden stuff ^^

[20-Oct-18 03:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
rereding your messages, I think the I want to trade applies better on this case : you end up on jawarrr because you agreed on any otc on any forum, and you will give this amount to get whatever you require


[20-Oct-18 03:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
if there is an orderlist, it will be on a different part of the website


[20-Oct-18 03:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
All I have to add for this is a step : I want to put this offer on orderbook instead of private trade

{Reactions}
👌 

[20-Oct-18 07:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
ok, some news about cancellation of orders, 

Whatever the state of the trade, as long as the funds are not received on generated addresses, users can ask for a REFUND.

The logic is : 

Whoever asked for the cancel of order is handled, receiver, or sender, depending of the originator, the status move won t go by the same path : 

Status codes : 
//0 : new trade
//1 : sender confirmed the trade
//2 : receiver confirmed the trade
//3 : both confirmed, waiting for funding from both side
//4 : sender funding tx received
//5 : receiver funding tx received
//6 : both funding tx received
//7 : Swap done sender side
//8 : Swap done receiver side
//10 : Swap Complete !
//21 : Sender Cancelled
//22 : Receiver Cancelled
//25 : Sender cancelled, and both were refunded
//26 : Receiver cancelled, and both are refunded
//27 : Sender cancelled, sender refunded
//28 : Receiver cancelled, sender refunded
//29 : Sender cancelled, receiver refunded
//30 : Receiver cancelled, receiver refunded


Basically, when a trade is cancelled, the scripts will check during a finite amount of time that any other part didn t send in the meantime. If that's the case, the tx and amount received during the cancellation will be used to refund on a refund address (with specific dialog box when cancelling the trade). When this time is passed (maybe 2 days to begin), or whenever the side not refunded clicks as : it s ok, the trade isn t fetched anymore.


[20-Oct-18 07:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
The amount of refund will be correlated to the amount received, this will have multiple advantages : If a sender wants to send via multiple tx, that will be possible, the agreeing about the deal will only happen when amounts are matched. A security is done that will ONLY send the amount if it matches exactly the trade, in the case it isn t the case, it will stay stuck until one side or other cancels it and triggers the global refunding.

Another point about that part, is the cancelling of an order will launch a modal to give the refund address. Why this : just because it s too risky to base only on originator address, as it can be multiple if the amount is gathered via multiple txes, the other point is that in case of private addresses, we can't know the originator address, and in the global scheme, the user don't need to input his refund address.  This step being optional, it will prevent people from being lost


[20-Oct-18 07:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
this specific step will need to be tested, as only the base logic is done atm.


[20-Oct-18 07:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
will continue it and implement commands, if steps are handled fine, it will be pretty fast to add "real" commands

most OTC's have fees too, so people don't really care


[22-Oct-18 09:23 AM] jorian#4555
OTC trades tend to be significant, so 1% or even 0.1% can be a lot

I need a working and tested and approved poc before thinking about that.


[22-Oct-18 10:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
Like I said earlier or maybe on pirate chan, I believe that the first step for adoption is to have something reliable and trusted. As external coins will likely be integrated like zec btc or even eth, the goal is to attract users to kmd ecosystem and give a solution for easy and secure private trades


[22-Oct-18 10:05 AM] Deleted User#0000
In my case for example I mine eth and some other coins. That is a pain to swap... so basically here the goal is to say : whatever coin you have you don t have anything to do else than just send and wait to have your part ^^


[22-Oct-18 10:09 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think i have most stuff done for private trades. The orderbook gor example could replace the onboarding for PIRATE


[22-Oct-18 10:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
And no. I don t think charging assetchains is either viable or worth it. That is the advantage I want for asserchains creators to have


[22-Oct-18 10:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
External coins is another story.


[22-Oct-18 10:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
But to me it s the same for external coins adopting dpow : they trust us so this can be seen as another service we can offer em. As the cost of dpow may be increased in the future I think this type of tool should be seen as something that is bundled


[22-Oct-18 10:14 AM] Deleted User#0000
And tbh not knowing yet if it will be run by me or a 3rd party or officially by kmd team if they like it, it s too early for those  things. Tech first :D

1,000,000 trading voume = 1,000 - a fair fee for the work required to create and maintain it.... If youre talking about outside coins.

The tech is not an issue at this stage


[22-Oct-18 01:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
Not a marketmaker edition for  first version


[22-Oct-18 01:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
There is really a need for something right now I believe

jawarr isn't much complex from design point of view, it's only a few pages but need to be done right

Even the graphics used are a problem cause they are copyrighted atm so I must purchase or i even thought about contacting an arrist to have very good design

this seem the right job for him

Hell yeah :)


[22-Oct-18 02:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
In fact I built the system part to be able to separate each steps. That mrans i just have to replace the actual cli version of senddeal.sh by a version that integrates it with marketmaker and it will work the same exact way


[22-Oct-18 02:05 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I don't understand that part 😛 but whatever works is ok


[22-Oct-18 02:07 PM] Deleted User#0000

btw just passed the domain on 443 auto


[23-Oct-18 02:40 AM] Deleted User#0000
on the autocancel part atm, I'm handling the cases where the amount is not valid, where the amount is exactly the good one, where the amount is done via multiple tx, for example if the user just sends twice, each time the ordercancel is triggered, if there is a tx to refund, it will increase the sum refunded

If we have the case for example of a user sending double tx, and the 1st is validated and processed for a refund while the  2nd is still not confirmed, the parser will see it and see that a refund of the first part have already been sent, so the next time it will launch a refund, it will deduct the first refund tx


[23-Oct-18 02:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
that allows to be able to claim a refund even if the trade was done good


[23-Oct-18 02:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
but a user just decides to send again, he will be able to claim the not needed tx


[23-Oct-18 02:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
that will ensure no funds stay for infinite time, and the user can claim his generated address balance


[23-Oct-18 04:45 AM] Deleted User#0000
ok, that part works for now


[23-Oct-18 04:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
even if the UI changes, I ll integrate the logic on the existing webpage, that will allow me to test it directly via GUI


[23-Oct-18 04:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
the same rule applies on the other side : a user that has been refunded can just say : Ok, refund is done, stop trying to find hypothetical funds, when both have either been refunded or in case of no refund (for the side that didn't send anything).

 The refund logic stops when those conditions apply : trade done // one side refunded the other side said he won t need a refund // both refunded // in case one side is refunded and the other just let the trade die, the refunding search only lasts 2 days


[23-Oct-18 07:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
most of cancellation logic implemented, I ll start testing it, if there are volunteers... feel free to contact me !

mouseover should show a window that prompts you to give your addresses

1st address is the one you want to receive coins


[23-Oct-18 08:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
2nd is the failsafe one, in case someone cancels


[23-Oct-18 08:05 AM] Deleted User#0000
as we re on ARRR, you should input a T and a Z

you need 2 fresh addresses

basically for only T it will be easier

but i guess that is OS-specific?


[23-Oct-18 08:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
thing is just in case of ARRR, as I can t know your originator address, you have to do it manually


[23-Oct-18 08:14 AM] Deleted User#0000
for KMD and AC as the sending don't require originator addy, the command is just a komodo-cli sendtoaddress

[23-Oct-18 08:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
yeah, the fee is substracted


[23-Oct-18 08:18 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
it tx fee is included in the calc, then it will end up being wallet specific


[23-Oct-18 08:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
basically sent as "" true


[23-Oct-18 08:18 AM] jorian#4555
i see


[23-Oct-18 08:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
changed the amount during the process cause I typed a number too high ^^


[23-Oct-18 08:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
if you got 5 minutes


[23-Oct-18 08:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
we can test with KMD / KMDICE


[23-Oct-18 08:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
@ComputerGenie ?


[23-Oct-18 08:22 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
k, lemme finish making ☕ and see what my addys are


[23-Oct-18 08:22 AM] Deleted User#0000
😃


[23-Oct-18 08:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
btw those are very very small amounts so the fee is most of the trade


[23-Oct-18 08:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
seems I had 0.0001004 as fee for pirate


[23-Oct-18 08:26 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
KMDICE doesn't work in Ocean 😭


[23-Oct-18 08:26 AM] Deleted User#0000

[23-Oct-18 08:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
I ll send the dice then


[23-Oct-18 08:27 AM] Deleted User#0000

[23-Oct-18 08:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
yeah


[23-Oct-18 08:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
just type an username


[23-Oct-18 08:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
the mouseout will make it come back enabled ^^


[23-Oct-18 08:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
sent the trade to user : computergenie


[23-Oct-18 08:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
do you see it ?


[23-Oct-18 08:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
you should be in blue


[23-Oct-18 08:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
UI will be refined afterwards ^^


[23-Oct-18 08:31 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
k, see it now (no 🐫 )


[23-Oct-18 08:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
ok


[23-Oct-18 08:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
i ll valid my part then


[23-Oct-18 08:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
you have action buttons


[23-Oct-18 08:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
on the right


[23-Oct-18 08:32 AM] Deleted User#0000
that will open a window to input the addresses you want to receive your part of the trade on


[23-Oct-18 08:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
@jorian  thanks !


[23-Oct-18 08:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
@ComputerGenie your addresses were detected


[23-Oct-18 08:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
you can refresh


[23-Oct-18 08:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
it will give you the command to send


[23-Oct-18 08:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
my part is sent


[23-Oct-18 08:34 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
didn't need to refresh, but the whole mouse thing needs help


[23-Oct-18 08:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
yeah I handle most of the stuff via js atm, hopefully a UI/UX pro will reshape it

[23-Oct-18 08:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
alright


[23-Oct-18 08:36 AM] Deleted User#0000

[23-Oct-18 08:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
sending is done


[23-Oct-18 08:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
step 10


[23-Oct-18 08:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
click on the eye you should see the trade


[23-Oct-18 08:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
every side


[23-Oct-18 08:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
😃


[23-Oct-18 08:37 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
it's a little glitchy as far as UX, but works pretty well 👍🏼


[23-Oct-18 08:38 AM] Deleted User#0000
hehe


[23-Oct-18 08:38 AM] Deleted User#0000
in the future i ll add open orders


[23-Oct-18 08:38 AM] Deleted User#0000
public ones


[23-Oct-18 08:38 AM] Deleted User#0000
the receiver will just have to catch the trade he wants


[23-Oct-18 08:38 AM] Deleted User#0000
basically you ll be able to handle your WTS WTB directly on it


[23-Oct-18 08:38 AM] Deleted User#0000
not relying on chat spamming 😄


[23-Oct-18 08:39 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
but chat spamming is fun :abusedsmily:


[23-Oct-18 08:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
yeah 😄


[23-Oct-18 08:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
but scams are not :p


[23-Oct-18 08:39 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
true


[23-Oct-18 08:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
I worked mostly on the cancel order routine today


[23-Oct-18 08:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
basically the amount doen not match : the order is stuck


[23-Oct-18 08:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
then if one side cancels


[23-Oct-18 08:40 AM] Deleted User#0000
funds are sent back to refund addresses


[23-Oct-18 08:40 AM] Deleted User#0000
if the amount is done via multi tx, it handles it too


[23-Oct-18 08:40 AM] Deleted User#0000
and if you mistakenly sent twice


[23-Oct-18 08:40 AM] Deleted User#0000
the cancellation job stop after 2 days or when you say : Ok i ve been refunded


[23-Oct-18 08:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
the global time of 1 full routine is approx 50 sec, I ll parallelize it, afterwards ^^


[23-Oct-18 08:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
will reduce to approx 10 sec


[23-Oct-18 08:42 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
The key to remember is that once you get it where you think it should be, then step back and run through it as if you've never seen/used it before 
That usually helps towards making it something that folks are likely to use (imo, BarterDEX and HyperDEX lack of use has as much to do with UX as it does liquidity issues)


[23-Oct-18 08:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
yeah


[23-Oct-18 08:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think the UI/UX here is important


[23-Oct-18 08:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
but people that looked at it were lost, so I basically added tons of JS to allow only inputs where I want em to be


[23-Oct-18 08:43 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
but as far as working flow, I think you've got it good 👍🏼


[23-Oct-18 08:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
that s the primary goal atm


[23-Oct-18 08:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
thanks for your time, and the 0.99995 kmd 😄


[23-Oct-18 08:44 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
lol I think I can spare 1 KMD w/out "breaking the bank" :trollface:


[23-Oct-18 08:44 AM] Deleted User#0000
😄


[23-Oct-18 08:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
i ll let it running, cancellation tasks are not launched, I think I need to check every single case, like multisent, cancellation before a block happened. The logic stating that the sending of the shares takes into account the DB : uses the trade values. But in case of emergency, even if the trade is done, just with a flag to 1 you can ask to be refunded automatically


[23-Oct-18 08:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
(basically I just have to add a but for "support - refund me", the scripts are ready)

Ok so basically we would provide a brand new design and working UI.


[23-Oct-18 09:25 AM] adstrakt#8509
the frontend for the app.


[23-Oct-18 09:25 AM] adstrakt#8509
right ?


[23-Oct-18 09:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah. I developped the backend. If you handle the UI i will be able to focus on serverside


[23-Oct-18 09:27 AM] adstrakt#8509
Ok great. Can you give me some basic info on the brand.


[23-Oct-18 09:27 AM] adstrakt#8509
Is this associated with pirate chain

Are you available for audio session ? English is not my native language but I think you can understand me :D


[23-Oct-18 09:29 AM] adstrakt#8509
yeah i can do that.


[23-Oct-18 09:30 AM] adstrakt#8509

Hi :)

{Reactions}
👋 

[24-Oct-18 02:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
We didn t discuss about api with @adstrakt yesterday. But it s definetly something that would transform a simple website to a gloval solution. Like integrating with chatbot


[24-Oct-18 02:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think it should be built natively. As the process only relies on queries, imo that won t be a problem


[24-Oct-18 02:38 AM] Deleted User#0000
Even if it s done aside via php. No more uglyness. But same behaviour


[24-Oct-18 02:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
As every single query is already done and the ui only basically take post/get inputs it shouldn t be a big deal


[24-Oct-18 04:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
Seems there are tools built that make it very simple to have an api as there will be node.js involved. Pretty good news :)


[24-Oct-18 04:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
I ll manage to have every single step for server stuff to run concurrently. That will make things theorically 5x faster


[24-Oct-18 04:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
And test a specific infrastructure setup for security purposes


[24-Oct-18 04:27 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
@Deleted User the 🐫 case thing made me wonder about something....
What's to stop someone from being `dwy.` on some other discord server, trading as `dwy` on jawarrr (using your previous trades as "see you can trust me"), ripping people off, and creating a "bad reputation" for `dwy`?


[24-Oct-18 04:28 AM] Deleted User#0000
Nothing. That s the reason people can choose to change their name on each trade. And btw if someone impersonates me and sends nothing the other trader will just have to cancel to get a refund


[24-Oct-18 04:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
(That is the next big step : introduce the cancellation logic)


[24-Oct-18 04:31 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`the other trader will just have to cancel to get a refund`
Well that's the part that I'm thinking of....
One could tell a confused person to "be sure to put my address in the 'return to' box" and if the unsuspecting person does so, then the bad guy get the refund


[24-Oct-18 04:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think it already works as I want. But so many cases to test I didn t try all of em yet.


[24-Oct-18 04:32 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
Was thinking perhaps a `Make sure these addresses are yours` kind of "alert"........?


[24-Oct-18 04:32 AM] Deleted User#0000
Network issues here on the train


[24-Oct-18 04:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah. That will be the main focus : dst / refund are what matters


[24-Oct-18 04:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah that s why the ui is very important. Your idza is exactly the same as asking people to give you their credit card number ^^

{Reactions}
👍🏼 

[24-Oct-18 04:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
Like I told to @adstrakt the purpose is to get something as easy as a game.


[24-Oct-18 04:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
Intuitive may be the appropriate word


[24-Oct-18 04:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
Btw the dest and refund address can be the same. It s just in case of different address format that it is needed to have both


[24-Oct-18 04:36 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
just something I thought of last night when I was telling a buddy about people getting scammed with n00b using console and telling them to paste the results of `dumprivkey`


[24-Oct-18 04:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
Does this really exist ? Lol


[24-Oct-18 04:38 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
less so now, but in the early days there were many that got screwed by having issues, going to random places for advice, and getting "help" from an attacker/"bad actor"


[24-Oct-18 04:38 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah :s. Btw I believe once it s ready it will need a marketing campain and video tutorials and howto

now just need someone to do it 😛


[24-Oct-18 04:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
Tbh I even wanted to record a trade with current state to make people use actual version


[24-Oct-18 04:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
Cause the need is already here


[24-Oct-18 04:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
And once the cancellation job is integrated and all others parallelized and infrastructure secure, it can be unleashed waiting for final version. But this can have drawbacks : present something in dev and unfinished even if it works can make people just say that ui is not very good and propagate the bad reputation. So...


[24-Oct-18 04:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think the first versions should be used by insiders or testers first.

The trick is that handling username instead of addresses forces the input of the address by each side.

And it allows each side to trade without knowing the real address of the other side before the trade completes


[24-Oct-18 04:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
An option will be available for both sides that will allow em to use z or t on demand just with a checkbox


[24-Oct-18 04:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
As pirate is already supported it s just a boolean that will either generate a z address or a t address


[24-Oct-18 04:57 AM] Deleted User#0000
(Btw we will also need an embedded address checker)


[24-Oct-18 04:59 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
check is a solid idea 👍🏼  dunno why I didn't think of that


[24-Oct-18 05:01 AM] Deleted User#0000
I know decker have some scripts but as I didn t know what final language would be used I just put that part aside


[24-Oct-18 05:57 AM] Deleted User#0000
About coins integrated. I ll explore and test geth in the coming days to be able to mimic the actual path used for kmd and btc forks.


[24-Oct-18 05:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
Total discovery here but as long as am able to check status of tx, get the balance, and send tx it should be okay.


[24-Oct-18 06:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
Wrapping everything on a memo. I ll put this as sticky and will report status for each "lego block" that will form the final app. This will also allow for more suggestions and ideas that were not anticipated yet.


[24-Oct-18 07:31 AM] adstrakt#8509
A question i ask myself is. If this would not work better with autogenerated names / address - so just as you load the page you are already assigned a name. Skips one step +  could solve people using duplicate names.


[24-Oct-18 07:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
That is possible also yeah. But the user must also be able to input the name of his choice. If it acts like : default : generated but still selectable / editable it s also good. 
What it will allow is just "trade user name" creation. As temp addresses are generated on the fly once both side agreed on a trade


[24-Oct-18 07:44 AM] Deleted User#0000
Cause people loading the page could also think : hmmmm what guarantees me that I got an unique address


[24-Oct-18 07:45 AM] Deleted User#0000
Another path could be to directly generate it and have a type of choice on first screen : generate my trading pair ID, or use mine with an inputbox


[24-Oct-18 07:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
The same applies for the validation stuff : steps 1 2 3. We can change the behaviour to skip these steps


[24-Oct-18 07:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
The thing is they allow to be able to call the address gen right after we re sure both agreed on the trade


[24-Oct-18 07:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
But it can be changed to be launched just after the receiver gives his addresses


[24-Oct-18 07:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
It would remove 2 extra steps


[24-Oct-18 07:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
So the trade remains "unconfirmed" until the receiver gives his addresses. And on that state it also allows us to delete unanswered asks for trades older than x days/minutes


[24-Oct-18 07:57 AM] Deleted User#0000
You basically go from step 0 to 3


[24-Oct-18 07:57 AM] Deleted User#0000
(On current version)


[24-Oct-18 07:58 AM] Deleted User#0000
That is more user friendly as this logic will prevent one step on each side.


[24-Oct-18 07:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
I don t know how you intend to build that part but it could also mean that only one side has to type anything. The other could just use a link with his generated username inside


[24-Oct-18 08:01 AM] Deleted User#0000
Or basically the creator of the trade fills every info like source amount / coin and  dest amount / coin and the receiver only have to check that it matches when he launches the page


[24-Oct-18 08:02 AM] Deleted User#0000
That would make the autogen very cool as no noone has to enter anything else than trade details and own addresses


[24-Oct-18 08:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
The best way maybe is to just draw on paper a clean flowchart and brainstorm it here


[24-Oct-18 08:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
As long as we have a clear trade status, like state 3 : both have validated. Step 4 : address gen ok, step 5 : sender tx ok etc... it won t be a big change on queries and such


[24-Oct-18 08:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
I figured out rethinking about parallelization that half steps are a problem. For example step 3 atm is when both agreed and addresses are not generated. So the scripts that will handle have to query unnecessary columns. Splitting into 2 clear steps would make the inside work more fluid and focused on specific steps instead of flood of if... if...


[24-Oct-18 08:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
Basically each step could be associated and launched in the same time than others. As there won t be overlapping in queries and scripts


[24-Oct-18 08:14 AM] Deleted User#0000
(I planned to add extra step when address are generated, that would let me run concurrent address gen and tx check without any possible glitch.


[24-Oct-18 08:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Deleted User i, for some reason, like writing validation code. Which language do you want/need to validate addresses?


[24-Oct-18 08:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
I assume you want to do a strict check for a type of address that is valid on the particular chain


[24-Oct-18 08:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Deleted User i also like the idea that the website will give you are randomly generated name (I really like how Github gives you funny suggestions for a new repo)


[24-Oct-18 08:27 AM] dukeleto#7326
if you allow custom names, some people will choose very poor ones like BobCSmith1970 that give out too much metadata


[24-Oct-18 08:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think the validation part should be done on js. The best answer will come from @adstrakt as he is the webdesigner that will handle the frontend.


[24-Oct-18 08:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
But what is simpler than a js to include in already built code ^^. Imagining it is called just using id or class means it can work everywhere independently


[24-Oct-18 08:50 AM] dukeleto#7326
i have address validation code in JS in hush-ng/TreasureChest codebases


[24-Oct-18 08:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
Recent messages makes me feel that we really need a clear flow with identified and predictable status types. That would mean any day we want to switch to another method / language, changing a part won t break the whole tool


[24-Oct-18 08:51 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's too strict and needs to learn about Sapling addresses, I think, but it's something to use


[24-Oct-18 08:51 AM] dukeleto#7326
i also have some validation code in Perl which at least makes it easier to translate regexes to JS and know which sizes to check for/etc


[24-Oct-18 08:52 AM] Deleted User#0000
Why not. Tbh we didn t discuss such details yet with the webdesign team but this is one of mandatory "part" that we won t be able to skip


[24-Oct-18 08:52 AM] dukeleto#7326
what about an API endpoint which returns true/false for a valid address? the rest of the code just asks that endpoint


[24-Oct-18 08:52 AM] Deleted User#0000
My english is not very very good when it comes to talking (even typing makes me ashamed of myself sometimes)


[24-Oct-18 08:53 AM] dukeleto#7326
your english seems fine


[24-Oct-18 08:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
That s exactly what could solve the "problem"


[24-Oct-18 08:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
And that way of build means we can just adapt to any included coin


[24-Oct-18 08:54 AM] dukeleto#7326
my API would take an address and currency symbol and return true/valid if that address is valid on that chain


[24-Oct-18 08:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
That s amazing


[24-Oct-18 08:54 AM] dukeleto#7326
mainnet is assumed, but for testing we could also allow optional mainnet/testnet/etc parameter, networkID


[24-Oct-18 08:55 AM] dukeleto#7326
for instance, a valid t1... address is not valid on KMD mainnet


[24-Oct-18 08:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
But would it be able to check let s say emc2 / zcash / btc / eth / snowgem (took em out of my imagination)


[24-Oct-18 08:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
these are things i run into with HushList and also gui wallet code that supports multiple coins


[24-Oct-18 08:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
sure, we could support any coin, just need to have the regexes for each coin 😃


[24-Oct-18 08:57 AM] Deleted User#0000
Hehe. So... basically I feared that I had to code it myself. Seems like a divine intervention ^^


[24-Oct-18 08:57 AM] dukeleto#7326
i have some of this code written, from my hushlist and hush-ng code that supports multiple coins


[24-Oct-18 08:58 AM] dukeleto#7326
do you care what language the API is written in? What if it's a "microservice" and a little app, where all it does is validate addresses + chains?


[24-Oct-18 08:58 AM] dukeleto#7326
it needs to run locally on each jawarrr server, to be trusted. But it could be it's own little app


[24-Oct-18 08:59 AM] dukeleto#7326
i wouldn't trust a remote server to validate addresses for my jawarrr server, for instance


[24-Oct-18 08:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think @adstrakt will use node.js, so the limitation will be on their side


[24-Oct-18 08:59 AM] dukeleto#7326

[24-Oct-18 08:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
But yeah run it locally on the webserver

[24-Oct-18 09:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
Tbh I have an idea for a secure infrastructure scheme, and I think we ll manage to run the minimal things on the  public side.


[24-Oct-18 09:00 AM] dukeleto#7326
if I have a simple one-file script that spins up an embedded webserver and answers requests on localhost, it can be integrated easily


[24-Oct-18 09:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
But for example if it runs as standalone on a vps it could be even more secure


[24-Oct-18 09:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah


[24-Oct-18 09:01 AM] dukeleto#7326
i assume something like nginx or something is routing requests from the big bad internet


[24-Oct-18 09:01 AM] dukeleto#7326
and we can route to a specific localhost port for a certain file path


[24-Oct-18 09:01 AM] dukeleto#7326
i am a big fan of nginx


[24-Oct-18 09:02 AM] Deleted User#0000
Hehe. Oldschool apache here. Only used nginx for rtorrents microprojects back in the day ^^


[24-Oct-18 09:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
putting nginx in front of apache will give orders of magnitude improvements in some areas

Btw I will assume that this problem is not a problem anymore if you re confident about it


[24-Oct-18 09:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
apache holds onto database connections forever, because they are so slow to start and stop


[24-Oct-18 09:03 AM] dukeleto#7326

i worked at a link shortening company, our apache mysql DB connection count would hover at 700


[24-Oct-18 09:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
and then traffic spikes would make our DB connections go insane and bring down the system


[24-Oct-18 09:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
moving nginx in front of the apache mod_perls, our db connection count went down to 40


[24-Oct-18 09:05 AM] Deleted User#0000
And btw about stability of the app. I think i ll just use a custom version of lazynode to handle coins. So that in case a coin daemon is down it is detected and the json used to select available coins will autorefresh


[24-Oct-18 09:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
because nginx is so fucking fast


[24-Oct-18 09:06 AM] dukeleto#7326

the simplest thing is to serve all static with nginx, proxy everything else to apache. you will get a huge perf boost, will be able to use smaller servers/etc

I m with my wife atm..will be here tomorrow and friday (the whole day for both). My next step has been readjusted. I feel we would be far more productive and efficient if we put the flow chart on the paper and describe extensively what happens at each step. That will be profitable to any 3rd party that would like to join just because it will explain how to integrate in the different applications : web is one, bot is another. Once this is done (i won t lose time to get things graphically attractive, the purpose is only to be able to have a clear view on how things work and what path the users shall follow depending on each status of the trade)


[24-Oct-18 01:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
Once it s done i ll just resume my work on the ways I have to make every single step standalone and runnable concurrently)


[24-Oct-18 04:00 PM] Deleted User#0000

[24-Oct-18 08:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
didn't think about a specific interface for a potential support team / member that would like to manage it, maybe that would be a good idea, obviously not allowing to gather any secure info, but just for example to show a page printing trades stuck by status. Some can be handled automatically, but some other, that should... never happen, would need investigation. I'm trying to reduce it to the maximum giving "exit points" in case of stuck trade, depending on the status it may involve a specific modal for whatever side needs to ask for a refund (if the trade is stuck). About a way to identify and authorize it, we'll have 2 cases : There was a problem during the sending of any side : It will be handled via cancel module, as nothing has been spent, a refund is one of the way to proceed.

Not sure if this was talked about before. But we think it would be great and simple idea to add an "Invite to OCT Trade Button" once you have initiated an order that will send out a invite link by email or social network to complete the trade.

We need first to have everything done and secure before presenting it. On its current state it works but we don t want user to be afraid by current ui.

In my case not controlling the global hash it s less profitable to have 30% of hash compared to having those 30% on the highest pool

Btw about testers. The first set will be 10 15 people. In fact people in this chat that want to betatest it. The next will be more advanced and I may have to incentivize people for it @benohanlon

Crazy thing possible is to have multiple css that could allow multiple templates based on domain names :p


[28-Oct-18 12:32 AM] adstrakt#8509
In my opinion the product / brand name should be something that resonates with its target market.  Using keywords such as barter / trade /swap etc could help people remember the product. I think Barterlly although a bit mainstreamish is a really good option. Everyone knows Changelly so people can relate to that and even place us as direct alternative/option to them. I guess mainstream is good thing here, but we could also go for something more creative / unique. I will be thinking of alternatives. But i recommend buying  Barterlly as soon as possible.

Will setup redirecting tomorrow.


[28-Oct-18 02:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
About the hidden stuff. As I said to @KomodoWorld i believe that we should try to include in native mode any specific functionnality that could be needed. Just an example : 
Imagine it is run by a company. On its current state I think it s a requirement. The company won t take risks for free. So that means they should be able to "puncture" by a specific amount / percentage. All this stuff natively included and modifiable via a specific parameter table / whatever. That could even allow special event like : today swapping is free. Or just for a coin is without fee. 

Including this type of logic seems best done during inception than afterwards.


Another thing I will include is the ability for any side to choose to do only z tx for compatible chains. Basically just a checkbox will make it very easy.

This indeed seems like a good idea but in that case it could make things harder hw side. So including a potential additional fee maybe is useful.

Maybe this stuff will never be used : i mean the fee side... but if it s handled by default... it s better ^^

Cool @Deleted User yeah, I was planning to have a beta environment and another for production. I can deploy to a free plan in zeit.co or heroku for the moment (or the starter plan in digitalocean). But usually deploying to a new provider requires some tweaks, so it would be nice to do it only once. About requirements we need a server with ssh access, where we can run nodejs and mysql. We'll need to be able to request two port numbers (for frontend and backend) and to assign domain names and paths to those ports


[29-Oct-18 09:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
in terms of hw required ?


[29-Oct-18 09:06 AM] maxijb#2198
I guess it'll depend on the traffic we expect... for the test environment we can go with very low requirements


[29-Oct-18 09:07 AM] Deleted User#0000

little news here, seems eth scanning tx / keypair gen won't be a problem at all, I think I understood the mechanics, maybe that will be harder to build the tx, but so far, it's good.

lets not delay version 1 for adding ETH, just getting KMD <-> PIRATE is all the coins needed for initial release

[29-Oct-18 12:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
tbh I expect 1 month delay for the UI


[29-Oct-18 12:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
that means as long as I'm not the limiting factor, and I have things ready on the same time, everything will be ok


[29-Oct-18 12:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
and tbh this made me realize that maybe a change in infrastructure may be needed, on a more scalable way, let me explain : 

As of today, we'll rely on 4 main components : 

UI 
Payment processor
DB
Coin Server

At this stage PP and Coin server are on the same machine, but tweaking it for any coin to be redirected to the proper server may allow this solution to scale : Imagine server A can't handle more coins : just add a new one (B) with fresh coins to add, and just a param in db allowing the main PP server to point at targetted nodes may be more efficient


[29-Oct-18 01:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
No limitation whatever coin we need to add afterwards


[29-Oct-18 01:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
Even if eth not included at start. Make it possible really easily really fast without struggling is my goal :p.


[29-Oct-18 10:50 PM] maxijb#2198
So, I've been thinking about the hardware requirements... we'll need to run 2 nodeJS processes, so that should require  2 cores, plus mysql  that will do all the heavy work, so maybe 4 cores are a reasonable setup


[29-Oct-18 10:51 PM] maxijb#2198
About memory , a nodeJS app has a limit of 1.8gb of ram, that times 2 is 3.6 gb, plus mysql... I think we could be ok with 4GB of ram to start


[29-Oct-18 10:55 PM] maxijb#2198
Disk space, the biggest chunk  will be ocupied by the database... how much can that grow depends on how much traffic we'll get... let's say we start with 2GB?  Plus a 100 or 200mb of logs... then the source code will not take much space... probably 8 GB will be more than enough


[29-Oct-18 10:57 PM] maxijb#2198
Of course, the test environment will require much less equipment, probably we can live with 2 cores, 2gb memory, 2gb space


[29-Oct-18 11:00 PM] maxijb#2198
And the way that nodejs applications scale -as they are single threaded- is by adding more instances, so let's say than one node can handle 10k concurrent users (this is a benchmark that I saw online but we'll need to measure it on our app to have a clear picture), we should monitor our cpu usage and whenever that's consistently high, we could add more cores, and run more instances on those new CPUs


[29-Oct-18 11:03 PM] maxijb#2198
That's a conservative estimation I can make a priori, we'll know better once we start serving requests of course... not sure how easy it is to scale hardware in your infrastructure?

just finished the rewriting of the addressgen part. It now will take information for each coin on different servers, this will be done via a params table that will know which user/host the command need to execute remotely the requests, for some this will be done via RPC(mostly eth)
This will allow to add any number of coin as it is now possible to spread them across multiple servers.

next step is to rewrite the other parts, next will be the txsearch one, used in multiple status, so will have to be done to be able to query it via specific args


[30-Oct-18 05:05 AM] Deleted User#0000
as my main goal is to be able to run every single script concurrently on different status types of trades, I need to make sure nothing can overlap, new splitting (on latest document posted here) will allow this as every single query will be run on the same time.

very little for the webserver, db, and even coins processor... only the coins servers will have to be quite strong, but now It can be configured to poll multiple servers, I think it can be very cost effective

Cool @adstrakt. Most important is that you and @Meyse think of the UX. & customer journey /flow. and the right templates  Colours and branding  can best be made easy applicable, as you are probably do already.  That way we can decide on exact branding(s) later.

The main logic will be implemented on the PP server. Obviously the ui of all the differents possibilities to interact with the api will use this base as a standard one. That will allow easy integration of 3rd party apps

I think the first external app (webserver excluded) that will bridge on it will be the discord swapbot if @sclear still interested


[30-Oct-18 12:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
Separating the ui logic from the PP one will make it possible to have a lot of possibilities for future development.


[30-Oct-18 12:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
(Mainly via api for security reasons, by default only the PP server will have the possibility to have a direct access to the db)


[30-Oct-18 12:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
Everything else will rely on api to get stuff done


[30-Oct-18 04:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
about handling specific case, made minor changes to status, in case of an addy gen problem, depending on the side that didn't have its address generated, there will be a different status code : 

# BOTH EMPTY : 210
# SRC MISSING : 200
# DST MISSING : 205
# BOTH OK : 3

A specific script will then loop on  200 210 and 205 to check availability on a 5 min timeframe, as soon as the coin is back, it will try only the coin that is missing. if succeed : go to status 3 (BOTH OK) and back to the main path


[30-Oct-18 04:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
as coin servers will be automated, the cron timebase will have to be greater than the autocheck/relaunch to avoid unnecessary calls

@barv & @KomodoWorld so end of today i will present the first drafts. From which we will have something to discuss and a starting point to move forward from. Maybe tomorrow we could meet up for an audio chat @Meyse and give me your feedback and ideas if it works for you. Otherwise let me know.

As the api won t be able to communicate with any coinserver, i ll make a little cronscript that will generate a json for the ui to be able to know if a coin is available for a swap or not.


[31-Oct-18 06:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
(For the ui or the swapbot it will be useful too)

Hi everyone so here is the prototype so far. Still needs fixing on some things. There are also other screens/tabs missing such as history, help, public offer list. But I'm focusing now on the flow of the main swaps which are the core of the product.


[01-Nov-18 03:25 AM] adstrakt#8509
On the prototype you will be able to leave comments also click pointers you can find it on the bottom right menu

Oh yeah forgot to say - you can click around the prototype - if you click anywhere you will see blue boxes where you can click through.


[01-Nov-18 03:28 AM] adstrakt#8509
For now two main tabs that are working  are Outgoing Swaps & Incoming Swaps. These will also have tooltips saying what they are.


[01-Nov-18 03:30 AM] adstrakt#8509
Hope you guys like it so far - my idea is that looks like an app in this box framework - the screens should animate with fade and pop effects. Also should be easy to convert to a mobile version without changing to many things. Looking forward to the feedback.

[01-Nov-18 08:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
looked at how it could be done to support ERC tokens, found a way using etherscan API for example, registered there and created an API key, very easy to get the balance. My problem now is that the contract stuff need to be done and encoded on the data fieldof eth_sendtransaction, but I don't know how to do this yet. I think it will take a bit of time for me to be able to generate this field (which will mean supporting ERC tokens). Unfortunately, every info I gathered was focused on handling tokens via GUI, not much info for curl/cli.


[01-Nov-18 08:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
As this part may be time consuming, I will just skip it until I found a way to build the data field.


[01-Nov-18 08:14 AM] Deleted User#0000
that means ETH will be supported, and ERC will be too (theorically). Even if I don't dig into it right now I think it will require a DB change for the trade table : adding src_contract and dst_contract, which will allow querying any contract just by typing the contract address

rewritten scripts will be reviewed / optimized after I ll have finished to rewrite the 2 remaining ones : senddeal.sh (when funds were received both side, this script just send each side their part), and cancelorder.sh (handling cancellation from any status, calls refund if needed)

@Deleted User I have question: how much of this is possible thanks to Komodo technology? i.e. I think it could it be done with existing tech but does Komodo tech plays an important part in developing it? Does it make a significant difference that we could say "powered by Komodo" ?  It's not clear to me how much is based on it

[01-Nov-18 03:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
The scripts are not komodo specific, they are using any coin cli to make it possible. Coins like ETH, (I really hope I'll be able to integrate it) will also be integrated. In fact any coin having a CLI could theorically be integrated, without any scaling issue as they can sit on multiple servers.

The thing is : It will make every KMD AC easier to buy/trade, and will at the same time be useful to any trader that want to be recognized as trustworthy (A reputation system is planned).

With current "tech", we can't say it's KMD "powered", but if this project is successful and people like the concept maybe in the future there will be a possibility to use different method and get rid of infrastructure, or the project may also go on a totally different way and just develop an exchange feature


[01-Nov-18 03:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
any new KMD assetchain will be exchangeable natively on the platform, this point may also help motivate devs to choose to create assetchain on KMD, or migrate their existing token into a KMD AC.


[01-Nov-18 04:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
Obviously, Barterlly alone won't be the reason people would choose to use kmd tech instead of something else, but at least it will be a brand new tool that didn't exist before.

@adstrakt maybe there will be some minor change as the privacy option, opting for a Z tx instead of a T one on compatible chains will require 2 checkboxes instead of one, instead of "I want it private", I believe each side should have : I want to pay in Z AND I want to be paid in Z checkboxes.

For the behaviour, the :"I want to pay in Z" will only be a checkbox that will activate a db flag to let scripts know they have to gen a Z, no ui work, just the checkbox.
the : "I want to be paid in Z" will have just a slight modification : src_deal must be checked accordingly, as the receiving address won't be a T anymore

[01-Nov-18 07:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
every single query should be transmitted via the API : only valid calls will be processed

the db server is even more important than coinservers

took control of the managed switch, and just made classmates server disconnect... objective complete, you have every single protection... but you can't handle this XD. They took 5 minutes to figure out I cutted every single webserver, only mine was still alive.

while I code the sending part... I just realised a little drawback of implementing fees, that will force me to rewrite most of sent commands, as I assume the amounts will be received as 1 single utxo, chaining deal / different fees will have to be done via sendmany or z_sendmany. Not a big deal, just a bit of time to spend on this.


[01-Nov-18 09:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
will just need to reverse things internally and it should be okay 😃


[01-Nov-18 09:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
I'll have to make a few tests with different blockchains btw, like eth / game etc... to see if they all have sendmany (I just realised this part may be obvious, but not to me atm :D) if that s not the case I'll just handle it differently 😃

I think I'll have to handle specific case where amount of fees is under a specific amount


[02-Nov-18 12:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
that would transform the potential fee to a fixed bottom

ok, seems all is fixed... now rewrap things and T TX are handled. I don't have much work on Z as they already use the sender info... so it will basically be adding fee "on demand" depending of the config


[02-Nov-18 12:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
passing beast commands from one server to another is really a pain, shortcutted it with local script only wayting for params and doing the calculations, will unload the PP server on the same time


[02-Nov-18 02:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think I realised a potential bottleneck for servers and coins handling z tx, currently designing stuff to get it working without issues


[02-Nov-18 04:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think the best method will be to store tx to send and group them. That way on each coinserver, properly configured, it will loop through all assets to see if there is work incoming


[02-Nov-18 04:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
Will allow better resource management than going wild sending x tx at each trade


[02-Nov-18 04:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
In case the platform is not used a lot it wouldn t be a problem but in case of even 20 trades a minute in z it can really be a pain


[02-Nov-18 04:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
Batching sends seems a way to handle it cleanly


[02-Nov-18 04:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
This will require proper configuring of each coinserver but as the final script will be able to handle both daemon and tx stuff based on a param... it will also allow to have a unique task to run on coinserver


[03-Nov-18 02:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
little update here. Will work the next 5 hours on it. Atm grouping is working, but I want a more secure way... Another "scenario" I had in mind : coinserver down... A way to fast recover is to be able to hot swap to a brand new coinserver just by changing the db


[03-Nov-18 02:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
passing the pending sending txed on a transitional state would allow to have a single script that could regenerate not already sent on demand


[03-Nov-18 02:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
Had another idea btw... but I feel it could be a bit complicated and maybe too messy for end users


[03-Nov-18 02:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
as the system will rely on a roundrobin at min level to be able to process everything smoothly, Another option is to just give users the ability to choose : instant delivery : instead of building a pendingtx  file, it would create exactly the same, but for lets s say : urgent tx, and would just shortcut the round robin


[03-Nov-18 02:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
not a lot of work to have this implemented as it would basically be a flag to redirect to urgent trades


[03-Nov-18 02:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
the construction method would be the same, only the name of the buffer would vary


[03-Nov-18 02:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
planning to get every coin included tonight for the sending part (excluding eth for the moment)


[03-Nov-18 02:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
on a proper format, with adapted statuscode for maintenance reasons


[03-Nov-18 02:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
this will be invisible to end users, as the specific state will just say : YOur tx will be processed in the next grouped sending


[03-Nov-18 02:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
the current method just stores vin and vout to spend on a specific file. When the number max of trades per tx will be met, fire the sending


[03-Nov-18 02:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
(will also have to find a smart way to handle thresholds not to block sending too much, but as Z tx are CPU intensive, I think I'll just alternate Z and T at first


[03-Nov-18 02:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
and if Z can coexist with T (at same time), I will just send T instantly, and only delay grouped Z


[03-Nov-18 02:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
I hope digitalprice.io have this method... if not they servers may burn with ARRR 😄


[03-Nov-18 08:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
little update : 

Grouping TX'es made me do a lot of db change. Manually it works (manually activating scripts), found a way to get better written script, trying to align every set of instructions to correspond for every coin (playing with var a totally new way will theorically allow me to just have a single set for btc/scash params instead of having something more specific.)


[03-Nov-18 08:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
atm : status 6 -> autocall createraw on coinserver : generates a file that will have every info needed to create raw transactions 
Then the send functions are called and based on coin param will send x amount of tx in only one.


[03-Nov-18 08:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
(will have to handle the time specific things, but I intend to deport the entire sending logic to a central management that will handle every coin and priotirize coins


[03-Nov-18 08:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
only raw scripts are being written atm, the global logic when each standalone script will be done right after that.


[03-Nov-18 08:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
In fact I just realised I could save a lot of time by trying to reduce to the maximum the cases and coins opt., with new wrapping, it will be possible


[03-Nov-18 08:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
didn't lose time on z tx... will have to find another way, as I firmly thought that selecting... best said : targetting senders would be possible, it is not the case, as the only available command is z_sendmany, and I didn't find a way to build it "raw"


[03-Nov-18 08:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
got few different approaches, will pick the most secure one. Obviously if the amount of z is low, it won't be a problem to chain em, we will only face the issue if there are tons of Z. In that case... I got Ideas I have to test.

So far queuing worked like a charm, but that's not what I intended to do. The only way to wrap em may just be to z_merge, then z_sendmany


[03-Nov-18 08:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
will get T working properly and automated before making my choice for Z.


[03-Nov-18 08:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
this sending part is taking a good amount of time, but I tried to write it having in mind I will need to reuse it for cancellation, so both will be compatible, and I think for cancellation that I will mostly have to deal with logic, instead of commands

{Reactions}
💯 

[05-Nov-18 04:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
Adding the possibility to spread commands on more that 1 server per coin. Specially for z tx.


[05-Nov-18 04:14 AM] Deleted User#0000
Unfortunately that means more refactoring and passing vars to subscript as the main can t handle it anymore now


[05-Nov-18 04:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
Will need to adapt the 2 first main scripts : addrgen and seartchtx to allow em to get multiple or randomized values for server infos


[05-Nov-18 04:15 AM] Deleted User#0000

little update here


[06-Nov-18 10:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
just finished to rewrite addressgen and searchtx to allow use of as many servers as needed, the process is fairly simple : admins wanting to add a server just add a row in the table, and then the scripts will automatically split the charge across servers


[06-Nov-18 10:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
the reason of it is clearly Z tx


[06-Nov-18 10:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
as they are resource intensive,we can imagine having like 10 servers handling Z


[06-Nov-18 10:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
scaling is also possible for T


[06-Nov-18 10:09 AM] Deleted User#0000
that means even in case of a servercrash, just a command typed on db can allow to pop up a second server with the same exact set of addresses to handle


[06-Nov-18 10:09 AM] Deleted User#0000
those options will be done afterwards, but basically, possibilities to add coins and servers are not limited anymore


[06-Nov-18 10:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
(options for hotswapping from one server to another)


[06-Nov-18 10:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
if used also for T tx, it can also be useful to improve SLA, as maintenance nodes won t hurt the system, imagine 2 servers out of 3 are down for maintenance, the 3rd still works, so the scripts will only send to alive servers


[06-Nov-18 10:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
having a maintenance will obviously freeze people hosted on the server in maintenance, but won't harm the whole process


[06-Nov-18 10:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
(and in case it s too long, a duplicate of params across servers will also be possible, not a big deal, but..... afterwards)


[06-Nov-18 10:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
my next step is to write senddeal completely clean with new options for distributing load across servers, once it will be done, the last "big" part : cancellation will be the only remaining ones.
It s pretty clear that I won't be able to handle every single glitch / case / whatever with just 4 scripts, but as I think they can be enough for 95% of the cases... It will allow us to plug the GUI to the solution, and run tests


[06-Nov-18 10:14 AM] Deleted User#0000
testing swaps here with only db activation is really a pain, but at least it validates the rules are working


[06-Nov-18 10:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
after all those scripts are done, I'll still have to automate their launch on the different servers / components, but as I rewrote em all to be parametrable, it will basically be only a chain of rules to use x or y param


[06-Nov-18 10:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
I've seen the UI, very cool @adstrakt , there will be things to move / adapt, but once we re all clear on the definitive path / statuscodes / steps, it will be good

ok, new server ordered, just finished the global process handling T TX. Figured out that with the only little checkboxes that will provide anon on demand, there is much more cases than just a : paying in Z ? ok gen a Z.
It affects how funds , via addresses, must be distributed across servers, to allow scaling for Z.
(of course mixmatch of servers are possible, a server can be eligible for Z only, or serve both and be included i the randomization process)
As it s currently designed : T stays on coinserver classic, or on any available T server, if it s a z, same : Generate the address on any avail Z server 

The only edge case is that if one side want to be paid in Z, and the other side pays in T. That would have needed an additional process, but not anymore as the server choosing catch this case and gen the T address for the dst on a Z server, allowing to direclty sending back to the src his share


[07-Nov-18 02:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
this will aboid 1 very intensive step, cause if that would have not distributed like it, even T servers could end up handling Z tx


[07-Nov-18 02:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
judging about performance and Z rate / percentage of usage, admins will be able to add servers in minutes, without disturbing the app


[07-Nov-18 02:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
now it s time for me to handle Z sending. Will start in 30 min, I rewrote the 3 main scripts so much time that I just realised I could even handle cancellations or refunding without any specific script, just passing good params to the sending one.


[07-Nov-18 02:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
for info didn t touch eth for 1 week, and after every rewrite I tested it : addressgen still works, and TX detection too...


[07-Nov-18 02:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
(it was expected, but, just to say I think I have a lot of work to come, but this is still one of my objective even being on time (end of month), talked with artem a little, seems I will need to query parity via web3 to interact with contracts, but am not (yet) afraid to test that :D)


[07-Nov-18 06:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
new intermediate status will be needed, as different sending method will be used, each one of em just having a meaning : Raw transaction created, waiting for sending, sent, waiting for confirm, etc...


[07-Nov-18 06:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
will be much more smoother than just : awaiting sending back of share


[07-Nov-18 06:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
will also help tracking status of internal operations

attacking sending script for z right now,


[08-Nov-18 08:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
T already working, will need an improvement to be able to maintain the db updates as soon as the launch of sending is completed


[08-Nov-18 08:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
first I ll just make sure Z txout are generated well, and rewrite T sending to add dbchanges


[08-Nov-18 08:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
after that ... scripts handling sending errors


[08-Nov-18 08:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
not yet sure how I'll implement it... the easiest solution would be to just retry if a createraw failed after a specific amount of time, cause the only reason would be that the server was unreacheable while generating the file to be parsed for send.


[08-Nov-18 08:51 AM] Deleted User#0000
(after all this is in place, I think I'll need to add something to automate transfer from 1 server to another, in case of a server crash, failover would just need a massive import / rescan

shutting down notarystats.com for maintenance, it only had some wallets, but with so many test I need to merge... and can't cause server is at 90% load


[08-Nov-18 01:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
will relaunch it in one hour approx... Just want the sending complete before installing the new server


[08-Nov-18 01:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
grouped send and processing of multiple trades went 90% ok, only 1 case didn't send, but it's the specific case I mentionned earlier... so  I'll fix it, and relaunch


[08-Nov-18 01:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
simulating 8 people doing 8 trades with 8x2 addresstypes to handle is fun, but as some wallets are moved on alternate servers on purpose, it slows down things like here when I can't merge 😄

i'll have to deal with maybe hundred of addresses, didn t think about a proper way of doing, I have a few ideas


[09-Nov-18 05:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
`komodo-cli clearwalletnotarisations <txid> ` deletes all txs except the one specified ... wallet.dat does not actually decrease in size ... but the listuapent call speeds up as if it did... not sure why.


[09-Nov-18 05:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
it handles all wallet address


[09-Nov-18 05:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
I didnt use -pubkey parameter for this RPC.


[09-Nov-18 05:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
just `pwalletMain->IsMine()`


[09-Nov-18 05:09 AM] Deleted User#0000
hmm


[09-Nov-18 05:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
wallet size is not a problem if listunspend and global cmd not affected


[09-Nov-18 05:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
it could be used as frequent task, and pure refresh as 1 month task


[09-Nov-18 05:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
Thats what im thinking aswell


[09-Nov-18 05:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
Its a bit slow, I used it before with 45,000 tx KMD wallet ... 25mins to import privkey and 3mins to clear wallet... But I used the filter option, rather than a force delete... which is a proper algo, to detect spent txs...


[09-Nov-18 05:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
handling it via balance instead of listunspent wouldn t speed it ?


[09-Nov-18 05:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
skipping empty addresses


[09-Nov-18 05:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
just parsing utxos for remaining wallets


[09-Nov-18 05:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
There is probably way to speed it up ...


[09-Nov-18 05:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
yeah, skip whatever you can


[09-Nov-18 05:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
the walelt is as stupid as we always thaught it was ... it stores everythig as a TX


[09-Nov-18 05:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
😄


[09-Nov-18 05:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
and you can only delete a tx


[09-Nov-18 05:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
or add it


[09-Nov-18 05:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
so if a tx is received by you, and only 1 of 1000 vouts is yours


[09-Nov-18 05:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
it stores the whole thing


[09-Nov-18 05:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
seems best way is to detect balance with unspent balance... then remove all txs with no unspent balance


[09-Nov-18 05:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
I did that with my filter algo, but only for notarisations


[09-Nov-18 05:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
likely cna be adapted to other uses though


[09-Nov-18 05:28 AM] Deleted User#0000
so you basically import only your vouts ?


[09-Nov-18 05:28 AM] Deleted User#0000
kind of


[09-Nov-18 05:28 AM] Deleted User#0000
that's awesome ^^


[09-Nov-18 05:28 AM] Deleted User#0000
1) scan the wallet for transactions where all the vouts that are yours are spent
2) scan the wallet for all transactions to the CRYPTO address (notarisations) 
3) cross check all notarisations to transactions that are totally spent
4) remove all notarisations that came from the totally spent transations
5) remove the totally spent transactions, and the previous vout


[09-Nov-18 05:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
getting rid of wallet.dat is the main objective


[09-Nov-18 05:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
ensuring having any vout recorded on alternate db would be extermely nice


[09-Nov-18 05:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think in the end, we should just move to use addressindex etc ... like james did with CC contracts


[09-Nov-18 05:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
but there then needs a new way to stor privte keys as using just the -pubkey is very limiting


[09-Nov-18 05:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
yeah, signing is the limiting thing


[09-Nov-18 05:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think in the next coming monthes I'll begin playing with MM


[09-Nov-18 05:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
ultimate goal being to get rid of infrastructure, but I believe it is targeted at very different users


[09-Nov-18 05:32 AM] Deleted User#0000
cause here we only ask for a simple sending, that can be done from any wallet


[09-Nov-18 05:32 AM] Deleted User#0000
handling or accepting privs as input is a big red warning flag here


[09-Nov-18 05:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
I know we need it to have a fully decentralized platform, but I need to hammer through everything before starting any implementation


[09-Nov-18 05:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
yes ... redesigning the wallet is a MASIVE undertaking... I have been deep in its code, and its obvious why no body has done this yet.


[09-Nov-18 05:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
that's not because noone did it that it's impossible... But that s very very hard as it could end up doing weird stuff


[09-Nov-18 05:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
ohh yeah ... its weird alright ...

[09-Nov-18 05:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
Very strange... I ran into situations, where i removed txs that came after anohter one ... and then the listunpent would say ther ewas extra utxo, but getbalance and sendtoaddress couldnt see them

iguana has all its own functions for wallet stuff... but most of them are unused


[09-Nov-18 05:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
it cna build txs and sign etc without the daemon wallet


[09-Nov-18 05:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
seems a good base to start from for a new implementation


[09-Nov-18 05:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
in the end, the wallet needs to be removed from the daemon alltogether

you can cmpile it without the wallet ... then just use a 3rd party to build and store all tx information and just use daeomon to send raw tx

Huge news here. Not directly related to barterlly... but will help : 
Just received the confirmation of HR about my planning until early january : reduced to max 2 days a week with 1 of the 2 days being done remotely. That will give me a lot more time than what I could expect. Obviously they didn t like it and hate the situation but they accepted.

Talking about wallets - it would be great to integrate Ledger Nano login to Bartelley in the future or a login to KMD browser like plugin like Metamask . To make the swaps seamless, all within the app.

About progress... hard time here. Overcrowded by requests from everywhere lol. Managed ro get the registering of a new coinserver very easy : 4 commands to launch and the new server is ready to fire

[13-Nov-18 04:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
But when the adding of coinserver will be validated I ll resume my work on the sending part : I just stopped after updating status when the raw is submitted to the serv but I want more info on userside so i ll just add some status like : raw sent waiting for sending. Sent : waiting for confirm. Sent and confirmed.

For the Z it will act the same but with more steps : raw sent waiting sending. Sent : get the opid. 
Loop until opid goes to succedd and extract the tx.


[13-Nov-18 04:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
Those won t do much stuff but will allow users to track precisely their transactions.


[13-Nov-18 04:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
After it s done (estimate 2 3 hours to get it done) i ll handle cancellation. 

Objective is to have cancellation and detailled status done for wednesday eve / thursday. 
Will then begin drawing the global PP server automation scripts. But as everything is already handled via params and well distinct status codes it won t take long. 
The last step will be to do the same on coinservers, but here again as everything uses params the only point that can take a little bit of time will be the "round robin" stuff on Z servers. 
(I believe that sending every minute for any coin for t tx will be ok)

reread the images you posted @FishyGuts , that guy definetly could get rid of CLI using our solution


[15-Nov-18 07:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
Ok... little and huge update here....

Managed to get the logic working for send part and handling exceptions. Cancel was done pretty fast thanks to the x rewrites of other stuff to handle every single case... on serverside it all is contained in 4 scripts. And 4 on CoinServers.

Automatic mode worked with manual sending (launching script) on coinservers... so now it will just be to find the smartest way to scan through coins and launch sending...

This means I m nearly ready to be plugged to the gui. Few more tests but the main first rush is behind me.

Next objectives : finish a basic version of automation on coinservers and after it works refine both automation scripts.

Futures improvements will likely be bugfix and optims(for example as every Coinserver interoperate with PPserver via SSH, reducing the calls to the max and using a different method would speed up things even more. Had an idea about it that will coincide with external tools / value I want to be available : servercoin availability and such. Grouping calls will remove most of slow stuff.
I ll also have to rewrite every single part using latest things I discovered and learned.

Next steps and improvement will require setting up a lot of trades and test again and again. That will make the pressure go down cause most code is already written

I'll definetly use it for compatible dpowed coins, as the fallback for all others coins will be automatic... thanks to how it was coded


[16-Nov-18 10:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
maybe I'll re ask (maybe for the X time, to JL the exact path the 2 vars take, but I believe if I understood it good that not considering a TX is notarized until .confirmations goes >1 is the way to leverage dpow)


[16-Nov-18 10:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
all dpowed coins will then have a minconf to 2 : Dpow is in charge, for other coins, it will be higher


[16-Nov-18 10:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
(maybe then on explorers it would be useful to have next to the confirmationbox another field : Dpowed true/false

it seems the current code either use rawconfirmations, or just isn't aware of it

My next move will to write the automation part on CoinServer, then I'll have two options : 

Refine the code, and the debug printouts
Continue adding ETH (It works for addrgen and searching TX), the sending part is not done yet.

ETH sending is not a big deal, it seems (but everything that was not intended to be a big deal ended using a lot of time with every checks added), the ERC on the other side, will require some web3 instructions, and maybe js coding. I think that's the part that will be delayed a little bit, as main objective is to have everything working to launch testphases


[16-Nov-18 12:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
but the thing is... as the global logic seems running without any issue for now (the most complicated stuff is handling Z and loadbalancing across servers), it's just adding commands to empty shells already predicted

ok, fullauto done. Managed to clean a bit more scripts for logs, and change some stuff to get rid of local files, on 8 trades... 8 trades went to the creation of raw, Z or T, on different servers. Only 1 transaction was rejected, BTC, because they deprecated the signrawtransaction, I ll have to adapt to latest signrawtransactionwithwallet... but np.

As automation and scripts improve, I'll continue testing sends, but will wait for gui for multiple and large scale ones, cause setting this up via db only is a pita

Micro update here. Started to have some stuff working yesterday using web3.py. but for an unknown reason the console broke and can t call web3 functions. Tried to debug / reinstall / change python version during all night. Seems I really did too much tests of different python version and have either to start on a fresh server or find a workaround.

As you can pop as much servers as you want and distribute the only bottleneck is the PP server

Some sort of cheating workaround would imply installing a dummy node and just continue on scripts using parity remotely...

[22-Nov-18 12:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
Emergency procedures and maybe emergency brain activated lol. Figured out a fix for python console keeping the same server. But as I went far too hard on the system part I think it will require me to reinstall fully this node before the testphases. It s the best solution I could manage to do without losing more time on system part.


[22-Nov-18 12:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
At least it will allow me to implement eth stuff if that damn console stays alive


[22-Nov-18 12:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
Incredible to see how packages there are built. Default installs wrong version and can t even launch... and each step fixing a part breaks another one


[22-Nov-18 12:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
Then you fix dependencies... but after that you end  up looping on the console crash...


[22-Nov-18 01:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
ok, with fresh console I was able to remove rpc calls frome one node to another... rewrote generating / searching tx with parity / web3.py


[22-Nov-18 02:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
works for testnet so... mainnet will just need a change in db... before attacking send part, I'll have a little conversation with parity's daemon on my node, and will check I still can getbalance with contract address as var.

If that works, it will require some sort of db "switch" I mean, it will be handled like the rest of eth and other stuff, but will rely on parity as central point for gathering data

btw, about the tech part, all this stuff made me focus on building a working solution, but I didn't focus on maintenance (I mean wallet size, every other stuff is built to be easily manageable, like distributed lazynode that can update X servers on 1 command line)


[22-Nov-18 02:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
About the wallets... after every single tests I ve done, they re still very low in size, so performance is not yet an issue


[22-Nov-18 02:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
comparing with the NN wallet, knowing exactly how much tx are done there, I think it won't be a very urgent task, at least it is very important, but even if there are more than 10000 tests on each chain, the wallets will remain under let s say 100 mb


[22-Nov-18 02:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
so that's something I'll handle after the main "building"

Ok, managed to include eth and erc at the base of addrgen and searchtx scripts, that needed some db changes, but had a call with Maxijb about that, and we may use some more tables for different purposes : admin and / or storing information. We'll manage to keep conftable as place for confs only and separate infotype tables with less important information


[22-Nov-18 08:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
ERC balance checking passing var for contract to check works, tx checking too. Unfortunately, for ERC it requires using external explorers like etherscan or ethplorer.io. This is indeed a limitation, but as I believe it is possible to extract the needed data via the parity node (but I ll need more experience on it), that will be something that will have to be done afterwards.

At first, I don't expect it to be a bottleneck, but in case of lots of trades, the api limitations will be an issue, and we won't have the choice but to develop our own solution to extract data from our servers


[22-Nov-18 08:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
(but for the beginning, it will be fine.


[22-Nov-18 08:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
Another thing about ERC, if we manage to handle em, it will be possible either to choose one or just to type the contract address user want to interact with. Some checks will be done, but at first, it will be the user s responsibility to check the contract is well written. (some parity stuff will also able to help the gui here, using functions that will return the validity of the contract or not).


[22-Nov-18 08:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
Talked a little bit with french eth devs, and it seems adopting the behaviour of btc is not possible at all, speaking about transactions ant outputs.

For example in btc/zcash, I can wrap multiple tx for T, and make a big tx that uses many inputs and outputs... For Z, exactly the same, as z_sendmany allows me to have multiple destinations even if I only provide 1 source. 
For eth, it's quite different : 1 source : 1 dest, as they told me. There are some workarounds possible like sending to a contract that will autohandle the splitting, or just multisend manually.
The problem with the manual send will be about fees.


[22-Nov-18 08:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
so I'll keep digging on this part. (it's not relevant in case of 0 fees at all, the only issue if if fees are implemented, as they will be very tiny values, is that not including em with a main transaction may end up as making em flagged as dust

Improved performance for info gathering on eth / erc. Unfortunately it s a pain to get specific data on parity without relying on external api like etherscan.

There is a way. But it would just be like developping our own API to get the specific info we need to check everything is all right. 
I think that s something that can be done afterwards as etherscan is worlwide used... but as I hate depending on external services I may even have found a guy that could code it for us on future release (even if I ll definetly try to implement it myself before cause I won t allow unknown code to be executed without checking any single character.)

I know gather perfectly the tx and any info needed on eth / for erc20. Former version took something like 4s to answer so it was definetly not possible.
Figured out a smartest way to implemenr concurrent running of scripts  that will totally eliminate any overlapping possibility.

had an extended conversation with an ETH dev that seems to be able to handle pretty much everything we should need now to get things really robust for ETH and ERC. As of today, ETH already works, but ERC20 is a pain to handle just because of this GAS issue. 
This guy has already developped an implementation of the ERC865, that fits exactly what we need to achieve to get any ERC integrated without needing to worry about those concerns. I believe he's good enough to even bridge parity / geth to allow us to have a custom API : That will allow us to theorically get rid of etherscan, or at least reduce external calls to the strict minimum.

i am actively working on address validation code


[27-Nov-18 04:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
i have a prototype working for HUSH transparent  + Sprout zaddrs (it does not have sapling yet)


[27-Nov-18 05:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c i am writing address validation code, wondering about the validity of Sprout + Sapling zaddrs on KMD + other asset chains. At what point do sprout addresses become "invalid" ? Should we assume, for purposes of this project, that only Sapling zaddrs (not sprout) should be considered "valid" ?


[27-Nov-18 05:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
also, since I hear OOT is not upgrading to Sapling, this makes our address validation code more complex


[27-Nov-18 05:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Deleted User are we supporting new bech32 btc addresses and/or considering them valid?

[27-Nov-18 06:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Deleted User what I am asking about, is that certain kinds of addresses will be deprecated soon, and become invalid at some future block height (i.e. sprout zaddrs on some chains)


[27-Nov-18 06:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
Hmm. We ll then have to handle this specifically for each coin via a flag


[27-Nov-18 06:37 PM] Deleted User#0000

@Deleted User i have just learned i need sha3 to fully validate an ETH address ( compute a checksum ), does your codebase use a library already that provides sha3 ?


[27-Nov-18 09:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
i can do basic validation, but checksum validation would be even nicer 😃


[27-Nov-18 09:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
this module implements a "valid eth address" function, which is one option: https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/web3-utils.html?highlight=isAddress#isaddress


[27-Nov-18 09:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
in theory you could validate that it's valid base58check format for BTC/ZEC/KMD addresses, but I have never ever seen that done in non-core code.

for searching / sending


[28-Nov-18 06:28 AM] Deleted User#0000
for example : on sending part : 

dst_contractaddress_hex=$(/home/${USER}/barterelly/CoinServer/ethscripts/eth_checksum ${12})


[28-Nov-18 06:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
and contents of this script :


[28-Nov-18 06:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
#!/usr/bin/env python3.6
import sys

from web3 import Web3, HTTPProvider, IPCProvider
from web3.gas_strategies.time_based import medium_gas_price_strategy

web3 = Web3(HTTPProvider('http://localhost:8545'))

print(web3.toChecksumAddress(sys.argv[1]))


[28-Nov-18 06:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
so checksum won t be a problem


[28-Nov-18 06:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
and I believe as we ll handle it in the coming weeks very differently that the checksum part will even be invisible


[28-Nov-18 06:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
only the validity "boolean" is needed on GUI


[28-Nov-18 06:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
James solution about giving specific timestamp instead of block is cool, because it won't rely on any query


[28-Nov-18 06:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
as timestamp can be generated on js with no harm


[28-Nov-18 06:32 AM] Deleted User#0000
the only thing we ll need is some sort of data for integrated coins with activation timestamps

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Little bit of spacing after my recent flood


[28-Nov-18 06:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
so, I decided last night to change how I handle sending, cause it currently requires some calls that are very slow, like executing a script on the coinserver to get status + executing remotely scripts that will generate every single bit of needed info to put the params in files to get it automatically processed independently by the coinserver


[28-Nov-18 06:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
the limitation about this is pretty simple : 

Imagine we got a version very fast of the backend that runs, let s say we re on status 6 : All green, trade will happen,  On status 6 it will basically send the raw info to the specified and chosen coinserver to just give him the info about the TX we need to send


[28-Nov-18 06:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
Works for SRC -> status 7, and do the same for DST


[28-Nov-18 06:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
and if sending the raw info for dst is ok : status 10 : begin sending


[28-Nov-18 06:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
BUT


[28-Nov-18 06:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
the thing is with this strategy, if we achieve to run scripts concurrently with minimal sleeptime... Things can get delayed, or a server / coin can crash


[28-Nov-18 06:38 AM] Deleted User#0000
that mean we would for example stay stuck on status 7 : src has been sent to the server that will process it, but dst failed.


[28-Nov-18 06:38 AM] Deleted User#0000
in that specific case, it s a problem


[28-Nov-18 06:38 AM] Deleted User#0000
cause the coinserver won t care about the specific status of the trade, it will only process what we give and feed him


[28-Nov-18 06:38 AM] Deleted User#0000
so I decided to replace the calls that create the files on Coinserver by a DB version


[28-Nov-18 06:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
it will basically have the same information


[28-Nov-18 06:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
but just with a minimal change of the query we can add requirements like : go if status=10


[28-Nov-18 06:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
and make sure both side are completed at same time


[28-Nov-18 06:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
cause it also could have broken things with current implementation


[28-Nov-18 06:40 AM] Deleted User#0000
we could call this an edge case... but it can happen :


[28-Nov-18 06:40 AM] Deleted User#0000
imagine a trade went good and only the DST raw sending fails


[28-Nov-18 06:40 AM] Deleted User#0000
we re stuck at status 7, infos are already sent to coinserver, and he will process the TX


[28-Nov-18 06:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
but what if any user seeing there is downtime asks for a cancellation


[28-Nov-18 06:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
1st user will have received his share


[28-Nov-18 06:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
and other not, still on buffered address of opposite side


[28-Nov-18 06:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
so a refund would just act as : One user got both funds

[28-Nov-18 06:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
so... after all this speech about optimizing and migrating to db


[28-Nov-18 06:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
every send call has been changed to use that db, and it s working


[28-Nov-18 06:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
Now I have to change every single base script that based itself on file, and just point out the db fields

to allow any 3rd party to interact with us and make swaps even via CLI

after this, optimizing, and adding coins

Base58Check encoding


[28-Nov-18 08:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
```(Beware of bignumber implementations that clip leading 0x00 bytes, or prepend extra 0x00 bytes to indicate sign - your code must handle these cases properly or else you may generate valid-looking addresses which can be sent to, but cannot be spent from - which would lead to the permanent loss of coins.)```


[28-Nov-18 08:20 AM] dukeleto#7326
seems that even btc core allows sending to invalid checksum addresses but they can't be spent from. ouch.


[28-Nov-18 08:23 AM] jl777c#5810
addresses dont exist on the blockchain


[28-Nov-18 08:23 AM] jl777c#5810
i think it issue is if the rmd160 hash has leading base58 nulls and they are suppressed, it ends up being a different hash value that is encoded in the address


[28-Nov-18 08:24 AM] jl777c#5810
all address checksums are validated in the bitcoin code that sends to addresses (that I have seen)


[28-Nov-18 08:32 AM] dukeleto#7326
that wiki may be quite old and wrong, i believe James and yes, addresses don't exist on the blockchain. Still learning that lesson....

Thing I learned today: Sapling addresses are actually bech32 format, not base58, which made me realize how to make the last failing tests pass 😃


[29-Nov-18 12:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
in practice, this means that Sapling zaddrs contain only a-z0-9 chars, while taddrs also contain uppercase (except for O, I), and don't include "l" or zero


[29-Nov-18 12:06 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's invalid for them to have mixed case

Managed to get the new version of sending working with the db. It made me fix some things I couldn t see before. Am at the point the sending goes and I only need to make db moves to reflect the sending.

The status codes for sending part have been implemented more precisely and will be explained in an updated flowchart


[29-Nov-18 09:02 AM] Deleted User#0000
Will manage to rewrite the eth and Z part this evening. Fortunately the T one is one of the most complex as it contatenate txes dynamically

latest part it about eth stuff, I had to adapt it too, the only missing part is the rebranding of the eth specific part that handles the sending. As it will consist to change source of info it won't take long, so I'll be ready for the next... steps 😄


[30-Nov-18 12:41 AM] jl777c#5810
you can also test with sapling activated chain like RKT

About the date : I can only speak about my part : I began revamping Coinsservers code to get stuff rely on db calls instead of file handling. Every type of trade works : that means my next phase (in a few min) will be to clean everything. Fix latest db calls and start making more and more swaps.

When we ll have the confirmation on gui side we ll begin connecting everything and shaping the api (that may not be ready for first tests)


[30-Nov-18 02:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think it should be done pretty fast : ok to test at the end of next week


[30-Nov-18 02:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
Btw for an update about gui : I think most stuff has been done but I can t confirm it myself but so far it looked very good

i just verified my address-validator code is correct. XSG does not have sapling yet, sprout zaddrs only


[01-Dec-18 09:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Sri can you clarify for me, is OOT going to stay on sprout zaddrs, and not upgrade to Sapling? I heard something about that


[01-Dec-18 09:03 AM] Sri#6686
Yes its true Duke


[01-Dec-18 09:04 AM] Sri#6686
We dint see any value with this hard fork for our blockchain.


[01-Dec-18 09:04 AM] Sri#6686
We will go for hard fork for our crypto conditions though, then we would do it


[01-Dec-18 09:06 AM] Sri#6686
Moreover its a pain to deal with our exchanges, they are so lame

hopefully soon you ll have a friendly trading platform @Sri  ^^ (I hope ^^)

@Sri CEX are such a pain dwy, their support staff sucks


[01-Dec-18 09:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
that s also a reason for the app... get a listing on a CEX costs either a lot of money, or a lot of troubles hadling it


[01-Dec-18 09:34 AM] Sri#6686
We paid 3 BTC for exchange listing - 3 exchanges - 9 BTC in total

Recently we had an issue with daemon, sistemkoin, one of our exchange disabled our deposit, withdrawls even now. They take ages to fix anything


[01-Dec-18 09:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
trying to get as much automated stuff as I can, the only problem I face now is I added a lot of coins, and didn t update the register part to get em working as soon as they re synced. Will fix this this evening and test a OOT/ RVN // OOT / XSG


[01-Dec-18 09:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
btw OOT is THE AC I use from the beginning, cause very reliable and fast blocks

(about this fork I'll have to handle it separately, but as it will just be a repo / version change it won t be a problem, just have to consider it as an external coin


[01-Dec-18 09:38 AM] Deleted User#0000

yeah I believe that s a problem for most coins

@here maybe you got friends with a specific chain, KMD or not, if you got suggestions about what to add (excluding ERC20 as I ll handle this stuff after the launch of the beta), just tell me

although VOT doesn't have dpow, maybe they would like to...


[01-Dec-18 09:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
about the code, as it s still unfinished, I keep it private for now


[01-Dec-18 09:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
@dukeleto if it s a coin you love and that have a good community... it s totally possible


[01-Dec-18 09:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
in fact @jorian the code will need to be reviewed for security reason


[01-Dec-18 09:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
but as the repo am on is basically a : git clone and here is the solution working, I think it's dangerous to release it public now


[01-Dec-18 09:50 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Deleted User i wouldn't say love, i guess 😃 Let me think more...


[01-Dec-18 09:52 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Sri the thing is, if your exchange has KMD or any other asset chain, they will need to upgrade that anyway, it's just a scam to charge. Some exchanges do it to Hush as well, but we haven't paid them anything. It's a tough call


[01-Dec-18 09:53 AM] dukeleto#7326
some exchanges want to charge for every asset chain + KMD to update, when it's just KMD repo they need to update. It's a total scam, *cough* digitalprice.io *cough*


[01-Dec-18 09:54 AM] dukeleto#7326
$500 per AC, for nothing


[01-Dec-18 09:54 AM] dukeleto#7326
to literally stop and restart the daemon


[01-Dec-18 09:54 AM] Sri#6686
Digital Price is still affordable Duke 😃 think of 0.5 BTC


[01-Dec-18 09:54 AM] dukeleto#7326
i've dealt with this via BTCH a bit, and HUSH too


[01-Dec-18 09:54 AM] dukeleto#7326
they want to charge for every update, we said no thanks


[01-Dec-18 09:55 AM] dukeleto#7326
and they wont' update to DPoW unless we pay, so they run insecure old code


[01-Dec-18 09:55 AM] Sri#6686
They take weeks to reply to support email, let alone updating nodes


[01-Dec-18 09:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
the next Hush update will disconnect from old non-dpow insecure nodes, exchanges will need to deal with it. I don't support writing free open source code and being charged for every update


[01-Dec-18 09:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
It goes against my being. I would rather leave cryptocoins entirely before I do that


[01-Dec-18 09:56 AM] Sri#6686
Makes sense.


[01-Dec-18 09:57 AM] dukeleto#7326
i've been writing free software and open source for over 20 years. What CEXs do is highway robbery

Btw. A question about funds. And about pirate specifically. How will the upgrade go as addresses won t be the same and we don t have t available


[07-Dec-18 09:03 AM] SHossain#0007
there is `zmigrate` dapp which will migrate funds from zc addr to zs addr with one line of command

A bit of news here, this was a pretty big week, not much coding, but I had the opportunity to speak with crypto people / investors / devs at a meetup in belgium.

Backend part is ready for first testing phase, expected for next week.

First wave of invites will be sent mainly on this channel.

Here we are, time for me to build on clean servers, now the testing phase approaches. New servers ordered


[20-Dec-18 12:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
Managed to migrate the 6 servers overnight on brand new servers. As I pushed older ones to the limit, and damaged one of em running tests, I didn t want to take risks so just reinstalled and splitted everything.

The good point is now I have a strong howto for install and don t need to rely on billions of textfiles everywhere :p

Some coins are still in sync but it should be okay.

Maybe I ll have to skip some to get a very secure setup : last servers were pushed up to 90% hdd use with manual forcing for raid 0 xD

As most chain have sapling activated, the bottleneck for z is mostly gone. That will also require some tweaking to get the correct address gen (sprout vs sapling)


[21-Dec-18 10:45 AM] Deleted User#0000
Finished syncing xsg rvn ltc dash and pivx. 
Eth also.

Only operation remaining before private launch is tweaking the Z addys and retest eth. Will end everything in 1h

Hello there, most information sits on Barterlly s discord. A bridge will be made with this chan in the coming weeks. 

we re finishing the orderbook and am also finishing the whole infra. the bank account is opened and we can fully operate.

Those last months were pretty hard and here again... am candidating for a NN to fund barterlly for servers and such, so have to be some sort of octopus. Don t worry, the objective is still April ;)

Hello everyone :).
As some of you may already know, this year, I'm candidating for a node in **SH region**.
The past year has been very nice : I learned so much thanks to you all who supported me, it was really amazing.
So amazing that I try to contribute more and more, and to find ideas that could help the community. This led me to the creation of a project called **Barterlly**, and here's the true reason behind my proposal : 
I believe this app, and its future versions can be the starting point of something very useful for the community and help spread the word and attract users and devs into KMD ecosystem : Any dpowed assetchain / coin will automatically be listed on the platform (and all "derivative" ones yet to come ;) )

I won't go into tech details on this post, and will just wish you a good election time, but don't forget ! 

**Support Barterlly, Vote for dwy !** :

[13-May-19 11:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
those informations are vital and sensitive to users, atm, we gather some personal data, like email, and are GDPR compliant, but the first or last name are even more sensitive and far more important than an email address. I know there are options where you can find a trusted partner that validates your accounts, and return results via API. But that type of solution, to be compliant by law, need to be checked, and notified in ToS and other legal disclaimers.


[13-May-19 11:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
I need to compare everything to find the most secure way


[13-May-19 11:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
a Jumio style would fit, but tbh not knowing the election results, I had to handle the infra costs... at all costs. Most important thing to me was to be able to launch asap being compliant.

I could just handle those data myself, but i REALLY want to avoid to handle the storage of ID cards etc... That's not the core of Barterlly, and I want to find the best solution for user privacy and keep everything completely compliant.

Asking the community about their experience on different KYC partners could also be a good option.


[13-May-19 11:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
I'm not registered everywhere (I mean personally, I passed KYC on Bittrex, and Kraken, but not other exchanges), and process differs depending on platforms. I will rush into anything related to technical stuff, but when it comes to compliance, I want to go step by step even if it needs more time.


[14-May-19 10:40 AM] Llama#1330
Is there a cap on volume if you don’t kyc, or does it force you to KYC if you get past it?

the cap per day without KYC is 10€k a day

So you put up an offer


[28-May-19 01:13 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Then it's publicised


[28-May-19 01:13 AM] Cryptoon#3362
once someone accepts the offer you deposit the funds you put up for sale in an adress


[28-May-19 01:13 AM] Cryptoon#3362
and not before?


[28-May-19 01:14 AM] Cryptoon#3362
so barterlly doesnt act as an escrow?


[28-May-19 01:14 AM] Cryptoon#3362
arent you afraid you will get a lot of fake offers like that?


[28-May-19 01:45 AM] Oszy#5734
pre-deposit, before offer is accepted, that could speed up the process, and could be a feature, where offer is marked as "transaction is ready to complete" or something.
and if you want to withdraw the offer you could get a refund of your deposit (minus tx fee ofc)

if you have a look 95% of the current offers are insanely stupid, but because there are no deposits in place, no one can make a "bad" trade by accident, unlike you could in hyperdex.


[28-May-19 01:54 AM] ComputerGenie#7004

there are 2 things to consider


[28-May-19 08:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
1) we re still in beta so yeah people test with crazy offers but those offzrs will tend to be drown on the masses of real offers when we will reach more users. Because people seeing it works will just want their offers to be fulfilled.


[28-May-19 08:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
a simple example is... a CEX : you can try to buy KMD for 0.0001 cent or sell at 4 btc each. Noone will answer


[28-May-19 08:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
Barterlly isn t different and we can t enforce rates or max spread


[28-May-19 08:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
this would defeat the OTC concept
What is possible, is an option to autocalculate the target coin price when placing the order, on the user side it s just a checkbox, but internally this requires having a pricefeed for every coin listed


[28-May-19 08:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
2) Prefilling, I know it can be done in less than a day, on tech side of things


[28-May-19 08:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
that would allow people to deposit sooner than expected, we can do this without problems and it would solve the liquidity thing, and speedup trades like crazy. But as you know, we have to focus on szcuring everything before adding more features, and by securing I mean improving both UI and core, based on feedbacks we get


[28-May-19 08:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
Those are features, just like the folio thing I talked about a few days back, we have them in mind and know that could be a gamechanger for active traders

All those suggestions are being reviewed by the team, and will get integrated to a global roadmap. Users believe those can be an advantage and making their life easier? Super cool, we want to adapt and shape to users's feedback, so we **will** consider them, and progressively add them

if I hit F5 it prompts me to log in all the time, is that a session / cookie issue in general or just me?

question: once I've entered refund and rceiving address, can they be viewed/checked during the deposit process? I only see the deposit address after entering both intial addresses


[29-May-19 11:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
nope, atm via api but this info can also be printed as a reminder


[29-May-19 11:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
@Oszy yeah we got the problem on new setup, we re on it


[29-May-19 11:43 AM] jl777c#5810
when CMC?


[29-May-19 11:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
you are not supposed to be logged off while connected and just pasting an offer


[29-May-19 11:45 AM] Deleted User#0000
at first I didnt think it would be possible but now we got a public orderbook and are refining it, public transactions can be reported to CMC, I just don t know if CMC accepts OTC stuff


[29-May-19 11:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
but if that s the case, we ll apply :D


[29-May-19 11:46 AM] Oszy#5734
well, what happens is, for example i am on the public offers page, I press F5 to refresh the page, and it logs me out and takes back to https://app.barterlly.io/


[29-May-19 11:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
yes


[29-May-19 11:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
because of security procedures, this is not expected so something to dix

In fact, to get an insider s view of things, we are gathering feedbacks and stuff and are fixing it on a separate infrastructure. as people begin to trade we will just adopt a standardized maintenance procedure and scheduling


[29-May-19 11:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
we can t hotfix too much frequently so we re bundling everything before updates


[29-May-19 11:49 AM] Oszy#5734
understand, no worries 😃 just trying to report as much as I find


[29-May-19 11:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
it s very kind, and in fact that is what will help us shape things as user want. Because developping in a closed circle didn t give us enough feedback, your tests are precious

[29-May-19 11:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
sure


[29-May-19 11:54 AM] Oszy#5734
when i click on any offer, it stays in my offer even tho I haven't accepted nor rejected it, is this intentional? it fills up my offer list with offers i just checked on


[29-May-19 11:58 AM] Deleted User#0000
yeah


[29-May-19 11:58 AM] Oszy#5734
the other thing, is just some UI improvement, when you hover over the rows in a pairing, you can hardly distinguish the rows.  the two background colors are too similar: #191b24 & #181a23
and separate ask and bid sides with a bright line would be helpful everything is so dark and close to each other


[29-May-19 11:58 AM] Deleted User#0000
this was reported, in fact it don t act like you accepted


[29-May-19 11:58 AM] Deleted User#0000
see this like a cart


[29-May-19 11:59 AM] Oszy#5734
ok I get it


[29-May-19 11:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
if you cancel, the offer will just be back available


[29-May-19 11:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
here again, adding a checkbox to add to cart is possible


[29-May-19 11:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
please, nothing disturbs, and every feedback will allow us to refine


[29-May-19 12:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
even big ideas and cha'ges like prefilling or folio comes from users


[29-May-19 12:01 PM] Oszy#5734
I could imagine something like a JS overlay when you select a row it just pops up on top of everything so you could "quick view" the offer without commited to accepting it. seeing just 3 numbers not trivial for everyone.


[29-May-19 12:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
we got it on our list, our first most important goal here is to make private swaps possible


[29-May-19 12:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
in fact, we believe the current orderbook is not user friendly enough


[29-May-19 12:01 PM] Oszy#5734
you mean unlisted offers via invite only


[29-May-19 12:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
yes, because public ones are just privates with only 1 side identified


[29-May-19 12:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
so if private are stable as hell, public is just GUI handling


[29-May-19 12:03 PM] Oszy#5734
sounds good.


[29-May-19 12:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
see this as something modular


[29-May-19 12:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
for example people would love to prefill order for fast trades


[29-May-19 12:04 PM] Oszy#5734
yes.

was totally focused on alternate development to add more security with brand new tools that will help us protect trades live with some features, the goal is to make users more safe in case of chain being attacked. I needed to end the NH detection tracking tool to allow the app react dynamically in case abnormal behaviour is detected on specific chains


[14-Jun-19 05:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
It's nearly finished, and we have to integrate it to the core to add a "variance" in case any chain got attacked


[14-Jun-19 05:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
that being the 1st subject


[14-Jun-19 05:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
the second one I started was to automatically report any fork directly on the app, to prevent users from trading when i'ts a total mess in an attacked chain, adding modifier in case the chain is at risk, to prevent users from trading on potential bad chain.


[14-Jun-19 06:00 PM] Deleted User#0000

We are opening back the app, and will resume operations in a few minutes. We activated fees, that are set to 1% on top of transactions happening on the platform, refunds excluded.
A new coin joined the list of active tradeable coins, we're now at 4/5 of top100 CMC integrated on the platform, more to come in the following weeks :).
Some icons are not updated, and will be hotfixed in the coming days.
See you soon !

[22-Jun-19 07:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
Fees are not activated for a long time, and we see that day after day, more and more people test the app, with little or big amounts. Confidence will be built on a longterm basis.
Our goal is to be totally compliant, and show transparency to bring trust. One of the upcoming phase will be to release our internal bots to get live any type of offers, notably completed ones.
Basing ourselves on a ratio between cancelled / performed swaps, the Profile section and choice to share it publicly or not (users having the choice), added to an optionnal minimal ratio to accept trades, will also prevent the ping-ponging of cancelled trades.

[26-Jun-19 03:49 PM] Alecandro#1179
Can someone explain to me how Barterlly works exactly? So if you generate a public offer with your refund address for the coin you're trying to sell, then add your receiving address for the coin you want to collect, how does it actually send the coin you want to sell to the person?


[26-Jun-19 03:49 PM] Alecandro#1179
Or is there a second step once the offer is accepted?


[26-Jun-19 03:59 PM] owerache#0341
Barterlly is an over the counter (OTC) cryptocurrency swap service that allows direct trading without human escrow. Let's say that Alice has 800 Ravencoin (RVN) and Bob has 450 EnJin (ENJ erc20) and they want to swap them, how can they proceed? They don't know each other. Neither can't risk to send first. There are many stories of people getting scammed while trading privately. They will have to find someone with an excellent reputation who will act as escrow. This is an inconvenient procedure that takes time, risk and high fees. Barterlly offers a fast and simple alternative: Alice can setup a private trade of 800 RVN <-> 450 ENJ and send the link to Bob. Once both sides have deposited their coins, Barterlly makes the swap (or refunds if anything goes wrong).

Okay, don't stress out. In an 1,5hour I am in bed and early on morning heading to work so it gives you roughly 20 hours of time before I am back on my computer. Thanks for your help.

Hello everyone !
We are preparing the next update, that may take a bit of time to deploy, and redirected the app / website / templates to a temporary provider. The error you will encounter is linked to HSTS and is totally normal. A fix can be done here : https://www.thesslstore.com/blog/clear-hsts-settings-chrome-firefox/
We processed a full refund on all assets currently listed on the platform, as it may take time, and we don't want to do anything in a rush, we prefered to get every user having still funds on the platform refunded before the downtime.
We don't give a date for reopening yet, as we will first focus on implementing everything on the new infrastructure on our dev nodes, and add every features we developped dring the past monthes.
We will also use that time to search for investors, that will help us make this journey a success. The GUI is ready to go to the next level, as the core, and we really want it to get properly done.
See you soon !

Hello there, a lot happened during the last few weeks, on the tech side we were able to finish the ERC20, and the whole codebase was refined to allow unlimited scalability and more independance on coins handling. New code also allow to handle any type of coin, be it Z, XTZ, Monero and any chain.

Unfortunately, after all revelations about tech stuff on KMD, I personally am not seen as a good relation anymore. I just hope people won't be shocked discovering all I tried to do to improve the ecosystem, and was just seen as bad actions, whereas it was done to avoid multiple mistakes that were done by the past, and that could just destroy the credibility of KMD's marvellous ideology and project.

We invested monthes of our time without any tech support or financial one, some guys helped, thanks @KomodoWorld for all you have done for us but unfortunately, we can t wait anymore for a real funding coming from the ecosystem.


[18-Aug-19 04:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
To launch the platform fully, we need to be fully compliant, but don't have the funds to achieve this. The opportunity is huge, but we can t afford costs without a proper investor.
Discussions were started monthes ago, but no clear but wait answer was given.

We have no choice but to go on totally limited version. Our code is safe, real, as people tried it and enjoyed it. Templating and API and wallet integration are really mind blowing. But we can t achieve this alone.

Whitelabel solutions were also done and could have helped KMD ecosystem a lot, notably by adding stablecoins, and involving brokers. 

Lack of financial help led us to this.
We will try to come back, and search for real investors, and will detach from KMD progressively, as it doesn't respect our fairness and transparency standards.

This is an open call : we are actively searching for a real investor that want to take advantage of our automated escrow solution.
Private tests showing our skills and the adaptability of our solution will be possible for interested investors.

Being honest is what will transform and make this journey a success.

See you soon ;)

@Deleted User I don't know what is going on behind the scenes, but would like to thank you for your contribution. I personally like barterlly and I hope you will be able to find an investor(s). DEXes are new reality and maybe BTC recovery can help you with your goal.

Sorry to hear about the service, absent flaky buyers, I've had nothing but good experiences. With that said, did you try reaching out to the guys in #venturecapital ? I'm guessing you have but if you haven't, might be worth your time.


[19-Aug-19 06:00 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
"flaky buyers" should only exist in the "bonus" features
If you find some using the main escrow bits, you should let folks know

We tried, and this was just a loss of time

the dev infrastructure is being set up right now, with limited assets and totally private, to reduce costs, ERC20 are a big deal, and true investors will see that it really can be a good project, especially when you see so much exchanges having issues handling Z


[19-Aug-19 07:14 AM] Deleted User#0000
Paying crazy fees to little exchanges is alright, but it seems even being listed on very little exchanges don't give the guarantee to have it working properly, unfortunately. We proved it was totally functionnal with ARRR, so time will tell 🙂


[19-Aug-19 07:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
People should not forget we are only 2 on tech side, and never lost funds / had specific issues, no matter the coin or tech involved, this, to me, is more trustable than anything ^^


[19-Aug-19 07:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
the fact that we have a powerful API and can be integrated to anything / produce whitelabelled solution in minutes, be integrated to wallet without any risk, or get a mobile app / Chrome plugin like metamask will make the difference


[19-Aug-19 07:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
we are changing our way of handling the business side, and are researching real investors to get real shares of the company, still not relying on any ICO, but official papers, legal papers 😉


[19-Aug-19 07:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
those weeks made us learn a lot both on legal, business, and tech side. People were frustrated by counterparties cancelling, but the system now allow even more easily a ranking and reputation system.

`If you find some using the main escrow bits, you should let folks know` As in people posts offers and have no intention of sending after I accept their listed price.`


[19-Aug-19 05:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
offer and demand :(. As all works on chain, it can t be as fast as an exchange, cause the blockchain is the proof. There are systems that will allow faster trades, like prefill, but it induces being in charge of coins not ours far more time than if there is a critical mass of users using it. We prefer to let people have their coins into their own wallets :)


[19-Aug-19 08:05 PM] bishop#9773
They post the offer, I accept it and then they renig. It's the counterparty being shitty


[19-Aug-19 08:06 PM] bishop#9773
if you don't want to trade at that price, don't post an offer. Post offers you are content on filling with a counterparty. If you are too lazy to update your prices as the market changes, that's on you.

Google trends for "OTC Crypto", which refers to the large transfers for trading $Crypto 'Over The Counter' has a lot of interest based in CA. i.e. Silicon Valley.

Maybe nothing, but this could be indicative of more startups/HF's looking to divert capital to Crypto or $BTC
