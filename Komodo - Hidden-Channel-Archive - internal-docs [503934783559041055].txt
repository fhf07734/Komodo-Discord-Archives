I'll let mylo explain what we're doing. 

I spent a few days last week researching what other projects are doing for documentation.

You can see the my notes and a quick summary here:

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YsE9R6xkXNApB1KGlG942zJpImrpcxG7TXtwxlNRUEg/edit?usp=sharing

EOS, Zilliqa, and NEM all have very nice documentation centers.

I am just going through: https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/ . This component stuff is so powerful. Way too much freedom. Easy to add a lot of bells and whistles. Dark mode is a cinch. Custom font type/size, we can have a pop out config location to set all these. We can have a user select linux/mac/win and they won't have to even look at the docs related to the other 2 os es. And as  sid said, we can have them input their home location etc., and we can programmatically generate custom commands for them.

This is so cool!

So, I just got Slate up and running.

I think there's something missing in the setup instructions, fyi.

You have to install ruby to make it work, and the ubuntu apt for ruby isn't up to date, and didn't build Slate properly when I tried it. 

I had to install rbenv first, which had another difficulty.

When you get to the step where it tells you to do this: `rbenv init`, you need to also add the following to your `~./bashrc` file

export PATH=$PATH:~/.rbenv/shims

Then close and reopen your terminal.

Then you can install Ruby. I did v 2.5.2

Slate is a really nice tool. Very easy to use. 

I'm mostly just writing right now, very little code required.

@Mylo @gcharang @SHossain 

Take a look and tell me what you think.

https://siddhartha-komodo.github.io/slate/

It's not a finished product, and I need to change things, still. I haven't yet fixed the stuff that you and I talked about earlier today, @SHossain -- meaning the stuff about binaries and install locations on different machines etc.


[25-Oct-18 02:31 AM] Mylo#8306
That's awesome!  Even the search works!   Being able to link to specific settings is so useful, especially with accompanying document/commentary/articles/tutorials.

Could you please see if there's a way to create issues on the slate project in your github, so change requests can be tracked/commented etc. for team members.  I wanna create an issue and this will be a good way to introduce the rest of the team to your effort.

What do you think?

@Bryan_Beus for displaying the webpage at  https://siddhartha-komodo.github.io/slate/ , are you using the travis functionality available, or you using the `deploy.sh` script?


[26-Oct-18 06:27 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
just the deploy.sh script.


[26-Oct-18 06:28 AM] gcharang#6833
I can work on making it work with Travis-ci -- this makes it build the pages just after accepting a PR, you won't need to pull locally, build, then use `deploy.sh` again. Will that be useful?


[26-Oct-18 06:30 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
possibly, thank you for thinking on this. let's wait until it's finished.

I'm working through the wallet section now. I think I should be done before the day is done, and then we'll add cc and deploy. 

I will probably add barterdex, afterwards.

Once I'm done with the brunt of the work, I would appreciate your help searching for errors. This is very repetitive work, prone to typical human error. I suspect that a few times, I have accidentally copy/pasted something to the wrong location, or deleted something important, etc. 

If you can help me search through afterwards and test/verify everything, that would be great.

Once unzipped, you should find komodod and komodo-cli in the directory where you unzipped the zip file.

example location of Agama is not needed if they download the zips from your specified link in the docs.

it is a best practice to compile the binaries locally for the end-user while testing. this ensures more reliable testing.

`/komodo/src` is if you compiled it locally. not if you unzipped them in another directory.

`cd` into the directory where you have the binaries  unzipped or use `cd ~/komodo/src` if you compiled them locally to start using the bianries.

please edit the start command to `./komodod &` or `./komodod -daemon` without the `&` or `-daemon` param, if the user try to issue another command in the same terminal, `komodod` will stop and `komodo-cli` will not work.

for these 2 commands, use `./` in front of both. otherwise, the commands will fail (unless the user copied the the binaries inside `/usr/local/bin/`)

@SHossain 

If you don't want blocks to be on-demand, how do you indicate that in the asset-chain parameters?


[29-Oct-18 02:20 PM] SHossain#0007
if you dont' want them on demand, you need to make them minable with block reward or staked or both of them


[29-Oct-18 02:22 PM] SHossain#0007
90% staking and 10% mining
```

100% mining

When you do `ac_end`, does that mean that the block reward goes down to 10000 satoshis, or does it mean that there is truly 0 block reward for miners thereon?

[29-Oct-18 02:34 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Do we have any asset chains that have 0 block rewards -- meaning, whatever coin supply you have, it's not going to have some drift in the coin supply, due to a 0.0001 mining reward?


[29-Oct-18 02:36 PM] SHossain#0007
there is none currently. i believe after the mining ends, they become on-demand


[29-Oct-18 02:36 PM] SHossain#0007
@jl777c please correct me if i am wrong


[29-Oct-18 02:36 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
We've had issues in the past where some on-demand blockchain are not notarized for long periods of time, while transactions are sitting in the mempool.


[29-Oct-18 02:36 PM] jl777c#5810
on-demandness doesnt change


[29-Oct-18 02:37 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Right, I understand the concept of on-demand, though I think in practice it appears that it only works ever 10 to 30 txs.

But, before we get into that, I'm wondering about just doing `ac_end`. Can you please confirm with me that it's absolute 0 for a block reward? I've just never heard of that.


[29-Oct-18 02:38 PM] SHossain#0007
if there is tx in mempool, there will be a new block and notarization will continue (for on-demand chain)


[29-Oct-18 02:38 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
you're killing me shossain 🤣


[29-Oct-18 02:39 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@jl777c 

Can you please confirm with me that `ac_end` brings the block reward down to absolute 0?


[29-Oct-18 02:42 PM] jl777c#5810
yes


[29-Oct-18 02:42 PM] jl777c#5810
other than txfees


[29-Oct-18 02:42 PM] jl777c#5810
but it doesnt change whether it is on-demand or not


[29-Oct-18 02:46 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Thank you.

On the on-demand part, you and I discussed a few months ago the fact that on-demand doesn't mean that a block is mined for just a single transaction. 

It appears that it takes 10 to 20 transactions for the miners to get triggered? 

I've had some conversations about webworker with this as well. He's set up some process to try to make sure that relatively inactive chains get mined, but apparently, it's not always working. ? I can follow up with him to find out what's going on.

Right now is the time to create documentation that advises our users how to securely use an on-demand setting. Or, to avoid it, if necessary.

What would you suggest to developers in this regard?


[29-Oct-18 02:46 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@jl777c ^^


[29-Oct-18 02:48 PM] jl777c#5810
one tx in the mempool is enough to start mining for on-demand


[29-Oct-18 02:48 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Why weren't BLOC and a few other chains advancing, then?


[29-Oct-18 02:48 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442

Looking again real quick.


[29-Oct-18 02:49 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it was diff stranded


[29-Oct-18 02:49 PM] SHossain#0007
@Bryan_Beus there are no on-demand chain currently that is stalled

@jl777c 

Okay, so if I put something together that says something along the lines of,

"If you elect to use the on-demand block system on a blockchain that has low activity, you should be sure to always have nodes availble to mine single transactions as soon as they appear. Your node should have sufficient hash rate also, as low hash-rate nodes can cause the `besttip` blockchain to become diff stranded."


[29-Oct-18 02:54 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Something along those lines


[29-Oct-18 02:54 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442

Thanks. 

It does look much better than when we looked at it back in April.

This site was built after April and that was the beginning of this Notary season.


[29-Oct-18 02:56 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
webworker was saying that on low-activity blockchains, it might be necessary to have a node setup that detects single transactions stranded in the mempool, and the node sends out a few small transactions when this happens to trigger a full notarization.


[29-Oct-18 02:56 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@SHossain 

That's right. The conversation we had must have occurred in May - July. I don't remember when. I think it was one of the first conversations I had here on Discord, so whenever that was.


[29-Oct-18 02:57 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I think I'm getting confused between mining and notarization, now that the conversation is coming back to me.


[29-Oct-18 02:57 PM] SHossain#0007
every chain has to have miner. either using CPU, GPU or ASIC. that applies to on-demand, or minable chain


[29-Oct-18 02:57 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I don't think the problem was ever that blocks were no occuring. My bad.


[29-Oct-18 02:57 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I think it was that notarizations were not occuring.


[29-Oct-18 02:58 PM] SHossain#0007
blocks and notarization are different


[29-Oct-18 02:58 PM] jl777c#5810
that has not much to do with ondemand


[29-Oct-18 02:58 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Okay.


[29-Oct-18 03:02 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
My underlying concern is that it looks really bad if we say "ten to twenty minutes to get notarized," but then notarizations are not happening for longer than that. 

I was on the phone with a prospective client at the time (that privacy medical device guy), and he was looking at the notarization times and was confused about why the notarizations weren't happening as promised.

When I look at the list of notarized coins now, I see a lot of them haven't been notarized in over 10 to 20 minutes. 

It is very much better than it was a few months ago. Back then, I think we had a few asset chains that had not been notarized in over 24 hours. 

But still, if some asset chains are at forty minutes to an hour, or some even up to five hours, it would be good for me to put something in the documentation that explains this. 

For example, right now, we have CEAL with 5 blocks that haven't been notarized, and it's been over an hour. 

?


[29-Oct-18 03:02 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Is there a certain number of blocks that need to occur, before the notarization kicks in?


[29-Oct-18 03:02 PM] jl777c#5810
no


[29-Oct-18 03:03 PM] jl777c#5810
but if a chain isnt generating blocks, there is nothing to notarize


[29-Oct-18 03:06 PM] SHossain#0007
you just missed that type of stats in the site that some nodes hasn't been notarized for over 24 hours, until few hours ago. those were on-demand chains and didn't have any new tx on the chain.
no tx = no blocks = no notarization


[29-Oct-18 03:07 PM] SHossain#0007
but, that doesn't mean that those chains are not secure.

[29-Oct-18 03:08 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure what problem you are talking about


[29-Oct-18 03:43 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
There seems to be a mental disconnect between what the developers are saying and what the marketers are saying.

If we say, "10 to 20 minutes to get notarized into KMD," then as a marketer, in my mind, all of those blocks should be included in a hash and inserted into KMD within 10 to 20 minutes.

But it sounds like you're saying that it's normal for there to be a few blocks trailing in an unsecured state for more than 10 to 20 minutes? If so, we need to come up with a different way of describing this?


[29-Oct-18 03:44 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Or can we create some kind of recommended best practice, for those who want to make sure that all blocks are included in a hash and inserted into KMD within 10 to 20 minutes?


[29-Oct-18 03:45 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
For example, right now, there are three blocks for BNTN that haven't been notarized in an hour and a half.


[29-Oct-18 04:20 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@jl777c 

If a developer is concerned about having any blocks trailing at all for more than 10 to 20 minutes, what would you recommend they do?


[29-Oct-18 04:27 PM] SHossain#0007
Generate and broadcast transaction or mine blocks.


[29-Oct-18 04:28 PM] SHossain#0007
Look at KMDICE chain. it is being mined. How much lag does it have? KMD to BTC, how much lag does it have? EMC2 to KMD, how much lag does it have?


[29-Oct-18 04:29 PM] SHossain#0007
we do not guarantee 100% notarization at all times.


[29-Oct-18 04:29 PM] SHossain#0007
BNTN is a very low use on-demand chain.


[29-Oct-18 04:30 PM] SHossain#0007
until the next notarization happens, those txs are not secured by dPoW.


[29-Oct-18 04:31 PM] SHossain#0007
in order for notarization to continue normal, there has to be new blocks generated.


[29-Oct-18 04:32 PM] SHossain#0007
You can test it by yourself. send some tx one by one with 1 minute interval on BNTN network with as low as 0.1 or even 0.01 and see if notarization happens or not.


[29-Oct-18 04:38 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ok, I'll put that in there as the best practice. Thank you, both.


[29-Oct-18 05:11 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Here's a quick sketch. @jl777c @SHossain 

Let me know what you think.

### A Note About Low-Activity Blockchains

The Komodo security system, dPoW, functions best for asset chains that are being actively used. If there is an end-user performing a transaction every minute on average, dPoW should function as normal. This includes hashing the asset chain's most recent state and inserting it into the KMD blockchain every ten to twenty minutes on average (and from there, a hash protecting this data is soon pushed into the Bitcoin blockchain).

Many blockchains will not be used on a regular basis, however. The developers also may not elect to have any block rewards that would act as an incentive for miners to maintain activity on the chain.

It is not economically efficient to notarize every single block that occurs. Therefore Komodo's dPoW security system requires several blocks to be generated on a moderately consistent basis before a notarizations will be performed. Without activity or miners, the notarization process naturally will stall.

This creates a situation which is easily remedied, but only if the developer is proactive to maintain activity on their chain. We advise asset-chain developers who do not expect frequent transaction volume on to ensure activity anytime an end-user utilizes their chain, and for which notarization security is required. A simple solution is to always have a node that is watching for transactions on the asset chain. When a transaction occurs from an end-user, the node should be set up with a script to perform minimum-amount transactions until the end-user's transaction is notarized, and then the script can cease activity.

The amount it costs to perform these occasional minimum-amount transactions is cheaper than it would cost to perform a full notarization every ten to twenty minutes.


[30-Oct-18 12:47 AM] jl777c#5810
ok


[30-Oct-18 12:38 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@SHossain 

What is `nLockTime` in this example?

It's on the `ac_staked` description, as a rule for staking a utxo.

```* A utxo is not eligible for staking without `nLockTime` set and until 6000 seconds has passed from this lock time. (100 * expected blocktimes) to be exact```


[30-Oct-18 12:41 PM] SHossain#0007
nLockTime is same locktime that requires for Komodo reward accruring. it is just the timestamp set when the tx was done


[30-Oct-18 12:42 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ok, adding that one sec


[30-Oct-18 12:45 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
How do you set nLockTime?


[30-Oct-18 12:45 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@SHossain


[30-Oct-18 12:45 PM] SHossain#0007
it is set by the daemon or app when sending tx


[30-Oct-18 12:46 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok, so it's handled automatically, correct?


[30-Oct-18 12:46 PM] SHossain#0007
yes


[30-Oct-18 12:46 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok


[30-Oct-18 12:46 PM] SHossain#0007
but, Ledger and some other app can't set it


[30-Oct-18 12:46 PM] SHossain#0007
or they don't set it


[30-Oct-18 12:47 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
What does the part about "to be more exact...etc"?


[30-Oct-18 12:47 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
mean?


[30-Oct-18 12:47 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
This part:


[30-Oct-18 12:47 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
(100 * expected blocktimes) to be exact


[30-Oct-18 12:48 PM] SHossain#0007
approx 100 minutes if the expected blocktime is 1 minute


[30-Oct-18 12:48 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
what is it referncing, though?


[30-Oct-18 12:48 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
the context?


[30-Oct-18 12:49 PM] SHossain#0007
when you send a tx, that utxo will be ready for staking after 100 blocks


[30-Oct-18 12:49 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ok, thank you.


[30-Oct-18 01:06 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@SHossain 

Which command do you use to submit a coin for staking?


[30-Oct-18 01:08 PM] SHossain#0007
there are 2 ways of doing this.
1. start the chain with these added params `-gen -genproclimit=0`
2. start the chain normally and issue this command `./komodo-cli -ac_name=COIN setgenerate true 0`


[30-Oct-18 01:16 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
so, the `nLockTime` property is just from the transaction of the utxo, which could have been performed before the coin was staking, I take it?

I somehow came under the mistaken impression that you had to indicate which coins you want to stake with a separate transaction.


[30-Oct-18 01:17 PM] jl777c#5810
staking is just mining with 0 threads


[30-Oct-18 01:18 PM] jl777c#5810
you can stake with utxo that dont have nLockTime set


[30-Oct-18 01:20 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok, I'm rewriting some of this now. Very helpful. Thank you.


[30-Oct-18 01:40 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@SHossain 

Can you please verify this?

```
### Notes on How ac_staked Functions

To initiate staking, include `-gen -genproclimit=0` as a launch parameter while starting the daemon, or execute `./komodo-cli -ac_name=CHAIN_NAME setgenerate true 0` after launching the daemon.

Once staking is active, utxos available in the wallet.dat file will be set to stake automatically.  

On an `ac_staked` asset chain there are 64 global segments (`segid`'s) to which all utxos belong, and these 64 `segid`s will automatically take turns mining blocks. The method of determining which segment a utxo belongs to is determined automatically, according to the hash of the address in which the utxo resides.

You can see which segment an address belongs to by using the [`validateaddress`](#validateaddress) rpc call. You can find out the amount of rewards your staked coins have earned via the [`getbalance64`](#getbalance64) rpc call.

Each staked block will have an additional transaction added to the coinbase in which the coins that staked the block are sent back to the same address. This is used to verify which coins staked the block, and this allows for compatibility with existing Komodo infrastructure. If `ac_staked` is used in conjunction with [`ac_perc`](#ac_perc), the [`ac_pubkey`](#ac_pubkey) address will receive slightly more coins for each staked block compared to a mined block because of this extra transaction.
```


[30-Oct-18 01:46 PM] SHossain#0007
Looks ok. Not sure about the last line if that is correct


[30-Oct-18 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
its not added to coinbase, it is added at the end of the block


[30-Oct-18 01:48 PM] jl777c#5810
the ac_perc applies to total tx value in the block, so it doesnt change the rules to have the extra staked tx at the end of the block


[30-Oct-18 01:54 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@jl777c 

Take a look at this please:

```
Each staked block will have an additional transaction added to the end of the block in which the coins that staked the block are sent back to the same address.

[30-Oct-18 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810

[30-Oct-18 01:55 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
thanks


[30-Oct-18 02:11 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@SHossain 

Can you verify this, please?

```
* A utxo is not eligible for staking until a certain amount of time has passed after its creation. By default, it is 6000 seconds. More precisely, a utxo is not eligible for staking until `100 * the median time to mine a new block`. For example, utxos on a one-minute block time asset chain would be eligible for staking after one-hundred minutes.

* The property `nLockTime` must be set. `nLockTime` is typically set at the time the utxo is created and is managed automatically, according to the `timestamp` of the utxo. Some third-party wallets (Ledger, for example) do not handle `nLockTime` by default, in which case staking will not function.

```


[30-Oct-18 02:13 PM] SHossain#0007
locktime is not a requirement


[30-Oct-18 02:13 PM] SHossain#0007
```

jl777cToday at 20:17

you can stake with utxo that dont have nLockTime set
```


[30-Oct-18 02:19 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok, I don't actually understand any of this. 😃 So I'm just trying to figure it out based on what you're telling me.


[30-Oct-18 02:20 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@SHossain 

Out of those last two paragraphs, can you please cut/paste and rewrite to help me figure out what I'm not understanding?


[30-Oct-18 02:22 PM] jl777c#5810
delete the paragraph with The property `nLockTime`


[30-Oct-18 02:22 PM] jl777c#5810
you are maybe confusing with rewards claiming


[30-Oct-18 02:23 PM] jl777c#5810
staking has nothing to do with rewards claiming, other than both are utxo based


[30-Oct-18 02:27 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok.

so, the part about Ledger not being able to set anything -- we don't need to include that in the docs?


[30-Oct-18 02:27 PM] SHossain#0007
no.


[30-Oct-18 02:27 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok, great


[30-Oct-18 02:47 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@SHossain 

I don't understand this paragraph.

* Coinage calculated from the adjusted time is used to divide hash (address + pastblockhash) to create the value compared against the difficulty to determine if a block is won or not. This means a UTXO is more likely to win a block within a segid based on age of the UTXO and amount of coins.

@jl777c 

I'm finally to the point where I can start writing CC docs. Have the ones on github loaded up in my editor ready to go.

when you get a chance, I need to talk with you about strategy.

If we're going to have 1000s of smart contracts, that's not something that I'm going to be able to manage manually. I will likely need to build a database where users can enter their own documentation into a pre-set template or something, and have a link to their username where people can ask questions. 

?


[02-Nov-18 12:50 PM] jl777c#5810
I havent solved how to manage thousands of CC. we have less than a dozen now, why not to document what we have before worrying about what to do 3 years from now?

[02-Nov-18 09:58 PM] jl777c#5810
then one per day


[02-Nov-18 09:58 PM] jl777c#5810
no idea


[02-Nov-18 09:58 PM] jl777c#5810
depends on number of devs, seems to take about 1 dev month per CC

ok


[03-Nov-18 08:21 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Which ones will be available in the default daemon come the next hard fork?

I'll make documentation for those, and then let github be the repo for everything else.


[03-Nov-18 08:31 AM] gcharang#6833
Atleast : faucet,tokens,rewards,dice

btw, the above four are in the default repo right now, but not active in the KMD chain. The above four might be activated on the KMD chain in the next hardfork. If these don't get activated for some reason, the latter ones definitely won't be

In the dice chain


[06-Nov-18 10:39 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
what specifically is a `fundingtxid`?

For example, is it a special type of txid, or a txid that was created using `diceaddfunds` rpc call, or is it the txid of the transaction that did the `dicefund` rpc call?


[06-Nov-18 10:43 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442

[06-Nov-18 12:28 PM] jl777c#5810
fundingtxid is the txid of the funding txid


[06-Nov-18 12:29 PM] jl777c#5810
the one that creates the dice plan


[06-Nov-18 12:29 PM] jl777c#5810
sbits is a binary encoding of the name (first 8 chars)


[06-Nov-18 12:33 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
great thanks


[06-Nov-18 12:53 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@jl777c 

Can you have more than one faucet on an asset chain?


[06-Nov-18 12:55 PM] jl777c#5810
not with faucet CC


[06-Nov-18 12:57 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok


[06-Nov-18 02:23 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@jl777c 

Currently, the `rewardsinfo` rpc call does not have it listed that it accepts a `pubkey` argument, but I think this is a mistake?

And by default, `rewardsinfo` uses the `pubkey` that was used to launch the daemon, correct?


[06-Nov-18 02:25 PM] jl777c#5810
rewardsinfo only accepts the rewardsid (txid of the create)


[06-Nov-18 02:25 PM] jl777c#5810
does not accept pubkey, why do you think it accepts pubkey?


[06-Nov-18 02:53 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok. It doesn't have anything here, I was just guessing.


[06-Nov-18 03:10 PM] jl777c#5810
most info calls are info about a specific instance, which is denoted by the txid of the creation


[06-Nov-18 03:14 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
what are the arguments for `rewardsunlock`?

There's very little in the docs.


[06-Nov-18 03:28 PM] jl777c#5810
you can do ./komodo-cli help


[06-Nov-18 03:28 PM] jl777c#5810
rewardsaddfunding name fundingtxid amount
rewardsaddress [pubkey]
rewardscreatefunding name amount APR mindays maxdays mindeposit
rewardsinfo fundingtxid
rewardslist
rewardslock name fundingtxid amount
rewardsunlock name fundingtxid [txid]


[06-Nov-18 03:29 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
thanks


[06-Nov-18 03:29 PM] jl777c#5810
most should make sense


[06-Nov-18 03:29 PM] jl777c#5810
rewardsunlock, unlocks the locked funds from a rewardslock


[06-Nov-18 03:29 PM] jl777c#5810
the name and fundingtxid refer to the specific plan


[06-Nov-18 03:29 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
the [txid] is the txid that was used to lock the funds originally, correct?


[06-Nov-18 03:29 PM] jl777c#5810
[txid] to the locking txid


[06-Nov-18 03:36 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
If I lose my txid after broadcasting the raw transaction, do I need to go through my `listtransactions` results, or is there a method that can call any txids I have in association with a particular rewards plan?


[06-Nov-18 03:40 PM] jl777c#5810
broadcast the txid again


[06-Nov-18 03:40 PM] jl777c#5810
i mean broadcast the rawtx again


[06-Nov-18 03:41 PM] jl777c#5810
the caller needs to remember the locked txid they made, it is possible to scan it via getaddressutxos


[06-Nov-18 03:41 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ok.


[07-Nov-18 12:25 AM] Mylo#8306
these are handy hints for GUI devs to limit users making mistakes


[07-Nov-18 12:25 AM] Mylo#8306
e.g. `getaddressutxos` when locked txid seems to have gone missing i presume


[07-Nov-18 11:32 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@jl777c 

Can you please verify this?

Here are a few example outputs from a `tokenorders` rpc call.

[07-Nov-18 11:32 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Try copy/pasting my description into a text editor that doesn't have soft wrap


[07-Nov-18 11:33 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
that will let you see how they differentiate.


[07-Nov-18 11:34 AM] jl777c#5810
tonyL and siu are familiar with tokens, and it is good to make sure they understand your descriptions. it seems ok to me


[07-Nov-18 11:37 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok

the `totalrequired` is correct? 

I don't understand how `amount`, `bidamount`/`askamount`, and `totalamount` differentiate?

@siu @TonyL 

Lmk if you have comments, please.


[07-Nov-18 11:48 AM] jl777c#5810
totalamount is the original total amount


[07-Nov-18 11:48 AM] jl777c#5810
amount is what is left


[07-Nov-18 11:57 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok


[07-Nov-18 11:58 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
In `rewardsaddress`, I need descriptions for these two properties. 

```

RewardsCCassets                              |(string)
```


[07-Nov-18 11:59 AM] TonyL#3577
@Bryan_Beus Yep, description of `tokenorders` params seems clear


[07-Nov-18 12:00 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok, I just updated two things


[07-Nov-18 12:00 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
let me repost real quick


[07-Nov-18 12:00 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442

copy/paste that into a text editor


[07-Nov-18 12:02 PM] TonyL#3577
`GatewaysPubkey` is pubkey of gatewaysCC - on this pubkey you converting the tokens for binding with gatewayCC. I'm not sure tbh why by design it's printing in all `%CC%address` output


[07-Nov-18 12:02 PM] TonyL#3577
@Bryan_Beus maybe in price describing somehow reflect that token is the same token as tokenid above?


[07-Nov-18 12:03 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I don't understand about the gateways thing.

Is there some kind of default binding to a CC gateway or something?


[07-Nov-18 12:08 PM] TonyL#3577
GatewaysPubkey as I understand relates only to GatewaysCC and const for all assetchains. @jl777c am I correct?
But it showing in all %CC%address outputs so maybe I'm wrong


[07-Nov-18 12:09 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
the two properties:

```
GatewaysPubkey                               |(string)
RewardsCCassets                              |(string)
```

they're in the `rewardsaddress` method.


[07-Nov-18 12:09 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, in all %CC%address outputs, for let's say `diceaddress` GatewaysPubkey showing as well


[07-Nov-18 12:12 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm not familiar with the `%CC%address` output thing you're referencing


[07-Nov-18 12:12 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I need a description to put in those two properties on the `rewardsaddress` method.


[07-Nov-18 12:14 PM] TonyL#3577
By %CC%address I meant name of some CC and `address` then in RPC call
I'm not totally sure for what is `RewardsCCassets` address :/


[07-Nov-18 12:18 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
okay, thank you


[07-Nov-18 12:19 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@jl777c

Can you please give me a description of these two properties for the docs?

```
GatewaysPubkey                               |(string)
RewardsCCassets                              |(string)
```


[07-Nov-18 12:32 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Also, @jl777c in the `tokentransfer` method docs that I started with, there is something that I'm not sure how to identify.

https://siddhartha-komodo.github.io/slate/#tokentransfer

Look in the examples on the right. In Step 3, you'll see this text:

```
vin.0: normal input
vin.1 to vin.n-1: valid CC outputs
vout.0 to n-2: assetoshis output to CC
vout.n-2: normal output for change (if any)
vout.n-1: opreturn [EVAL_ASSETS] ['t'] [assetid]
```

I'm not sure what that is or why it's there?


[07-Nov-18 12:33 PM] jl777c#5810
it describes the usage of the vins and vouts, to simplify the CC validation


[07-Nov-18 12:34 PM] jl777c#5810
all the CC rpc calls should have such a description as it is critical that the specific location and amounts are quite critical


[07-Nov-18 12:35 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Hmm, I vaguely get what you're talking about, but not completely. 

Do you mean to say that each of the rpc calls in all of the CC docs we've prepared thus far need me to add this `vin.0...` description?


[07-Nov-18 12:36 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
And where does the developer enter this information?


[07-Nov-18 12:37 PM] jl777c#5810
at the top of each CC .cpp file I have all the vin/vout described


[07-Nov-18 12:38 PM] jl777c#5810
it is quite useful and should be required to be in the source file


[07-Nov-18 12:52 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
so, that's when you're writing a CC smart contract, not when you're just using an existing rpc call, correct?


[07-Nov-18 12:53 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Does this `vin.0...` material need to be in the documentation for a smart-contract user who does not intend to write a template of their own?

If so, then I'm going to leave it out of here, for now. The `Mastering Cryptoconditions` docs that you wrote can have the more technical info?


[07-Nov-18 12:54 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Also, I need a description for these two properties in the `rewardsaddress` method:

```
GatewaysPubkey                               |(string)
RewardsCCassets                              |(string)
```


[07-Nov-18 01:02 PM] jl777c#5810
it might help the advanced coder to debug things, but it doesnt have to be in the easy guide


[07-Nov-18 01:13 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok.

And the descriptions for those two properties?


[07-Nov-18 01:24 PM] jl777c#5810
GatewaysPubkey is the pubkey for the gateways CC


[07-Nov-18 01:24 PM] jl777c#5810
RewardsCCassets is not important, can be ignored


[07-Nov-18 01:42 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok thanks


[07-Nov-18 02:39 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@jl777c 

In the oracles documentation, in the `oraclesdata` method, there's this:

```
  Have to set string length in the beginning bytes of the hexstring (`hexstr`)
```

What is this referring to?


[07-Nov-18 08:51 PM] jl777c#5810
how long is a string?


[07-Nov-18 08:51 PM] jl777c#5810
that length needs to be encoded in the data


[07-Nov-18 08:54 PM] Alright#0419
@Bryan_Beus I can help you understand what that means, just message me


[07-Nov-18 08:54 PM] Alright#0419
best to just show you examples


[08-Nov-18 02:20 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@jl777c 

I'm noticing that there can be more consistency between rpc calls in the manner that arguments are accepted.

For example, `oraclescreate` appears to take the oracle string name as `"name"` (with quotations), while `rewardscreatefunding` takes the string name as `name`.

I can probably make a list of inconsistencies at some point and put together a style guide. 

Is this something that would be useful?


[08-Nov-18 02:22 PM] jl777c#5810
all CC rpc args are strings


[08-Nov-18 02:22 PM] jl777c#5810
the "" are only needed if you have spaces in the field


[08-Nov-18 03:38 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok


[08-Nov-18 03:54 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Can someone please give me an example of how the `oraclesdata` call uses the `hexstr` property?

In the current example, I see that `hexstr` is entered like this: `00000000ffffffff`

Is the idea that for however many string characters you're going to use, you put that many 0's in front of it?

What are the `f`'s, also? Is this just random data?


[09-Nov-18 04:21 AM] Mylo#8306
each two chars is a byte.
`00000000ffffffff` is `0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00 0xff 0xff 0xff 0xff`
e.g. if you do an `ifconfig` in linux, the HWaddr in my machine's output is `02:42:88:39:4f:cc` - if it was going to be used in `hexstr` it would just be `024288394fcc` & it should be the same as `024288394FCC` (lower/upper case) are just representing hex values 0-9a-fA-F


[09-Nov-18 04:23 AM] Mylo#8306
yes, that `00000000ffffffff ` is just random data.

for some reason there is a space between them in this output, which you would omit for `hexstr`


[09-Nov-18 04:27 AM] Mylo#8306
looks like adding another pipe with ` sed 's/ *//g'` fixes the spacing

I have not. Too many docs to write.

I should be done this week.

I don't think Steve wants us focusing on that, though. We need competitive analysis information, so we'll likely be putting our energy into looking at how it compares to build on Komodo vs other platforms. 

I would like to be involved with building on Vue. I'm reading through textbooks in all my free time on Vue. But I'm not sure it's what Komodo needs at the mo.


[13-Nov-18 04:08 AM] Mylo#8306
@gcharang only tested.  has not been focussed for continuing atm.   But can do so this week.   Just point form outline will work for now (for next few days) until vuepress sorted out.

there was a rough outline on pad.supernet.org/udemy but it is currently offline.  it had 5 ppl contribute so wasn't "one" complete journey.

@Mylo @gcharang 

Are you around? We need to hop on a call with Steve and discuss a few things.


[13-Nov-18 02:59 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@gcharang 

I am almost finished with the documentation.

If you would like to help, I would very much appreciate it.

I need you to read through it from start to finish and look for errors.

I need you also to test each call and make sure that all information about it is correct.

So, we need to make sure that its description is accurate, that its arguments and responses are accurate, and that the examples in the right column of the browser look accurate.

Is this something that you have room on your plate to do? It may be time consuming.

I am now porting all the docs over to vuepress. It seems to be going well. Vuepress does essentially everything Slate can do, and it is also more flexible. 

How are you getting along with cleaning up all of the Slate docs? Have you been able to move through them and test/verify their accuracy?

I'm wondering what the best way will be for you and me and get all your upcoming modifications into the new vuepress docs.


[21-Nov-18 11:52 PM] gcharang#6833
So, do we leave some part of it in slate (like the Komodo-API + CC RPC) or we port everything to vuepress?

[22-Nov-18 12:04 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm pushing everything to vuepress as fast as possible.

I still need you to look for human error, so please do.

Steve is breaking down the general concepts and use cases, making some diagrams, and prepping for more advanced documentation. You should check in with him.

But we hope to have the vuepress stuff ready to push to the website a.s.a.p.!

We will have direct competition in the dPoW space within a few weeks, and we have yet to have  a sales team start hitting up conferences.


[22-Nov-18 12:05 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@gcharang 

Ya, I know about those issues. There's lots of adjustments still to make. This is just internal-only for now. Today I used scripts and node.js to automate transferring over the large chunks of formatting. I'll see if I can write scripts to fix the links, but it's so customized, it may wind up being grunt work.


[22-Nov-18 12:07 AM] gcharang#6833
I can clean all those up. I will clone your vuepress repo and submit pull requests there.
We can track changes only on this repo. it can get confusing to submit anything to the slate repo as work on this has already started


[22-Nov-18 12:09 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ok. How far did you get into the Slate repo?


[22-Nov-18 12:10 AM] gcharang#6833
I have just been reading through it from start to end. I just read through the intro


[22-Nov-18 12:10 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok


[22-Nov-18 12:16 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Let me know how the clean up stuff works.

Keep in mind, you'll only have a few days to get it done. We would like to have a version of the streamlined and targeted documentation available on the main komodo website as soon as possible. If we can be in the process of getting it up by Monday/Tuesday, that would be ideal. I'll be re-writing a lot of the text to account for the changed format and looking to see if I can customize the template so its style is more inline with our current website.

Steve is working on a breakdown of the general components a developer needs to understand so as to be able to envision the creative opportunities available. That's going to inform the layout of the home page and the order of content, and the content itself, in the sidebar. 

We're also going to try to throw in just a few diagrams, if we get time at the end, but that's a hard to reach goal.

@Bryan_Beus have you written a script to add all the files to config.js or did it manually?


[22-Nov-18 03:30 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Manually. It's not worth writing a script. Only write scripts for big stuff.


[22-Nov-18 03:40 AM] gcharang#6833
Got it. Check the PRs I submitted. I wrote a script that cleansup the file names


[22-Nov-18 08:53 AM] gcharang#6833
I have added a readme describing setup. Added links to the nav bar at the top for Dev Journeys. Added a multiple side-bar proof of concept. Please check the PR @Bryan_Beus . I will add docker support next. Regarding accuracy of docs, we can go through them after the structure and dev-jorneys have been finalised.


[22-Nov-18 08:56 AM] gcharang#6833
I propose we use 
* Komodo based Independent chain (KIC) for asset chains
* CC based contracts instead of SmartContracts 
How can we come to a consensus regarding these terms?


[22-Nov-18 09:20 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Thank you.

For the terms, talk with steve. Those are his territory. I haven't gone back to adjust language yet on anything.

@gcharang are you around right now?


[23-Nov-18 06:17 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Thank you for your PR. I'm trying to work with it right now, and am running into many conflicts.

For example, while I may go back and change the filenames right before deploying (and am quite likely to), I need the files showing up in the correct order while I'm working on them. 

The sequence of files should not be haphazard, but should be designed to lead a developer from start to finish. 

Otherwise, we'll end up going back to the disorderly documentation that we have on docs.komodoplatform.com right now.

Does that make sense?


[23-Nov-18 06:18 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
In your PR, all of your requests are lumped into one commit, so I can't wholesale approve it. And I'm not familiar enough with Git to be able to go through your changes one by one locally and accept or reject them.

I just finished updating most of the `examples` formatting, since Slate handles example code differently.

Take a look on the repo.

I haven't checked the Start Here or Basic Instructions sections yet, though. Might have more changes there.

What's really weird is that if I disable various links in the `config.js` file, they are disabled remotely.

So, the `gh-pages` repo is definitely updating and the cache is refreshing, but the browser refresh button causes some other kind of error.

If you can take a look at the repo:

https://siddhartha-komodo.github.io/komodo-docs-vuepress/

and try and help us figure out what's wrong.

It works locally perfectly fine. 

When you push it to the remote site, it will work so long as you only click on sidebar links, but if you hit the refresh button, it dies.

@gcharang: There are still those internal Slate links that we haven't fixed yet. I wonder if this is related to the issue...

@gcharang 

Are you around right now?

I seem to have it kind of working again. I'm not sure what I did to change it.

I removed the `_` from the beginning of the filenames, which was leftover from Slate.

And then I added back a few things one at a time. It's all working on chromium for the moment, but not on firefox.


[24-Nov-18 01:02 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Anyway, I'm going through links one-by-one and updating them.

It is very tedious and time-consuming. I don't believe that it will be faster to script it using node.js, due to the nature of the task. So, it looks like it's all manual.

If you have time to help, that would be great. 

Once we've checked over every link, hopefully it should resolve whatever issue that was. 

Vuepress seems to be a bit tempermental.

@Bryan_Beus is it Ok for the directories 000-start-heer, ...cryptoconditions, ...essential-rpc , ...installations be inside another directory like intro/ . This is so that multiple sidebars are possible.
So my proposed structure will be   /komodo-docs-vuepress/docs/intro/000-start-here   instead of    /komodo-docs-vuepress/docs/000-start-here  the encompassing directory name can be something other than `intro` too

Theoretically yes. Steve is working on layouts for info, so please check in with him.


[24-Nov-18 11:34 PM] gcharang#6833
Ok. This name is just a placeholder. It can be changed to something else later. The main thing I need right now is to put those four directories into a single one, if thats Ok with you, I can proceed

The PR flow sounds fine. Thank you for your PR.

As for multiple sidebars:

If you mean just to change it internally and in the links, but not in the visual appearance, and there will be no new content for me to write/edit, then I am okay with restructuring the directories, and I can do that when I come back on monday.


[25-Nov-18 04:39 AM] gcharang#6833
Multiple sidebars mean, there will be different side bar when looking at different content. You can see how it looks/functions if you go to https://gcharang.github.io/komodo-docs-vuepress/ and click the tab that says "Block chain starterkit" in the navbar at the top. I have already submitted a PR that implements this change. Other than reorging directory structure as mentioned above, it doen't affect your work in any other way

@Bryan_Beus Check the PR: https://github.com/siddhartha-komodo/komodo-docs-vuepress/pull/3
 After adding all the directories you have been working on inside another directory called `intro` all the internal links were broken (they were all absolute links). So I updated them all into relative links. They will now stay correct even if the directory name `intro` is changed. They would only need to be changed when we change the file names and the names of the four folders you've created to remove the numbers.

The script you added in `deploy.sh` to grab the global username and set it as the base repository stopped working after merging all of our additions. I've temporarily disabled it and reset to my username, as I don't have time at the moment to solve this problem. We can come back to this later, as it will be a better solution, once we get it stable.

@SHossain 

In the docs, I currently am indicating `komodo-cli` like this:

```
komodo-cli dumpprivkey "RTcwYaQPDVN7V9SdfFHARWnoB7vcpSfdvs"
```

But I feel like you've told me to do it differently...

Did you want me to do it like this `./komodo-cli`:

```
./komodo-cli dumpprivkey "RTcwYaQPDVN7V9SdfFHARWnoB7vcpSfdvs"
```


[26-Nov-18 06:33 PM] DG#6934
that's the correct input ./komodo-cli


[26-Nov-18 08:31 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I know, but in the docs we ha e it the other way currently, in my docs and on docs.komodoplatform.com


[27-Nov-18 12:47 AM] Mylo#8306
`komodo-cli` would be my preference.
However in the install instructions, https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/install-Komodo-manually.html#installing-komodo-on-ubuntu-debian there is no place that says to link or copy the binary to the $PATH so it's executable by `komodo-cli`.   Therefore, `./komodo-cli` or `./src/komodo-cli` would be the correct way according to the install instructions.

So whatever way is chosen, the two must agree with each other:
1) Our suggested install instructions
2) Command to execute

I think updating the install instructions is necessary.


[27-Nov-18 04:06 AM] SHossain#0007
@Bryan_Beus `./komodo-cli` is preferred. users  can only use `komodo-cli` if they installed it system-wide (requires extra steps)

`./` uses absolute location of the binary. a  developer may compile few different version of binaries from different branch. using `komodod` globally will start only 1 branch and the tests may get malformed

[27-Nov-18 09:16 AM] gcharang#6833
@Bryan_Beus check the PR:https://github.com/siddhartha-komodo/komodo-docs-vuepress/pull/4

The docs edited here and especially the cc-overview need to be modified based on the new smart-contract terminology. if we publish this site like this, these terms like cryptoconditions and assetchains are going to stick even more

I have gone through the docs in the folder `start-here` today. Will continue on to the remaining ones tomorrow.

yes we need to get naming finalized from marketing before going live.
there are other terms in there that need removal imo, e.g. "elementary rpc commands" and "essential rpc commands" are just "rpc commands" no need to add words that provide no extra substance and compounded for developers that are not native english speakers.

@Mylo  please check the post in CFT-dev-resources. Have you talked with @Bryan_Beus  since our chat yesterday re: when to take the site online. I think there is some miscommunication among us  re: in what state the initial dev-portal should be when uploaded. Marketing , @Audo and us need to have a meeting regarding this and the terminology

Initial dev-portal is a long way away. 

We're just talking about putting streamlined docs online this week, nothing more.


[27-Nov-18 08:33 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
There's some discussion about how that will relate to the dev portal, but at the end of today's meeting (after everyone else left), Steve and I agreed that we should just make a temporary decision about a subdirectory for the docs, and we'll deal with the full dev portal later.

In the pr, on all these commands where you're deleting the argument formatting, will the call work if you don't format it this way? I don't remember.

If the formatting is optional, should we include both an Arguments format that has the full call formatting, and then one that has the reduced option?

@gcharang  Notice that there's a few `===` symbols in the `blockchain.md` file.

So there are no rpcuser and pass that came into the commits?


[29-Nov-18 06:52 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
In this file:

`docs/basic-docs/essential-rpc/mining.md`

Line 15:

`The block height.  If not provided, defaults to the current height of the chain.`

I changed it to this:

`the block height; if the block height is not provided, the method defaults to the current height of the chain`

This keeps it stylistically inline with other decisions.

I try to write (almost) complete sentences in the descriptions, with a few exceptions:

rarely do I use a capital letter for the first letter

I try to use a `;`, if at all possible, instead of a sentence break

I don't use incomplete "voice" in the sentence structure, i.e. "if not provided" => "if the block height is not provided"

I don't end with a period, unless absolutely necessary.

Those are just stylistic decisions that I made early on, given the context and visual presentation.

I'm seeing many instances in the docs where we need to correct the descriptions for stylistic matching.

Another example is in "This must be set to "template" or omitted".

I fixed that one, but I see a few more.

Can you please go through your work and look for these style issues?

Also, I saw a typo in `getspentinfo`. There's a space ` ` missing between two sentences.

I took a look through the cakeshop docs. 

I also like the idea of a best practices.

If we were to add in anything else, though, I would like it to be with separate sidebars.

In theory, imo, we want super clean docs, where there's almost as much white space as there is text, and where the dev only sees what they're actually looking for, and nothing more.

What do you think?

I need some time to clean up my computer, though, if you don't mind. Over the last few months of blitzing to get these docs finished and online, I've created a total mess and need to get organized. 
Cleaning it up shouldn't take too long, then I can start in on this.

Keep me posted on how the dev portal research is going. I'm really looking forward to working on it.

I think a custom theme for our docs is inevitable. We want a dark-theme, and I haven't found any default options for that.


[29-Nov-18 07:16 PM] Mylo#8306
@Bryan_Beus multiple sidebars very necessary for whitespace etc.   too much capability in komodo, definitely needs separating.   also barterdex will have it's own doc centre, no point cramming it into the one lot of docs, and i can imagine each developer journey could be a separate docs repo.  they just share the same navbar config.

Re: the phrase, "However, coins may not be transferred between blockchains. So, these are not fungible chains."

For writing style, it's generally best to avoid starting a sentence with "So, ..."

That's fine for texting your girlfriend, but not for professional docs. 

I suggest changing it to this:

`However, coins are not fungible, and therefore cannot be transferred between blockchains.`

@gcharang 

From your commit:

`On an `ac_staked` asset chain there are 64 global segments (`segid`'s) to which all addresses (by extension utxos) belong, and these 64 `segid`'s get turns to stake blocks.`

We want to generally avoid putting things in parantheses. It making one's writing voice sound like you can't keep a coherent train of thought. Sometimes they are required to get the idea across however, but this doesn't seem to be one of those situations. When you do need to use parantheses, try to put them off to the side of the main thought, and only after you've finished the main thought.

The work `get` is also to be used sparingly.

See if you can rewrite that section to take those things into account.

I use the articles `a` and `the` in the documentation, where appropriate.

In the descriptions of properties, I am using articles.

This prevents the documentation from sounding like it's been put together in a rush.

`"depends"                                    |(array)                      |an array of numbers`

Can you please go back and add in articles in all of your new descriptions and materials?


[29-Nov-18 08:17 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
In this addition here:

`"mutable"                                    |(array of string)            |list of ways the block template may be changed`

the `(array of string)` is not clear. 

I originally left in the structure of the objects in the arguments and responses.

So, all the `[`, `{` and `,`'s were there so that the user could see what the structure would be. I noticed you've been deleting that from the docs, and I can understand that this may be an atistic license decision, so I've just been confirming them.

But if it's going to make descriptions more confusing, perhaps we should just leave the structure of the objects in place? 

I was trying to keep the `type` column limited to just a few options, to make things simpler. Once you start making propertis in this column more than one-word descriptions, it gets confusing real fast, which takes away the value of the column and makes the documents harder to use.

What do you think?

" And the terms are there in the example when they see the word, they can loook at the table for explanation"

Can you explain this more, please?


[29-Nov-18 08:22 PM] gcharang#6833
I mean when they look at the example command, they can see where the term in the table is, then see its explanation


[29-Nov-18 08:23 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
"The { [ etc., weren't really helpful imo."

I disagree, but I'm willing to compromise and do this your way. 

The point is, however, that when you remove the structure of the response, all of a sudden the burden to explain ourselves in the `type` column increases.

The documentation that we had previously from Zcash was a mess here, and I left the structure in on purpose to alleviate much of the confusion and stylistic mismatches.

It's best to keep the `type` column to one-word descriptions, but when you take away the structure, then you have to explain which property is an array/object/etc.

And the `(array of string)` is grammatically unclear.

Does that make sensee?


[29-Nov-18 08:23 PM] gcharang#6833
Yes. Editing now


[29-Nov-18 08:24 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
"I mean when they look at the example command, they can see where the term in the table is, then see its explanation"

We want to avoid forcing the developer to look at the examples. The examples are there as a backup, to help where the Arguments and Responses are unclear. We don't want to create total dependency on the examples for the documentation.


[29-Nov-18 08:26 PM] gcharang#6833
Then we could have had the explanation in the same json format/ command format as in the help output.

We can have the same thing in documentation right, with tables, the brackets look bad


[29-Nov-18 08:32 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
The old format is awful, we agree on that.

But the structure of the Argument and Response is important. 

Having all of the object and array signs in place helps the developer know how to properly structure their argument.

I disagree with the notion that they look out of place. They provide meaningful information to the developer, and the fact that the table is a cleaner presentation format doesn't make the object symbols any less useful.

I would prefer that we go back and add them in, but it's an artistic license decision, and I'm willing to compromise if you feel strongly about this.

If you would like to remove them, you'll need to make sure that the Type column gives the missing information, and this is going to be difficult, because it turns the type column in to a much longer description, and it may be difficult to get professional sounding grammar into that spot.

You choose. Just make sure to be 100% consistent throughout the docs.


[29-Nov-18 08:36 PM] gcharang#6833
You really think this looks professional, and the bracket structure is comprehensible?

If I could include identations, it would help, but the theme doesn't allow that.

Otherwise, yes, I think it's fine.

It's an artistic license decision, as I've already mentioned.

Again, if you feel strongly about this, I'm willing to compromise, but you will need to increase the quality of information in the Type column.


[29-Nov-18 08:39 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
The missing "transactions" and "depends" descriptions do need to be filled in, in the above example.


[29-Nov-18 08:39 PM] gcharang#6833
I mean there is no starting square bracket in the above table, but there is an ending one. It just looked confusing to me. So I started removing them


[29-Nov-18 08:40 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Those are typos.


[29-Nov-18 08:40 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Which is what we need fixing -- i.e. the human error I keep asking to be fixed.

The typos are a separate matter from whether or not the format is useful.


[29-Nov-18 08:41 PM] gcharang#6833
> The missing "transactions" and "depends" descriptions do need to be filled in, in the above example.
I added them in the yesterdays commits


[29-Nov-18 08:42 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Okay, great.


[29-Nov-18 08:43 PM] gcharang#6833
What do you suggest we add in the type column if we remove the brackets


[29-Nov-18 08:44 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Where appropriate, you will need to indicate if the property is an array and/or object, etc., in addition to the existing common types currently in use.

And we don't want the Type column to become wordy, so you're giving yourself a challenge if this is the route that you want to go.


[29-Nov-18 08:46 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
If I had time, using the format that includes the `{}` `[]` and `,` information, I would also make sure that each time there's an array or object that can include multiple responses, the `,` would be there to show that.

It was one of the things I just didn't have time to address. I was hoping that you would look it over while looking for my own errors.

However, if you want to remove everything that shows the structure of the response/argument, it will be up to you to indicate it, where it's necessary.


[29-Nov-18 08:48 PM] gcharang#6833
Ok. Hold off on merging the PR. I will add the changes we just discussed.


[29-Nov-18 08:48 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442

doesn't preformatted stuff keep indentation?

If you mean stuff like this that comes out of komodo-cli help output:
```

  "confirmations" : n,       (numeric) The number of confirmations

"scriptPubKey" : {         (json object)

 "addresses" : [          (array of string) array of Zcash addresses

},
"version" : n,              (numeric) The version
"coinbase" : true|false     (boolean) Coinbase or not

It will keep the indentation

working on your PR now, @gcharang


[03-Dec-18 03:04 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
So far so good, gcharang. 

I've found a workaround for making changes locally, so that helps a lot.

Here's one question:

```
number                                       |(numeric)                    |the transactions before this one (by 1-based index in "transactions" list) that must be present in the final block, if this one is
```

The description is a little unclear, and it also has parantheses in the middle of the thought.

Can you try rewriting this so that the meaning is more clear and any side information is given afterwards, and preferrably in a proper sentence instead of parens?


[03-Dec-18 03:07 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Here is another such case, also in the `mining.md` file. Can you please work on the phrasing and remove the need for parentheses?

```
|the priority to add or subtract (the transaction selection algorithm assigns the tx a higher priority; (transaction priority calculation: `coinage * value_in_satoshis / txsize`))
```


[03-Dec-18 03:08 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Another case:

```
only the algorithm for selecting transactions into a block considers the transaction as it paid a higher (or lower) fee.
```


[03-Dec-18 03:16 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
The `gettransaction` method in the `wallet.md` file has a few arrays that need a bit more description in the `type` column. Can you please take a look at that?


[03-Dec-18 03:24 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Another thing to address.

In this sentence here:

```
They all form a cluster with the same N value where the base tokens in all the chains in that cluster are fungible via the burn protocol.
```

Who is "they"? Is it the notary nodes? The pubkeys? The asset chains? Need to be specific.

I rewrote to this:

```
All asset chains that has the same `ac_cc` value form a cluster, where the base tokens of all the chains in the cluster are fungible via the burn protocol.
```


[03-Dec-18 03:26 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm putting all of these notes in an issue so they're easier to track.


[03-Dec-18 03:28 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I made a few more edits and pushed them to the dev branch.

If you have time, it might be useful to do a `git diff` between your PR and the commit I just pushed to `dev`. It shows a few additional grammar considerations we can consider.

Good work.

I'm working through an issue that Tony posted on GitHub.

https://github.com/siddhartha-komodo/komodo-docs-vuepress/issues/10

Open the link that he has there and scroll over to the comments column in the document.

He has many comments pointed out that need work. Some are entirely new and are not yet in the docs. Others he has indicated as being behind the current state, but these calls have already been documented in our VuePress release (for example, `kvupdate`).

Can you please work through these calls and put together information for the new rpc calls, keeping the same writing style that we have throughout our docs?

I will check them over after and make sure that the writing and format are consistent. 

let me know if you can do this, please.

It's still not clear what this means:

```
if this transaction is present in the final block, the indices of transactions that must be present before it in the final block; the index of the array of transactions starts with "1" 
```


[04-Dec-18 12:23 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
One thing to keep in mind:

While `indices` is techinically a word, most people don't know it. `indexes` is an equivalent word, and is easier to read. Use that instead.

I still don't follow what the meaning of the sentence is above. Do you have source material I can review? A comment from a developer that we can try to dissect?


For priority_delta:
```
the priority to add or subtract (if negative); the transaction selection algorithm assigns the tx a higher or lower (if negative) priority; transaction priority calculation: `coinage * value_in_satoshis / txsize`
```

Here's a suggestion:

```
the priority to add or subtract (if negative). The transaction selection algorithm assigns the transaction a higher or lower priority. The transaction priority calculation equation: `coinage * value_in_satoshis / txsize`
```

Because it's such a long sentence, I broke it out into full sentences.

Notice that I kept the first letter of the description uncapitalized -- this keeps it from standing out in the docs when lined up against others. It may not work visually, once we see it in place.

re:
```

```
its for a property called `depends:` for one of the transactions in a proposed block for the network.  This property is an array that lists the numbers of all the other transactions that are still unconfirmed that should be in the block before this transaction if this transaction is to be included and the index of the array named transaction starts with "1"

-All this is assuming that the dApp only processes one transaction per ride, per customer. If the dApp is instead a game that has a looping function, the gas fees can grow even more absurd, and the blockchain itself can crash as it attempts to constantly operate at 100% capacity.

"the blockchain itself can crash as it attempts to constantly operate at 100% capacity" doesn't make sense

However, if you are working within the daemon, we currently recommend that you have a considerable amount of programming experience, and that you work primarily in C/C++. These are the native languages of the Komodo daemon. When making adjustments to your coin's daemon, other languages can be supported, depending on the circumstances. It may incur an additional cost. Please reach out to our team with your questions.

I was looking through that GitHub documentation I found. 

It has a link to a live demo here, and it is very helpful.

Next up is the Vuetify stuff.

great, let me take a look


[05-Dec-18 01:43 AM] gcharang#6833
For the name change essential-rpc to komodo-api, do you have a script?


[05-Dec-18 01:43 AM] gcharang#6833
If not I can have it done in 5 minutes

```
.The transaction priority calculation: `coinage * value_in_satoshis / txsize`

Missing a space between the period and `The`.

Can you fix real quick please?


[05-Dec-18 01:44 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Easier on your end.


[05-Dec-18 01:45 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I wrote a partial script for name changes, but it was only applicable in that one circumstance...

It's in the `play` subdirectory... Not sure if it would work here.


[05-Dec-18 01:45 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Give me a sec.


[05-Dec-18 01:47 AM] gcharang#6833
Does the script work only for config.js or can it go through all the folders and fix internal links?


[05-Dec-18 01:48 AM] gcharang#6833
If it can't deal with internal links in other folders, I can do it quickly with find + replace

[05-Dec-18 01:49 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
The script might help, and might not. 

It's primarily targeted for use cases where you need to rename many things in the file, not just one phrase.

Where you're just trying to rename one file, I think it's not going to make it any faster than just doing Find/Replace in each file.

The reason I wrote the script was because I had to do about 20 Find/Replace commands in each file, so it was safer to script than not to script.


[05-Dec-18 01:50 AM] gcharang#6833
Cool. Will do it and ping you


[05-Dec-18 01:50 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
The script doesn't overwrite existing files.


[05-Dec-18 01:50 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ok.


[05-Dec-18 01:51 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
The script returns the output to a separate .txt file, which I then skimmed over to make sure nothing had gone terribly wrong, and then I manually overwrote final file.

If this becomes a frequent event, I can add some logic to the script to pause for a checkover, and then it will notify us of which files will be overwritten, and then overwrite the file...

It wouldn't take too long, so let's just see what happens.


[05-Dec-18 01:52 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Once you're done with the file renaming, we are good to push everything to the new repo.

Thank you for your great teamwork.

For now, it's still just to the subdir.

@SHossain 

Do we have a repo available on the KomodoPlatform organization now?


[05-Dec-18 02:13 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
If so, can you please make the both of us contributors?

Alternatively... you could possibly just fork the repo from my account.


[05-Dec-18 02:13 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
That might be easier, and then give us both access to that...


[05-Dec-18 02:14 AM] gcharang#6833
It might be better to clone and upload as a new project instead of forking. Github has some weird rules about deletion of upstream deletes fork or sth like that


[05-Dec-18 02:14 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ok, that's a good point.


[05-Dec-18 02:15 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@SHossain Let us know when we have a repo available.

For now, we can consider the streamlined documentation projects finished, with the exception of checking with Steve about the cost statements. 

On to the next event! Thank you, @gcharang. You are a great co-worker. Keep up the good work.

We talked about that. The problem is that I worry about what might happen if we don't alter the .git, or node_modules, or other files corrwctly. It could cause more errors.

Seems best to start fresh.

@Bryan_Beus not sure about enhance-app.js capabilities.
However for your mobile image scaling issue, can be done towards the end of this page, "Custom Themes" section (don't be fooled by the heading), and under it "Basic Modifications".    using `.vuepress/override.styl` you can make the mods necessary for the hero image to scale properly


[05-Dec-18 07:10 AM] Mylo#8306
just change a colour first, make sure you're on the right track.


[05-Dec-18 07:10 AM] Mylo#8306
i'll test the image resize tomorrow unless you happen to fix it by then.


[05-Dec-18 07:13 AM] Mylo#8306
you might need to use another instance of your repo to `eject` the theme to see current css classes and stuff in stylus (the css framework)

I've pushed the update to the dev branch, but not to master.

We need to decide on a release methodology.


[06-Dec-18 01:26 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I was thinking that, under normal circumstances, we could push to master and deploy to gh-pages once a week, or something, for the time being. 

What do you think?


[06-Dec-18 01:27 AM] gcharang#6833
I can setup automated build such that, whenever a commit is pushed to master, it will get deployed automatically to gh-pages . We won't use the deploy script again. What do you think?
(This is so that we don't accidentally deploy in dev versions that might be broken)


[06-Dec-18 01:28 AM] gcharang#6833

Good work! I'm going through your changes and have a few questions.

You switched "Essential RPC Calls" to "Komodo API". Can you tell me what the thought is behind this?


[14-Dec-18 12:49 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Next question: in crosschain.md, I see a lot of incomplete additions.

I'm assuming the file is not intended to be active yet, in the docs?


[14-Dec-18 02:49 AM] gcharang#6833
>  "Essential RPC Calls" to "Komodo API"
because the section is just all of komodo api. Essential RPC might give the impression that there are others that had been leftout. Also other coins' docs call them API, I remember mylo suggesting this change too

>crosschain.md
haven't added to config.js so it should be inaccessible

Quick Q if a developer wants to implement CC to their website or application...the developer portal...is where they should pointed to right?


[17-Dec-18 11:48 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@DG Mylo can probably answer that question.

@gcharang 

I should have a little time available here soon, and can help with the docs, if you need anything.

Is there anything that you would like help on? Adding another document or series of documents? Let me know, otherwise I'll keep working on some of the Vue.js stuff we're putting together.


[18-Dec-18 12:15 AM] Mylo#8306
Yes, i think we dealt with it in riot chat.   But i'll address it in this week's tech tuesday as well.


[18-Dec-18 12:32 AM] gcharang#6833
@Bryan_Beus  I am going through the cc folder in the docs site. I just need you to check the PR once I  am done with it.


[18-Dec-18 01:09 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok, sounds good. hit me up when you are ready.


[18-Dec-18 01:37 AM] Mihailo#5902
@Bryan_Beus I stumbled yesterday on docs for gateways as I needed to see something and figured out that the doc is corrupted little bit. The part of bind is missing and maybe some more.

Oh great. Let me fix that real quick.


[18-Dec-18 01:38 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
What specifically is corrupted?


[18-Dec-18 01:38 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Oh, this is the Gateways CC...

@TonyL Can you please take a look at what @Mihailo is referring to and let me know?


[18-Dec-18 01:39 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Mihailo 

Tony did a lot of work on Gateways, and I just put it into a stylized format. I've never actually used Gateways, so if you can point out to me what's wrong, that would help.


[18-Dec-18 01:39 AM] Mihailo#5902
Just above this chapter should be the part with gateway bind that is not completley there: https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/cryptoconditions/cc-gateways.html#assemble-the-dapp

@Bryan_Beus Yes!


[18-Dec-18 01:42 AM] Mihailo#5902
@Bryan_Beus It could also be easier if you can send me the repo for future corrections so I can fix them on the go if I notice something small.

@Bryan_Beus "internal address not related to usage of faucet " should be "internal address not related to usage of dice ". Sorry I copy pasted from the faucet doc and forgot to edit it for dice

@Mylo @Bryan_Beus regarding this issue: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/developer-docs/issues/5 it seems like the feature is not available through vuepress directly. It will require a new component.
This looks like a component that does this: https://github.com/feathers-plus/generator-feathers-plus/tree/master/docs/.vuepress/components
Can one of you guys check it out and adapt it for our docs?

[21-Jan-19 04:11 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
the stuff in src/assets/scss isn't too informative

there are some sass variables in vendors/chart.js/


[21-Jan-19 04:13 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
the stuff in src/assets/scss doesn't actually give any details, at least, not that I've seen yet.

It's just stuff for customization and overrides.

I'm looking for their main css hub, but don't want to change things in the wrong place. 

Will keep poking. Not to worry. 

I'll also see about finding where their active communities are.


[21-Jan-19 04:16 PM] Mylo#8306
in dev tools, pick something you want to change, like background hover on navbar, it's something like `.sidebar .nav-dropdown.open .nav-link` & `.sidebar .nav-link:hover`


[21-Jan-19 04:19 PM] Mylo#8306
it's default with dark theme is `background: #20a8d8` colour, a kind of blue.   change it to `background: pink`


[21-Jan-19 04:19 PM] Mylo#8306
to get it in dev tools, click on something like Special Nodes -> Email Integration (actually click it) and it will show up

and then look in `node_modules/@coreui/coreui-pro/scss` because the project's scss files refer to `@import "~@coreui/coreui-pro/scss/themes/dark/coreui-dark";` for the dark theme, or if you're looking at the free public one

ahh, that's probably what I want


[21-Jan-19 04:27 PM] Mylo#8306
and then whatever they've called variables in their node_modules stuff, you override it in the `custom` file


[21-Jan-19 04:27 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
right


[21-Jan-19 04:27 PM] Mylo#8306
would be my first guess....then you just wrestle a bit with how they've rigged it up


[21-Jan-19 04:28 PM] Mylo#8306

[21-Jan-19 04:29 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
looks like _variables.scss has the most info I've seen so far...


[21-Jan-19 04:29 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
in node modules


[21-Jan-19 04:33 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
somethings not quite sitting right yet


[21-Jan-19 04:34 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm still new to sass, but as far as I understand, we should avoid changing variables directly...

still just thinking outlout


[21-Jan-19 04:34 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
outloud


[21-Jan-19 04:35 PM] Mylo#8306
probably.   but that's why there's `custom` to override them


[21-Jan-19 04:36 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ya, of course


[21-Jan-19 04:36 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
what I mean is


[21-Jan-19 04:36 PM] Mylo#8306
also if that doesn't work, changing a variable value from blue to pink is fine if that's what the style guide will be for a hover.  it will be uniform across the project.  just depends what the style guide is


[21-Jan-19 04:36 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I can change the variables in src/assets/scss/_variables.scss


[21-Jan-19 04:36 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
but I'm still not sure where everything's getting compiled


[21-Jan-19 04:37 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
the variables are supposed to be called elsewhere.

It's good to be able to see them in the node module, but...hmmm... where are they getting compiled. 

That's the question right now.


[21-Jan-19 04:37 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
everything in the node_module's theme/dark/ folder is just variables


[21-Jan-19 04:38 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
the variables are set here, but where are they actually called, does that make sense?


[21-Jan-19 04:38 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I want to see that file


[21-Jan-19 04:38 PM] Mylo#8306
they get compiled by `npm` script.   vue project uses webpack, and in webpack there's a loader that loads scss files and compiles them to css.   all smoke and mirrors behind the scenes


[21-Jan-19 04:39 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
hmm...


[21-Jan-19 04:39 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
do you know where that script is? package.json?


[21-Jan-19 04:40 PM] Mylo#8306
the loader in webpack gets configured.    for vue projects, the loader loads .vue files.  the vue-loader is configured to take vue files, split them apart from the template, script and style section and compile them into one huge chunk of js & css.   same with sass/scss.   webpack loader takes the nice to read src, and compiles it to one huge chunk.


[21-Jan-19 04:40 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
My rudimentary understanding of sass is that you set the variable, but you still have to call it later.

Sass shouldn't (?) compile any variable until it's been called. ?

Else, wouldn't every variable get called?


[21-Jan-19 04:40 PM] Mylo#8306
webpack


[21-Jan-19 04:40 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok, let me digest that.


[21-Jan-19 04:41 PM] Mylo#8306
yeah it's a tough one.  webpack is gulp etc. on steriods.   it's a nightmare too.


[21-Jan-19 04:41 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
so, it sounds to me like these variables are getting called in vue files, then


[21-Jan-19 04:43 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I don't think the webpack stuff is what I'm looking for. 

I think poking around in the .vue files is what I want to do next.

I can change the colors already, I believe. But I want to know how everything's wired up, and make sure I don't change default values that shouldn't be changed unless it's appropriate. 

I'll look for a community for coreui, too. I bet there's someone who's available for simple questions.

[21-Jan-19 04:56 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I believe I'm correct in thinking that the `public` directory is only for vue to handle, right?

I think that's the way it was with vuepress.


[21-Jan-19 04:59 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I think many of the answers I was looking for are in the src/router folder...
So there's that.

This is different than the projects I've worked on in the past.

I'm assuming it's done this way because it's better than the other options I've seen, will take a minute to get used to.


[21-Jan-19 05:22 PM] Mylo#8306
all good.  as per convo - just run through the commits of existing portal project from bare bones to current mock up.    they are separated out into 8 commits that show the architecture.

Starting point is public/index.html
From here the vue app gets attached to the <div id="app">
And this is where everything in /src/main.js takes over.

main.js is where the Vue instance is instantiated.

The Vue instance pulls in stuff from App.vue
Pulls in /src/router/index.js
Pulls in scss which the last thing to load is assets/scss/style and the last thing pulled into that is custom, so your custom stuff overrides everything as per normal css overriding.

Vue, like react, like any other js front end framework is one giant chained together bunch of good ideas, that is held together by the internet's duct tape - webpack.

@Bryan_Beus @gcharang what is the status of docs vs developers   .komodoplatform.com and where is the portal going to go.    Not sure telling ppl that are used to a workflow at the docs site being deprecated without sufficient info or handover is effective.   Might want to ask marketing for better guidance on what the moves are for the future?


[22-Jan-19 02:19 AM] Mylo#8306
I would just leave docs site continuing as a “handbooks” area until the menu structure of the developers (and it’s lifecycle) will be - does it get auto-deployed?  Does it replace docs in every regard?

I just updated -ac_eras in dev branch.

https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/developer-docs/blob/dev/docs/basic-docs/installations/asset-chain-parameters.md

Can you please take a look and tell me if that is still accurate?

A key difference:

I assumed (hopefully correctly) that since -ac_end can accept multiple values, as per your final example, that -ac_end is also capable of accepting multiple values. 

Take a look and tell me what you think.

I'll keep moving through your other changes tonight and tomorrow.

ac_end determines the end of the era in block height


[22-Jan-19 08:42 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Does that mean that each asset chain must have -ac_end set?

Not each and every assetchain but if you use eras - you have do define the end of each era

@Mylo We will leave docs.kp as it is for now and add docs there that don't fit with the developers.kp site. But whenever a doc is available in developers.kp then it is the actual version and to consider docs.kp version as deprecated. I will add this notice and links to the new site at the top of all the docs that have new versions available.
Is this OK?


[23-Jan-19 04:34 AM] Mylo#8306
Wait til developers or the devportal or whatever is before announcing anything imo.  But sounds like a good plan.
The docs site has excellent “handbook” style notes.  And there’s plenty of Komodo for anyone to learn so I think need some planning where documentation is heading.

I wouldn’t want to say X is deprecated because there’s a lot of X to try and find a new home

[23-Jan-19 09:26 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Alright 

I think there was a typo in the ac_founders section? Look at the example below. It used to say 10 coins. I'm changing it to 0.1 coin, since that's the percentage, is that right?

Thanks
```
The `ac_founders` value determines the frequency at which the founder's reward is paid.

The `ac_perc` value determines the percentage of block rewards paid to the founder.

For example:

```
-ac_reward=100000000 -ac_perc=10000000 -ac_founders=100
```

The above parameters result in mining rewards of 100000000 satoshis (1 coin) per block, with a difference on every 100th block. On the 100th block exception, 10000000 additional satoshis (0.1 coin) are paid to the founder's address.

Use `-ac_pubkey` to send the founder's reward to a normal address. 

Use `-ac_script` to send the founder's reward to a multisig address.
```


[23-Jan-19 09:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
that incorect its 10 coins


[23-Jan-19 09:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
It "saves up " the founders percentage and pays it out in one large sum instead of lots of small ones... whoich is impractical in the real world.

[23-Jan-19 11:24 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Alright  or @Deleted User 

Are either of you around right now to help with the `ac_timelock...` documentation?

I have some questions.

Namely, does `ac_timelockgte` lock a partial amount of the block reward, for later release?


[23-Jan-19 11:25 AM] jl777c#5810
blockrewards >= to ac_timelockgte are timelocked


[23-Jan-19 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
Block reward starts with a linear ramp, changing every block, for the first 10,080 blocks (1 week) going from 0 to the peak reward of 384. From that point forward, block reward will halve monthly for the following 5 months, then every 2 years after that. All block rewards, whether mined or staked, with a reward above or equal to 192 VRSC will be time locked for a random release time between block 129,600 and 1,181,520 (3 months to 2 years and 3 months after genesis). That means they will not be transferable or useful for any purpose until their time lock opens, at which time they will be mature and spendable by the miner or staker who earned them. If you earn these blocks, we hope you will join us and contribute as a stakeholder to the Verus vision.


[23-Jan-19 11:26 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
so, the opposite. the `...gte` amount is distributed, and the remainder is locked, correct?


[23-Jan-19 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
~/VerusCoin/src/komodod -pubkey=$pubkey -ac_name=VRSC -ac_algo=verushash -ac_cc=1 -ac_veruspos=50 -ac_supply=0 -ac_eras=3 -ac_reward=0,38400000000,2400000000 -ac_halving=1,43200,1051920 -ac_decay=100000000,0,0 -ac_end=10080,226080,0 -ac_timelockgte=19200000000 -ac_timeunlockfrom=129600 -ac_timeunlockto=1180800 -addnode=185.25.48.236 -addnode=185.64.105.111 &


[23-Jan-19 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
the entire blockreward is timelocked


[23-Jan-19 11:27 AM] jl777c#5810
the above -ac params implements the VRSC paragraph


[23-Jan-19 11:27 AM] jl777c#5810
understanding the details of the paragraph will help understand the various -ac params


[23-Jan-19 11:28 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ok, so if the block reward is less than gte, it is distributed. If not, it is locked until the random release time.


[23-Jan-19 11:31 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[23-Jan-19 11:31 AM] jl777c#5810
the verus ac options were implemented specifically to have the verus emissions described in the paragraph


[23-Jan-19 11:38 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Are these random disbursements all distributed at once, ecosystem-wide? Or do they all filter out over the given range?


[23-Jan-19 11:43 AM] jl777c#5810
-ac_timeunlockfrom=129600 -ac_timeunlockto=1180800


[23-Jan-19 11:43 AM] jl777c#5810
eack timelocked block unlocks at some random block between timeunlockfrom to timeunlockto


[23-Jan-19 11:43 AM] jl777c#5810
they are not distributed, they are just allowed to be unlocked


[23-Jan-19 11:44 AM] jl777c#5810
All block rewards, whether mined or staked, with a reward above or equal to 192 VRSC will be time locked for a random release time between block 129,600 and 1,181,520 (3 months to 2 years and 3 months after genesis).

[23-Jan-19 11:44 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok


[23-Jan-19 11:57 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
what api command would I execute to ascertain if a given block reward is locked/unlocked?


[23-Jan-19 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
getblock -> find first txid in the array and then getrawtransaction txid 1


[23-Jan-19 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
if the coinbase tx has an opreturn and it is paid to a p2sh address it is locked


[23-Jan-19 12:08 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ok.

I will probably ask @Alright to do an example for this on an existing test chain. Seems useful.


[23-Jan-19 12:08 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Thank you.


[23-Jan-19 12:34 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@jl777c 

In the documentation on `ac_verus`, there is this line:

```
When activated, the chain uses [Verus](http://veruscoin.io/)'s proof of stake implementation instead.
```

I would like to add text that describes `instead of [what?]`. So, I need to say what the normal/default aspect is that is being changed.

Is it the equihash algorithm?

Or is it that when you use `ac_staked`, you're using a PoS method that was built by Komodo, whereas Verus has a different code base?

Thanks.


[23-Jan-19 02:55 PM] Alright#0419
please just test the things you put into assetchains docs or leave it to me to manage


[23-Jan-19 02:56 PM] Alright#0419
do not make assumptions, everything I put into those docs is tested and not based on assumptions


[23-Jan-19 03:06 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
In the writing process, there will always be back and forth, and assumptions made from all parties.

I'm trying to infer from the writings I receive more specific information than what was originally included. 

Afterwards, I head back to the people who know the technical details better than I do, and I ask for verification.

eos are api docs.  for v1 portal & docs remake, api docs like that are not planned.
marketmaker v1 has api docs like that by ca at http://api.kmd.host
marketmaker v2 rustdocs i've got artem's instructions for building.  the promise by rust doc is to look like https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/boxed/index.html

to make a multi-language api doc, we need multi-language libraries.   currently they are in various stages of development by community members, golang, rust, javascript, python, c++.

tron dev portal is the thing that i'm building, yes it will be nice and focussed, like http://portal.paris.businessapps.com.au but with content obv. which i'm working on atm.

All the above can be styled similarly at the end of the day.    IBN and doc team were going to be addressing some UX/style in feb.

first we need to tag all the docs, TT sections & support answers.   Once tagged, we can categorize them into pillars.   Or make pillars and pigeon hole.   We can start doing this in feb as well.

@jl777c 

Alright informs me that ac_ccenable has some quirks that can cause a danger to unsuspecting developers/users. 

Here is how I have written the developers.komodoplatform.com docs to account for this. 

can you please verify/correct?

```
## ac_ccenable

::: warning
This parameter is in its final testing stages. Please reach out to us if you would like to use it on a production chain, as additional steps must be taken by the developer to ensure user safety.
:::

The `ac_ccenable` parameter restricts the asset chain so that only indicated CryptoConditions modules can be enabled. `ac_ccenable` requires [`ac_cc`](../installations/asset-chain-parameters.html#ac-cc) to be active.

To indicate which CryptoConditions modules should be available, insert each module's eval code in decimal and separated by commas. A list of all eval codes can be found [here](https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/master/src/cc/eval.h).

For example, the following parameters create an asset chain where only the `faucet` and `rewards` modules are active:

```
komodod -ac_name=EXAMPLE -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=100000000 -ac_cc=2 -ac_ccenable=228,229
```

When `-ac_cc` is set, but `-ac_ccenable` is not, all CryptoConditions modules are enabled.

`ac_ccenable` disables spending utxos that are created under a non-enabled CryptoConditions module. It does not yet prevent rpc calls from creating utxos that belong to non-enabled modules. Therefore, we highly recommend that this feature not be activated on a default production chain, as improper usage of `ac_ccenable` can result in unspendable utxos. At this time, this danger can be eliminated by manually deactivating all inactive CryptoConditions modules. In the future, if there is sufficient interest, we can automate this task.
```


[05-Feb-19 03:41 PM] Alright#0419
That all looks fine. The danger comes from the rpc commands for the deactivated CCs still being enabled. We're using this for LABS, so we should have a solution to the problem relatively soon


[05-Feb-19 04:25 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok


[05-Feb-19 04:25 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Alright 

Once you have verified the rest of the asset chain docs, I think it's ready to push to master.


[05-Feb-19 04:27 PM] Alright#0419
👌 will get to it today


[05-Feb-19 09:53 PM] jl777c#5810
but you cant prevent sending to any sort of vout


[05-Feb-19 09:53 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure that is even possible as there is no validation step to make sure the vout is spendable. that is how p2sh works, you dont know when sending if it can be spent.


[05-Feb-19 09:54 PM] jl777c#5810
ccenable will mean that only the CC that are listed will be enabled


[05-Feb-19 09:54 PM] jl777c#5810
if you send funds to a CC that is not enabled, those funds will be locked and be unspendable


[05-Feb-19 10:00 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@jl777c 

Hmm, from a technical perspective, I understand what you mean.

What would you recommend saying to developers in the documentation about this?


[05-Feb-19 10:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think we can just disable the RPCs for non enabled CC's ... altough this isnt a easy as it sounds. I think I will be able to come up with a solution given enough time... if jl doesnt do it first


[05-Feb-19 10:04 PM] jl777c#5810
describe what happens accurately


[05-Feb-19 10:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
you cant disable ppl doing the txns ... but you can at elast make it very hard for them to do so


[05-Feb-19 10:05 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, disabling the corresponding RPC sounds like a good idea


[05-Feb-19 10:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
yes... I need to think about how bet to do this but I think its prefectly possible.


[05-Feb-19 10:05 PM] jl777c#5810
if ( CCDISABLE[evalcode] != 0 ) return error, in all the rpc


[05-Feb-19 10:06 PM] jl777c#5810
there is already a CC readiness check function, I will just pass in the evalcode to that and do it in one place. I will do this


[05-Feb-19 10:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
sweet thanks 😃 tht sounds much easier than was I was thinking of


[05-Feb-19 10:08 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
would you like me to wait to push this to master (and thus public)?


[05-Feb-19 10:09 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
or should I rephrase and say something along the lines of, "Please reach out to our team if you would like to use this method..." etc.?


[05-Feb-19 10:10 PM] jl777c#5810
why do they need to reach out?


[05-Feb-19 10:10 PM] jl777c#5810
I already added the fix, so you cant make an unspendable CC vout of disabled CC unless you manually constructed the rawtx, in which case you know what you are doing


[05-Feb-19 10:12 PM] jl777c#5810
also one exception to the rule, if you have ac_cclib specified, then the evalcodes in the libcc.so will not be disabled


[05-Feb-19 10:27 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
oh, cool!


[05-Feb-19 10:27 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
well, that was easy.


[05-Feb-19 10:27 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'll add that note in

`also one exception to the rule, if you have ac_cclib specified, then the evalcodes in the libcc.so will not be disabled`


[05-Feb-19 10:31 PM] Alright#0419
@jl777c which branch is the fix, hadn't noticed it


[05-Feb-19 10:33 PM] jl777c#5810
jl777 branch, just did it, but it doesnt compile yet


[05-Feb-19 10:35 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@jl777c 

Does this look accurate?

```
## ac_ccenable

The `ac_ccenable` parameter restricts the asset chain so that only indicated CryptoConditions modules can be enabled. `ac_ccenable` requires [`ac_cc`](../installations/asset-chain-parameters.html#ac-cc) to be active.

To indicate which CryptoConditions modules should be available, insert each module's eval code in decimal and separated by commas. A list of all eval codes can be found [here](https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/master/src/cc/eval.h).  

For example, the following parameters create an asset chain where only the `faucet` and `rewards` modules are active:

```
komodod -ac_name=EXAMPLE -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=100000000 -ac_cc=2 -ac_ccenable=228,229
```

When `-ac_cc` is set, but `-ac_ccenable` is not, all CryptoConditions modules are enabled.

::: warning
If the developer is also using a new feature that has yet to be documented here, `ac_cclib`, the evalcodes in the `libcc.so` will not disable CryptoConditions RPC calls that have the risk of creating unspendable utxos.
:::

::: warning
`ac_ccenable` disables spending utxos that are created under a non-enabled CryptoConditions module. We have also implemented additional functionality that disables the RPC functions that would otherwise allow a user to create a utxo that would then be unspendable, due to `ac_ccenable`. It is still possible to create raw transactions that bypass this security feature, and thus create utxos that are unspendable. A normal user or developer relying on our RPC functionality should not be concerned with this. However, those who experiment with raw transactions should be cautious.
:::
```


[05-Feb-19 10:36 PM] jl777c#5810
also, if -ac_marmara is not set the marmara rpc wont be enabled. maybe just a general statement that we try to disable rpc calls for the corresponding evalcode

Also, `./komodod -ac_name=EXAMPLE -gen &` will start mining with 1 thread by default. `gen=0` is basically staking, not mining. `./komodod -ac_name=EXAMPLE -gen -genproclimit=2 &` will start mining with 2 threads. They can specify as many threads they like depending on their system spec on the chain start command.

@SHossain that is the perfect way to give noobs problems 😛

if you aren't careful, that's a really easy way to fork a new chain


[10-Feb-19 12:08 PM] Alright#0419
would recommend we don't use `-gen` at all in docs


[10-Feb-19 12:08 PM] Alright#0419
and use `setgenerate true` in all of them


[10-Feb-19 12:11 PM] SHossain#0007
yeah, noob can mess anywhere. current doc is suggesting to use `gen=0` without explaining that it is for staking. i'm suggesting to make this clear. imagine someone wanted to mine PoW block and use `gen=0` 😛

@Bryan_Beus it would be nice to add another example to start mining with specific number of threads in addition to showing unlimited threads example using `-1`. for example: mining with 1 thread. the command would be
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=EXAMPLE setgenerate true 1`.  (this will override mining with the chain start command using 2 threads or any other number previously used for mining.) similarly, using `./komodo-cli -ac_name=EXAMPLE setgenerate true 0` would start staking.

if you start a node with `-gen` that isn't fully synced, it forks the chain sometimes


[10-Feb-19 12:16 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, that needs to be added as warning in the docs to advice devs/users not to start mining until chain is fully synced

Just to ad to the confusion if you use VerusHash then teh chin cannot fork by using -gen 😅

@SHossain 
```
It is recommended to <b>NOT</b> use `ac_cc=0` for a chain that you do not wish to use CryptoConditions. Not using this param on a chain will have similar effect.
```
Can you explain why this is so and what the difference is?


[10-Feb-19 11:07 PM] jl777c#5810
-ac_cc=0 is the default behavior. if you are not wanting to use CC, why have it enabled?


[10-Feb-19 11:21 PM] gcharang#6833
@jl777c  So the difference is simply using a less cluttered command for starting the daemon, and there are no other differences?

@Bryan_Beus @gcharang we want to start pushing users away from creating low hashrate 100% POW chains. This includes on-demand chains. We should still mention that it's possible, but they need to be aware that they are easily susceptible to censorship attacks. We should instead recommend using some % of ac_staked for chains that expect to have very little hashrate

@SHossain 

I'm working through the changes you and gcharang submitted to dev branch of developers.

Thank you very much for contributing all of this! Makes this very easy when you write the changes right into the spot where they need to happen.

Can you please do me a favor? I've tried using `encryptwallet` on my current installation of komodod and I'm getting a `disabled` response.

It's probably just my version or something, but can you please create a curl example of the `encryptwallet` method?

I have this here, and need the second part filled in:

```
curl --user myrpcuser:myrpcpassword --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "encryptwallet", "params": ["mypassphrase"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:myrpcport/
```

Also, if it's not too much trouble, could you also please make sure to add `| jq` to the end, to properly format it?

If you're too busy, no worries. I'll come back to this.


[11-Feb-19 04:04 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@SHossain 

Also, I'm not seeing `walletpassphrase` in our current list of rpcs. Is this something new?

`encryptwallet` needs `-ac_public` chain


[11-Feb-19 04:33 PM] SHossain#0007
it should also work with other chains.

[11-Feb-19 04:42 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
```
curl --user myrpcuser:myrpcpassword --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "encryptwallet", "params": ["mypassphrase"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:myrpcport/

ie setting timestamp earlier and seeing if it actually works


[11-Feb-19 04:42 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, we have done that testing before sapling activation


[11-Feb-19 04:42 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
and use `jq`


[11-Feb-19 04:42 PM] Alright#0419
for KMD as well?


[11-Feb-19 04:43 PM] Alright#0419
I remember we tested that deadline works properly for deactivating sprout. I don't recall us testing ac_public specifically


[11-Feb-19 04:43 PM] gcharang#6833
I have just seen on KMD chain.  After doing encryptwallet and start the daemon again the other RPC like  walletlock, walletpassphrase, walletpassphrasechange are visible in the help command in the Wallet section


[11-Feb-19 04:44 PM] SHossain#0007
@Alright  we have covered that test case to send z tx after the deadline and didn't work

```
12:40 AM] Alright: @siddhartha-crypto @gcharang we want to start pushing users away from creating low hashrate 100% POW chains. This includes on-demand chains. We should still mention that it's possible, but they need to be aware that they are easily susceptible to censorship attacks. We should instead recommend using some % of ac_staked for chains that expect to have very little hashrate
```
@Bryan_Beus for this, should we rework the examples to include ac-staked in them, or just a tip box at somewhere at the top of the doc?


[11-Feb-19 05:04 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
It's probably best to rework all the examples to account for best practices.


[11-Feb-19 05:04 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Perhaps tomorrow, you could work together with Alright on it.


[11-Feb-19 05:04 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
?


[11-Feb-19 05:04 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Let me get this settled first and pushed to master.

{Reactions}
👍 

[11-Feb-19 05:06 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Actually, @gcharang, since @Alright is the master tester for asset chain params, maybe we should let him go through all the examples and fix them for best practices?

Or at least leave notes for us to do the changes.


[11-Feb-19 05:07 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@gcharang 

Do you have that documentation from the `walletchangepassphrase`?


[11-Feb-19 05:08 PM] Alright#0419
sorry, which examples? All the -ac_name=EXAMPLE lines?


[11-Feb-19 05:08 PM] gcharang#6833
It is taking a while for starting the kmd daemon eachtime encryptwallet is used


[11-Feb-19 05:08 PM] gcharang#6833
My daemon is starting now


[11-Feb-19 05:09 PM] gcharang#6833
its loading blocks


[11-Feb-19 05:09 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Alright 

If we're trying to discourage people using setting chains without `ac_staked`, then it might be good to treat that as a best practice and do that for all chains?

You tell us, you're the pro.


[11-Feb-19 05:11 PM] Alright#0419
if chain creator doesn't expect the chain to have much hashrate, best practice is to use ac_staked, but this doesn't mean they still can't choose to do on-demand or 100% POW


[11-Feb-19 05:11 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@gcharang 

I'm stepping out of the office for a bit and will be back soon.

In the meantime, I just went through all of your Pull Request and tried to make sure that the grammar/styling/voice is consistent with the rest of the doc. 

Can you please look through?

There were a few things regarding technical matters that I changed in the `asset-chain-parameters.md` doc, because Alright and I have been working on it since you last saw it and there were some new pieces of info.

I think with everything else, I don't recall changing any technical details, but if something looks amiss, let me know.

If you can, please submit your reviews as another pull request. It works very well.


[11-Feb-19 05:12 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Okay, @Alright. 

Just as long as you're happy with it. I'll shoot it to you as soon as I can for additional review.


[11-Feb-19 05:12 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442

Letme try


[11-Feb-19 05:17 PM] Alright#0419
Ah sorry, so this doesn't automatically start the daemon. Basically you'll connect to nodes on a new ac_staked chain, then prior to mining block 1, run this "Start new chain" option in TUI


[11-Feb-19 05:18 PM] Alright#0419
that make sense? Still trying to work out how to make it truly automatic

[12-Feb-19 09:46 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@gcharang 

Regarding the `<b>` in the tip box, I couldn't remember if that was me or you that did that. Sorry. When I first started writing on the docs, back with the Slate framework, the upticks didn't work, so I used bold, and I thought these were leftovers.

I'm okay with changing them to `<b>`, but if that's the case, then it needs to be consistent across the entire set of documentation. 

Would you have time to go through and change them in every rpc command?

If you can, great. If not, no worries. But if not, then let's stick with the upticks, just for consistency's sake. 

Thank you.


[12-Feb-19 11:42 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Also, @gcharang,

did you ever get a chance to go through all the `./komodo-cli help` commands to make sure that we're not missing any rpcs in the developers docs?


[12-Feb-19 01:11 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@jl777c @Alright 

I put this in the `ac_blocktime` notes to account for what you (JL777) said on the private team channel.

```
When the value of `ac_blocktime` is less than `12` seconds (a high speed asset chain), the variances in network quality between miners and stakers can create difficulties in achieving a stable blockchain consensus. High-speed asset chains may function effectively on a LAN or other stable network, but Komodo recommends caution when attempting to manage a high speed asset chain on the public Internet. 
```

Is that accurate?


[12-Feb-19 01:13 PM] jl777c#5810
yes


[12-Feb-19 01:27 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442

@Alright 

I think he's only referring to your branch.


[18-Feb-19 03:58 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@dimxy 

Hey bud, I'm looking over the Heir CC module. 

This is a really great start! Thank you so much for putting everything in a matching format. This makes my job much easier. 

I'm looking at this one paragraph you've put in here, and I need more information.

```
When using the Heir CC module on a private chain, to make funds available for the heir, you should wait for inactivity time and add any arbitrary transaction to the chain (for the duration between owner tx and chain tip to be calculated correctly).
```

Can you tell me more about the aspect of waiting for inactive time and adding an arbitrary transaction to the chain? Do you mean, as soon as the arbitrary wait time has passed, the developer (?) (or the heir?) should make an arbitrary transaction?

Also, there's something in there about there being a required time between the owner's last trasnsaction and the chain tip?


[18-Feb-19 04:08 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Another question:

```
The heiradd rpc call allows to add funds from non-owner uxtos. Those additions will be considered as donations and will not be accounted in calculation if heir is allowed to spend funds. The heiradd rpc call warns the user whether he is making a donation to the fund. The heiradd rpc call also would not allow to add funds from both owner and non-owner inputs simultaneously. In any case such fund additions will be considered as donations too.
```

Can you please tell me more about what you mean by `will not be accounted in calculation if heir is allowed to spend funds`?

Does this mean that if an outside user (not the owner) adds funds to the address, only the owner can spend those funds, and not the heir?


[18-Feb-19 07:55 PM] gcharang#6833
@Bryan_Beus I am already working on the heir doc. I have got the above things clarified from dimxy. Its in my branch. Once I am done editing it, I will have it checked by dimxy again for inaccuracies. Then I will submit a PR to dev

@Bryan_Beus @Mylo I have also created a new branch called `components` for testing new components to enhance the docs. Currently I added the component https://github.com/feathers-plus/generator-feathers-plus/blob/master/docs/.vuepress/components/collapse.vue to it and its working well.

To see how it works,:
`git checkout components`
 then build the site on localhost. 
Go to  http://localhost:8080/basic-docs/komodo-api/address.html#examples look at  the togglable button in the **Response** heading

If it is good, I can add a similar toggle button to other responses that are really huge and cause irritation when skimming through the docs

@gcharang 

I just worked over the Heir CC docs and pushed changes to `dev`. Please review when you get a chance.

Looking over other changes now.


[20-Feb-19 04:46 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Also, there is a file, `2`, in the `../cryptoconditions/` directory. 

I would like to delete it, but let me know if you wanted it for something.


[20-Feb-19 04:50 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@gcharang 

I'm looking through other changes now.

Did you use a regular expression to remove all the tick marks around linked commands?

i.e. `[\`channelsopen\`]` --> `[channelsopen]`?

There are some errors in the removal code, it would appear. I found a section in CC Dice that had tickmarks in the wrong places and was adding text blocks to the wrong text. 

Let me know and we'll take a look to make sure that there aren't any other hard to find issues like this one.


[20-Feb-19 05:06 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Found another occurrence in the asset-chain-parameters.md doc.


[20-Feb-19 05:08 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
And a few more. 

Hmm, can you show me the regular expression you used to change this, so we can make sure we find all of these?


[20-Feb-19 05:11 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I think I can see what happened.

It looks like you wrote a search and replace that goes line by line and removes the first instance of a backtick bracket combo and the last instance of a backtick-bracket combo. When there's only one instance of each per line, it works fine. But on lines with multiple relevant elements, it fails.


[20-Feb-19 06:41 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@gcharang 

Let me know when you are ready. 

I found many mistakes in the documentation, from many sources. We should try to get this finished fast.


[20-Feb-19 07:26 PM] Mylo#8306
re-run the regex, it will then get the 1st occurrence of the 2nd one, when it is the first, the second time.. maybe?

We have to go through the heir-cc doc in dev that got merged in the last PR and 
the new musig doc.
 Also I added two new docs that go along with it: cclib in komodo-api and instructions for dynamic modules


[28-Feb-19 02:37 AM] gcharang#6833
I wasn't able to verify `the details about 100K block rule` so either you or @Alright need to finalise the descriptions

[28-Feb-19 12:19 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
The 100K block rule should be fine. Alright took a look. 

Thank you for putting together the components branch. I will take a look as soon as I have time. It may have to wait. 

I will look at heir-cc new. 

I need to get the gateways cc updated first - it is the highest priority, and for that, I have to review everything since the last merge to master, and merge in your current PR and review that. 

That is taking a lot of my time right now.

MuSig, Dilithium, and Heir are all next up on the list. 

Thank you.

This information comes across as instructions that would be necessary for a developer that is building a new CC module, but not necessary for a developer that is using an existing CC module.

Is that an accurate assessment?

When either of you have time, I would like to ask some questions.


[05-Mar-19 01:41 PM] jl777c#5810
regular ones are linked into the main komodod


[05-Mar-19 01:41 PM] jl777c#5810
dynamic ones are in libcc.so


[05-Mar-19 01:41 PM] jl777c#5810
libcc.dylib and libcc.dll depending on OS


[05-Mar-19 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
each libcc has the same eval codes, so you change the CC by changing the libcc


[05-Mar-19 01:55 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Hmm, okay. 

Do readers of this documentation need to know how to make a new dynamic module, or do they only need to know how to use existing dynamic modules?

[05-Mar-19 03:20 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Documentation about how to write new dynamic modules would be separate from documentation about how to use it.

For now, for each CryptoConditions module that utilizes a CCLib library, it is only necessary to include instructions about how to download and install the library, and from there launch the asset chain that uses the module. 

Does that make sense?


[05-Mar-19 03:20 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@SHossain @jl777c


[05-Mar-19 03:21 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
So, for this documentation file, I would like to have it only contain information about how to download the relevant CCLib library, place it in the correct directory, and then launch the asset chain.


[05-Mar-19 03:21 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Is this okay, or am I not understanding how the dynamic modules work?


[05-Mar-19 10:54 PM] jl777c#5810
that seems right. for now all the libcc variants can be built from the main source tree


[06-Mar-19 06:46 AM] gcharang#6833
I included that info there as it gives some insight into how the dynamic modules differ from inbuilt ones. Also it clears some confusion on build process for a komodod that contains dynamic modules by highlighting how `libcc.so` is being used. @Bryan_Beus 
You can remove it if that doesn't seem to sit well with the rest of the documentation

This is from documentation from gcharang


[07-Mar-19 04:54 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
here the text states that we need to import the private key corresponding to the pubkey used to launch the asset chain


[07-Mar-19 04:55 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
However, if I correctly understand the instructions for obtaining a pubkey, I would think that we would already have the priv key in the wallet, correct?

@gcharang 

In this part of the example for Musig, can you please provide me with the full json response from the `getrawtransaction` rpc?

##### Decode the Transaction

Decode the raw transaction to take note of the `hex`value in the `scriptPubKey` of the change `vout` i.e., `vout` of the type `pubkey`

Command:

```bash
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MUSIG  getrawtransaction 09daa45cb6e17028f9568347291a993cbf29c152a527b53e9ac0925d4900c293 1
```

Response:

::: tip 

- Showing only the relevant part.
- in the decoded transaction, look for the key `vout` which is an array of `jsons` .
- Each of these `jsons` represents a different `vout`
- The one useful for us is the one that has 
  `"type": "pubkey"` in it. 

:::

```json
{
  "value": 0.0998,
  "valueSat": 9980000,
  "n": 1,
  "scriptPubKey": {

@Deleted User 

The following is the description of `scriptPubkey` in the MuSig CC rpc, `calcmsg`.

The `scriptPubkey` value is returned from the `calcmsg`, by the way.

Here it is:

```
| scriptPubKey | (string) | a modified form of a pubkey. This is the pubkey that will receive the spent funds. modification: concatenate `21` at the beginning and `ac` at the end of the pubkey; If pubkey is `02f7597468703c1c5c8465dd6d43acaae697df9df30bed21494d193412a1ea193e` then scriptPubkey will be `2102f7597468703c1c5c8465dd6d43acaae697df9df30bed21494d193412a1ea193eac` |
```


[07-Mar-19 07:56 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
See where it starts with `modification: concatenate...` etc.?


[07-Mar-19 07:56 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Can you help me understand what's going on there?


[07-Mar-19 07:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
you take a pubkey, add 21 at the start and ac at the end to get the ScriptPubKey hex. There are other types of ScriptPubKey but those are more complciated.


[07-Mar-19 07:58 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Is this done automatically, previously? Or is it something the user must do themselves?

I see that in the `hex` value...


[07-Mar-19 07:59 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Look at the way `calcmsg` is introduced:


[07-Mar-19 07:59 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
## calcmsg

**cclib calcmsg 18 '["sendtxid" , "scriptPubKey"]'**

The `calcmsg` method takes the indicated `sendtxid` and the indicated `scriptPubkey` and calculates the `msg` value.

### Arguments: 

| Name         | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

I  assume your taking about where you get the scriptpubkey to pay the musig sepnd to


[07-Mar-19 08:00 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
and then look at the way we talk about `scriptPubkey` in the walkthrough:


[07-Mar-19 08:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
if you fetch it from the hex value... you do nothing


[07-Mar-19 08:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
if your paying to a pubkey itself you need to add 21 and ac


[07-Mar-19 08:00 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Decode the raw transaction to take note of the `hex` value in the `scriptPubKey` of the `vout` value that has the `"type":"pubkey"` key pair.

Command:

```bash
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MUSIG getrawtransaction 09daa45cb6e17028f9568347291a993cbf29c152a527b53e9ac0925d4900c293 1
```

In the response there are a series of `vout` values, each of which has an array of json objects. Search for the `vout` value that has the `"type":"pubkey"` key pair listed. In this object, retrieve the `hex` value from the `scriptPubkey`:

```json
(omitted for brevity)

...

{
  "value": 0.0998,
  "valueSat": 9980000,
  "n": 1,
  "scriptPubKey": {
    "asm": "0225f1cbbda1a0c406bb8f6dc7a589d88b2f9e28cd4fdb3f59139f8aff1f5d270a OP_CHECKSIG",
    "hex": "210225f1cbbda1a0c406bb8f6dc7a589d88b2f9e28cd4fdb3f59139f8aff1f5d270aac",
    "reqSigs": 1,
    "type": "pubkey",
    "addresses": ["RUfCUd3UryKJ49baQvSuAs42wakNunvvfT"]
  }
}

...

```

The `hex` value in the `scriptPubkey` object is our `change_script` value. Copy this value and save it to a secure location for later use.


[07-Mar-19 08:00 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
See how we call it the `change_script` value? ^


[07-Mar-19 08:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
this is where the musig spend is sent to


[07-Mar-19 08:01 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Should we use `change_script` in `calcmsg`?


[07-Mar-19 08:01 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Instead of `scriptPubkey`?


[07-Mar-19 08:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
you can use any scriptpubkey its aform of address, just lower level


[07-Mar-19 08:02 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm referring to the terminology in `calcmsg`. Would it make more sense to call the argument in `calcmsg`, `change_script` as so:


[07-Mar-19 08:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
change_script is an example.. all that does is spend the musig back to the person who sent the funds to the musig combined pubkey. you can use any scriptpubkey


[07-Mar-19 08:03 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
## calcmsg 
 
**cclib calcmsg 18 '["sendtxid" , "scriptPubKey"]'**

I think I understand better now...


[07-Mar-19 08:04 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Hmm, I think what we need to do then is explain the `modifcation` thing in the introductory paragraph, and not in the table.


[07-Mar-19 08:04 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Let me try that real quick.


[07-Mar-19 08:06 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Deleted User 

Does this make sense?

## calcmsg

**cclib calcmsg 18 '["sendtxid" , "scriptPubKey"]'**

The `calcmsg` method takes the indicated `sendtxid` and the indicated `scriptPubkey` and calculates the `msg` value.

Usage of this method depends upon the [cclib](../komodo-api/cclib.html#cclib) method. The `EVALCODE` is `18`.

The `scriptPubkey` argument can be any valid `pubkey`. To create a `scriptPubkey` from a normal `pubkey`, simply add the values `21` to the beginning of the `pubkey` string and the values `ac` to the end of the string:

```
scriptPubkey = 21 + pubkey + ac
```


[07-Mar-19 08:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
yes thats a good way to put it. Very clear. the first example when I started testing musig was extremly unclear why it weas usig the change scriptpubkey took me many hours to work out what it was actaulyl for.


[07-Mar-19 08:36 PM] gcharang#6833
@Bryan_Beus I can give you that decoded raw transaction, but it is toooo big. I was mining on that node so there were 10 tiny vins that were in the transaction. If we add the whole decoded output instead of the relevant part, the doc will instantly double in size for no added clarity that I can see


[07-Mar-19 08:36 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
oh good, thanks, @Deleted User

[07-Mar-19 08:37 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
We don't need to keep the whole decoded raw transaction, but I want to know more about the surrounding content

after I'm done with my pass on the MuSig docs, I would really appreciate it if you would read over it, make any necessary corrections, and pass them back as a pull request?

Would you have time?

should just do the above and describe how to change a pubkey to scriptpubkey becasue thats where its being sent to... dont want to lock the musig spend only back to the person who sent them the coins, seems not useful .


[07-Mar-19 08:38 PM] Deleted User#0000

The docs will litterally be missing everythign I added, but that is a good thing as it will only confuse people.

its just there to suimulate lots of nodes on 1 node.


[07-Mar-19 08:41 PM] gcharang#6833
Ah, didn't know about that, I did test after the verify and spend conflict was fixed, but didn't know about the "suimulate lots of nodes on 1 node" will test again


[07-Mar-19 08:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
yeah, basically to test what I added you just run `musigtest.py` in /src/ dir


[07-Mar-19 08:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
and maybe check that 2 nodes still works.

We are going to have to deal with the `dynamic` aspect of CC modules separately. There is a lot going on here, and I have spoken about this with James. 

Dynamic CC modules will need their own separate approach. We'll come to that later. For now,  I just want to get all of James's hard work into a good documentation state, and have it available on developers.komodoplatform.com


[07-Mar-19 09:09 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
So, for now, let's just make sure that all the sections in the current CC-MuSig documentation are accurate and that any newcomer that tests it out will be able to follow it through and have a good experience.


[07-Mar-19 09:09 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
So, anyway, take a look at that `Step 11` documentation. I'm not sure I understood that section correctly. Can you pelase review?


[07-Mar-19 09:11 PM] gcharang#6833
yes that is how it was working when I wrote the doc, but don't know if jl modified it recently. Will have to test


[07-Mar-19 09:13 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ok, good to know. 

I needed to make sure that I was correct in my guess that both nodes do not need to broadcast the transaction.


[07-Mar-19 09:14 PM] gcharang#6833
@Bryan_Beus 
```
Both nodes have now executed the command, but the response on both nodes is only a raw transaction. One of the nodes must broadcast the raw hex value. The node that executes the sendrawtransaction method will receive the coins. The other node does not need to broadcast a hex value, and no attempt to broadcast the hex value will succeed.
```
the way it used to work, the nodes received different rawtxns in the response and whichever node can get its rawtxn confirmed first, would have got the coins
but that is not supposed to happen and how you wrote it should be the behaviour idk if james modified the code, will test and tell you later


[07-Mar-19 09:14 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442

@Bryan_Beus you do have the explanations for the methods session, commit so on.. written by me correct, I can't see them in the dev branch doc right now. If you want they are in the musig branch


[07-Mar-19 09:21 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Hmm, I'll take a look soon and compare the two. I'll do that tomorrow.

I won't be able to finish the Workflow section of the docs tonight anyway.


[07-Mar-19 09:23 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@gcharang 

I keep seeing this line and thinking it's a typo, but perhaps I'm wrong, since it happens so often:

```
| ind        | (decimal number) | index of the node, whose `partialsig` is now added to the global struct |
```


[07-Mar-19 09:23 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Should that be `global structure`?


[07-Mar-19 09:26 PM] gcharang#6833
yse that is a global data structure. I have edited that too in the musig branch 😅


[07-Mar-19 09:30 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok, thanks


[07-Mar-19 09:31 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@gcharang 

I just went through most of a full pass. I did not fix much, or even anything at all, in the Workflow section.

Everything else received some attention.

Can you please take a look?

I'll be back to work on this more tomorrow. I will go through the Workflow section, and I will compare differences between dev and musig branch.


[07-Mar-19 09:32 PM] gcharang#6833
Will do @Bryan_Beus


[07-Mar-19 09:32 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
great, thank you


[07-Mar-19 11:02 PM] gcharang#6833
@Bryan_Beus I think its best if you take a look at the doc in the musig branch before going through the workflow section

@gcharang 

I checked the commit histories for the dev branch's cc-musig.md document, and for the musig branch's cc-musig.md document.

I don't believe there are any issues.

I copy/pasted the last version of the cc-musig file  from the musig branch on Feb 28th, and there have been no changes to the musig branch's cc-musig doc since then. 

I think we're good there.


[08-Mar-19 02:22 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Deleted User 

Thank you very much for being willing to provide feedback on the cc-musig documentation.

It is ready for you to take a look.

The best way to provide feedback is to fork the repository to your local account, make sure you are on the dev branch, and then go through the file and make changes as you see fit.

I am able to adopt changes fastest when you simply write right over the top of any mistakes I have made. Don't worry about grammar, voice, or styling. I will fix those afterwards. Simply make sure that any technically inaccurate or missing information is corrected right where it needs to be fixed.

Once you are done, submit the changes as a single Pull Request. I will merge this into the active dev branch, run a git diff to view all changes, and come back to you with any remaining questions.

Thank you so much!

Once you have signed off, I believe the MuSig documentation will be ready to push to the master branch.

Here is a link to the file:

[08-Mar-19 05:29 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@gcharang 

One other question about MuSig


[08-Mar-19 05:30 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
We didn't put `%22` and the escape characters around all the parameters/arguments.


[08-Mar-19 05:30 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
These are necessary here, correct? Since we're using cclib?


[08-Mar-19 05:31 PM] gcharang#6833
@Bryan_Beus 
> I checked the commit histories for the dev branch's cc-musig.md document, and for the musig branch's cc-musig.md document.

That doesn't say anything as the version in docs branch has been added directly and not through `git merge`. It only says the initial commit on the dev branch version and the final commit on the musig version were on the same day.

 > I don't believe there are any issues.

Look at the explanation for the verify method:
```
in dev version:

The `verify` method returns several values that are necessary to execute a transaction using the MuSig module.
```

```
In musig version:

The `verify` method verifies that the `combinedsig` is able to spend the funds owned by `combined_pk` which were refered to when the message ( `msg` ) has been produced using the [calcmsg](../dynamic/cc-musig.html#calcmsg) method.
```
If you thought the version in dev branch is better then its fine, but if you didn't notice the musig version , then we have both repeated the same work to result in a less clear version going online.

All the explanantions you had to add for the methods, I have already added them, all the global structs you had to edit, I had already corrected them,

I can take a look at the new doc and update it to include clearer explanantions for methods if you'd like


[08-Mar-19 05:32 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Your explanations are better.


[08-Mar-19 05:32 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
You can add them in.


[08-Mar-19 05:32 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I was under the impression that we didn't have any, and therefore I thought that we weren't going to add descriptions, and I wanted something there.


[08-Mar-19 05:32 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
If you want to do that before @Deleted User does a review, that would be great.


[08-Mar-19 05:33 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I have time to take a look at any additions you make today, as well.


[08-Mar-19 05:33 PM] gcharang#6833
> These are necessary here, correct? Since we're using cclib?
The examples we have in the doc work with `' "" '` work fine, but we have the version with `%22` in the rogue doc


[08-Mar-19 05:33 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Earlier, we came to the conclusion that since JL uses %22 and escapes, that's what we should put on the docs, if I recall?


[08-Mar-19 05:34 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Are there any situations where it might make a difference?


[08-Mar-19 05:34 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I think there is one example on cc-musig right now that uses %22, also.


[08-Mar-19 05:36 PM] gcharang#6833
I think we should change them to %22 but mention that `' "" '` version will work too. https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/536506739801980938/552327716859412481 here he says that `' "" '` won't work with bash scripts so %22 version is better.
I can change the examples if you'd like


[08-Mar-19 05:37 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
That would be very helpful. 

If JL states that the non-escaped version are unreliable, then we can just move everything to %22 and escapes around quotation marks. There's no need to mention the other way, since it's unreliable and we want to encourage good habits so our users don't get confused and blame the software instead of their habits.


[08-Mar-19 05:38 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442

have you tried playing ROGUE manually?


[08-Mar-19 06:10 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
How do you do things, like move or attack, etc.?

On the pdf tutorial for classic rogue, there are a bunch of in-game controls.

https://docs.freebsd.org/44doc/usd/30.rogue/paper.pdf

Turn to section 4 and look at "Commands"

How does the player execute these in manual gameplay?


[08-Mar-19 06:12 PM] Alright#0419
@Bryan_Beus manual gameplay is the same as other gameplay


[08-Mar-19 06:13 PM] Alright#0419
it still launches the same rogue dapp, should be the same exact in game experience once dapp is launched


[08-Mar-19 06:13 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Okay, so the TUI just gets rid of the game creation and shut down procedure. Is that correct?


[08-Mar-19 06:13 PM] Alright#0419
yes

[08-Mar-19 06:32 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
The example method that you've included uses the `pubkey` launch parameter. 

I'm not familiar, but I'm wondering if we should be using `ac_pubkey` instead?


[08-Mar-19 06:34 PM] gcharang#6833
the command is correct, but the line:
```
To reuse this pubkey in the future, include the pubkey as an ac_pubkey launch parameter.
```
should be changed `ac_pubkey` to `pubkey`


[08-Mar-19 06:35 PM] Alright#0419
adding ac_pubkey to launch params changes the chain you're trying to sync


[08-Mar-19 06:35 PM] Alright#0419
a user would never be adding ac_pubkey themselves. It's something that the creator of the chain must specify and all users must follow

cc-rogue.md is not finished yet, but it is fairly close.

The main thing left to do are the descriptions and the argument/response tables. 

If you want to work on those between now and when I come in tomorrow (about twelve hours or so from now), that will be great. No worries if you have other stuff going on. 

Thank you very much.

[09-Mar-19 12:50 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm going to add a note about `%22` etc. in the `cclib` method, and we can just link to it.


[09-Mar-19 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
if not using bash scripts you can use ' or " depending on what parsers it goes through


[09-Mar-19 12:53 PM] jl777c#5810
the %22 is just a way to ensure it can survive intact through whatever parsing


[09-Mar-19 01:11 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Right, here is what I just put in cclib


[09-Mar-19 01:11 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@jl777c 

Arguments for `cclib` methods are supplied as arrays. When executed in the terminal, the values for the array can be added in a normal fashion. However, when `cclib` methods are executed as a part of a script, the shell cannot parse the arrays without additional formatting.  

#### Array Formatting for Terminal

In the terminal, the array is bound by `''` single-quotation characters and strings are bound by `""` double-quotation characters.

Terminal format:

```bash
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MUSIG  cclib send 18 '["03d31479e789014a96ba6dd60d50210045aa8292fe693f293d44615929f04cf57a",1]'
```

#### Array Formatting for Bash Scripts

In a bash-script, the array is bound by `\"\"` escaped double-quotation characters and strings within the array are bound by `%22 %22` characters. (`0x22` is the ASCII encoding for `"`.)

Script format:

```bash
./komodo-cli -ac_name=MUSIG  cclib send 18 \"[%2203d31479e789014a96ba6dd60d50210045aa8292fe693f293d44615929f04cf57a%22,1]\"
```

This format can be used in a terminal directly or in shell scripts.

Then we can just mention elsewhere throughout CC documentation to make sure to read the instructions on the `cclib` method regarding how to format an array for different use cases.

@gcharang 

I'm working through ROGUE right now. 

Thank you for your additions in the last pull request. Very helpful.

I'm looking at the `%22` markers we have in here, and thinking about how it compares to the MuSig docs, where we did not include them.

We need to decide between the two.

I included a full explanation of the `%22` markers in the `cclib` method in the Komodo API section, based on your initial write up of the issue.

We need to have MuSig and Rogue match. Either MuSig needs `%22` in the descriptions and examples for its methods, or Rogue needs to have the markers removed.

If we don't use the `%22` markers in the methods, we can put a mention to read the `cclib` section carefully when writing scripts. That would likely have to go in each description of each method. Sounds rather repetitious, but it's an option.

Or, we could just put `%22` markers in everything.

Or, we could do something else.

What do you think?

@gcharang 

I've worked over the cc-rogue and cc-musig docs, as far as I can go without more input. 

If you know any of the missing information, let me know. 

Otherwise, we need someone from the tech team to point to where we can find more info.

The information that is missing:

Several arguments/responses need description info in the tables

The `keystrokes` and `extract` method don't have any information. There's nothing in Tony's file about them, so I'll need more info to finish them.

`extract` relatively new call - will add to excel. It using for game progress extracting and possibility to replay the game locally.
Example of call:
 ```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib extract 17 \"[%226bb0efcb14cd5101a4d8d8865c6a93162aa9480c5d3e0ce33902193cebdc4c39%22,%220325151cf0f7321d0cde232898c5adc6b60f32df71b79af3a49d10020d42925ae9%22]\"
```
First param is gametxid, second is pubkey or wallet address of player whom played this game

I will change the examples in rogue doc to match musig


[10-Mar-19 02:31 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Sounds good. I think the fact that we already mention in each CC Rogue/MuSig rpc that it depends on cclib is enough, for now, about the %22 marker thing. But maybe we can find a better way to organize it later.

Anyhow, 

thank you for the updates. I added `keystrokes` and `extract` to the existing CC Rogue docs.

I still need someone from the tech team to go through all the tables for arguments and responses and fill in missing information, and also check all the other descriptions. I had to guess for each description, so there may be errors.

Once we get someone from tech to go through CC Rogue and do these things, and once we can adopt all changes, we should be finished with CC Rogue as well. 

So, both CC MuSig and CC Rogue can be pushed to master tomorrow. 

The other CC's that we are working on are cc-momom, cc-assets, and cc-sudoku.

I don't know of any initial documentation for any of these. I've made dummy files to get started on the dev branch, but they're still basically empty. 

I'll be back to work on all of this tomorrow. 'Till then, have a great weekend.

Hi Tony, I just finished a first pass at the Sudoku documentation.

There are various pieces of information missing. Any table item that doesn't have a description needs assistance, and in general all of the table items need review. I only made educated guesses about each one.

When you have time, let's go through cc momom and get some docs down.

There are still a few questions and missing items in tables.

If you can please look through the hidden comments `<!-- -->` and all rpc tables for missing information, and also just make a general pass over the whole thing again to make sure it's accurate, I think we will be very close to being finished with CC Rogue.

@Bryan_Beus https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/developer-docs/pull/49 a little bit more clarifications on rogue

```We need to add a section that explains how the keystrokes are translated from the button push on the keyboard to the long string of characters we see in the example.``` 
Process as was discussed above in this channel: player press buttons, it's logging  as ASCII symbols and sending as hex string each level. Extract call concatenating all received keystroke in one mega keystroke.

So I'm confused a little if I understood question correct - if some deeper details needed, I wonder it's better to ask James

@gcharang there are repos by smk762 with cool oracle stuff. who exactly will you ask about finding missing repos?


[13-Mar-19 05:40 AM] gcharang#6833
I was thinking of doing a `everyone` call in a developer channel and add the responses


[13-Mar-19 05:43 AM] jl777c#5810
and generally if you see a new repo that is relevant, add it

could someone show me an example of using cclib method without wrapping everything in %22? Maybe I misunderstood something, but I think someone here said it was possible

@Alright 
```'["txid"]'```


[13-Mar-19 07:53 AM] jl777c#5810
%22 is just ascii for "


[13-Mar-19 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
I use some bash scripts and didnt want to hassle with various escapes for different parsing and %22 worked in all things I tried


[13-Mar-19 07:54 AM] TonyL#3577
Windows dont like ' stuff as I know


[13-Mar-19 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
\"[%22...%22]\" was therefore my universally parsable syntax


[13-Mar-19 07:55 AM] TonyL#3577
As Decker said: ` just don't use single quotes on Windows, forget that you have symbol ' on your keyboard`


[13-Mar-19 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
could well be easier to use syntax is possible


[13-Mar-19 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
i think i also support \"['...']\"

@TonyL 

Regarding this suggestion here:

```

<!-- I need more clarification on the part about how to find a `playertxid` when the developer only has a `tokentxid`

From other side in `playerinfo` can be found `gametxid` in which this character `playertxid` participated so this way is possible to detect actual `playertxid` for given `tokenid`.

TonyL: How warriors scanner (actual playertxid searcher is stage 3) implemented in TUI:
1) I'm taking list of all tokens existing on chain by `tokenlist` call
2) Checking for each token if it a rogue character by `playerinfo` call (in case of error - it's not character but usual token/token of other application)
3) For tokeinds which I'm detected as ROGUE character I'm checking `playerinfo` again - if it have batontxid - it means that he was reused in other game and playertxid not actual for this tokentxid, so I'm getting playerinfo for batontxid and so on to point where playerinfo don't have batontxid key. From such playerinfo without batontxid I'm taking playertxid 
4) Then I'm checking if this character alive or not (iterating this actual playertxid list to check if specific token vout is spent for this playertxid)
-->
```

It looks like a fine solution. Are you okay, though, if we don't include it? This seems to me like logic that different developers would approach differently?

Or do we expect that a developer will get stuck while having a `tokentxid` without a `playertxid`?


[13-Mar-19 02:17 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@TonyL


[13-Mar-19 02:17 PM] TonyL#3577
It's a very tricky matter and one of most important clues in whole ROGUE imo (difference between tokentxid and playertxid and it's detection) 
Way of implementation in TUI I wrote just as an attempt for clarification by this `I need more clarification on the part about how to find a `playertxid` when the developer only has a `tokentxid`` request


[13-Mar-19 02:17 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I notice that in this section here:

```
["keystrokes","17","[%22777ba510824b467e9ddfb00a075e9cd5c6f73d1fa6f772b1a22563502def25ee%22,%226a68686868686866686820686868682068686868206868666868686c6c6c6c6a6a6a6a6a6a6a6a6c6c6c6c6c6c6c6c6c6c6c6c6c6c6c6c6c6c6c6c6c6c6c6c6a6a6a68666b%22]"]

This example doesn't have the usual preamble: `./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib keystrokes 17 ...`


[13-Mar-19 02:18 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442

REgarding this:

> It's a very tricky matter and one of most important clues in whole ROGUE imo (difference between tokentxid and playertxid and it's detection) 

Do you think we need to explain to the dev how to find a `playertxid` when all they have is a `tokenid`? Or should we leave that up to them?


[13-Mar-19 02:19 PM] TonyL#3577
I think that it might save time and also think that there is no other easy way at the moment


[13-Mar-19 02:19 PM] TonyL#3577
It might be not only - but working solution


[13-Mar-19 02:19 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Regarding the `cclib keystrokes` example, did you notice that right below the recent additions, there was an example with what I believe is the same command?


[13-Mar-19 02:20 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Re: `tokenid`, okay, so let's include it then.

I'll have more questions in a sec. 

I don't follow all the logic, so we'll need to try a few times to explain it. Give me a sec.

[13-Mar-19 03:03 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@TonyL 

When you get back:

One question, in Step 8 of the Single-Player Walkthrough, there is this sentence when talking about the`bailout` method:

```
Save your character.
```


[13-Mar-19 03:04 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Is this a command that the player should enter?

Or is the sentence that follows after already including these instructions?

```
To quit the game, type the letter `Q` on the keyboard. This opens a context menu. Type the letter `n` and press `Enter`.
```


[13-Mar-19 03:13 PM] TonyL#3577
Ouch, will review this step. It seems like sentences messed/some text stashed on my side. In general it should be like:
```If your character is still alive and you would like to leave the game, follow this procedure.
To quit the game, type the letter Q on the keyboard. This opens a context menu. Type the letter n and press Enter.
This will convert your in-game gold to ROGUE coins at a ratio of ROGUE_satoshis = gold * gold * dungeon_level_on_exit * 10 and save your character which will return to you in form of NFT and you'll able to find him in `players 17` list output and reuse in next register and check info about him by playerinfo call and ...```

Btw in highlander now not correct information as well, just noticed:
```
To use the character again, save the transaction id that is returned from the above command and use it when executing the register method for a future game.```
Highlander and bailout txids != playertxid which using on registration


[13-Mar-19 03:13 PM] TonyL#3577

[13-Mar-19 03:15 PM] TonyL#3577

I will push all my updates to dev branch soon. I'm doing a quick rundow.


[13-Mar-19 03:29 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@TonyL 

Okay, dev branch updated.

Check for comments in `<!-- -->`. Some table descriptions to add, etc. 

After you are finished, and if you have not already, please do read through all the tables in detail to make sure that they are accurate. I guessed on many of them while writing, and there may be some mistakes. 

It is easiest if you build the site on localhost and view it in its final format. There are instructions in the README file of the root directory of the repository.

I'm using browser, yes. I don't have enough time resources now for proof-reading, sorry.
Maybe next time just will start to write such doc without assumtions? If play rogue few times via TUI most of moments and flow in general will be very clear.


[14-Mar-19 10:10 AM] TonyL#3577
There were moments like you never tried to play: `some player argue on not working  save by s button bug`, `bailout and highlander generating txid which possible to use as register argument` and so on. I think if try product first - its possible to avoid such things on documenting


[14-Mar-19 10:35 AM] TonyL#3577
Before gateways doc was moved to new one based on some assumtions from correct flow  to incorrect logic flow so Mihailo spent time on proof reading.
 I'm not critique or something - just wonder that it would be more productive if make some list of questions in places where assumptions not possible to resolve by trying (in case of such complex stuff as gateways for example) and then provide answers on questions is much easier than proofread.


[14-Mar-19 11:01 AM] TonyL#3577

Looking forward to finally explore what dillitihum needed for 😂 , hope it'll be revealed in video 🙏   @Alright


[14-Mar-19 11:18 AM] Alright#0419
well it's quantum resistant. We figured no one would bother to use it unless there was an immediate need for quantum resistance, so it has the added feature of unique handles. Basically you can register an identity(handle) on the blockchain that is tied to you, people can send coins via dilithium directly to the handle, and the only person able to spend these coins is the person who owns the key that registered the handle


[14-Mar-19 11:19 AM] Alright#0419
so instead of "send coins to `R......`" it can be "send coins to `Alright`"


[14-Mar-19 11:19 AM] gcharang#6833
normal digital signature schemes like ECDSA assume that large numbers can't be split into prime factors very easily for their security.
One of the usecases of QuantumComputing is to factorise large numbers into primes, so dilithium is a signature scheme that uses cryptography that isn't immediately under threat from QC


[14-Mar-19 11:24 AM] TonyL#3577
So main purpose is protection from quantum computers double-spending attacks?


[14-Mar-19 11:24 AM] jl777c#5810
not double spending


[14-Mar-19 11:25 AM] jl777c#5810
simply going from pubkey -> privkey -> spend all your coins


[14-Mar-19 11:26 AM] TonyL#3577
Ah, so protection from privkey brootforcing by quantum computer?


[14-Mar-19 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
yes. dilithium CC requires both secp256k1 signature and dilithium signature


[14-Mar-19 11:28 AM] jl777c#5810
Dilithium is a digital signature scheme that is strongly secure under chosen message attacks based on the hardness of lattice problems over module lattices. The security notion means that an adversary having access to a signing oracle cannot produce a signature of a message whose signature he hasn't yet seen, nor produce a different signature of a message that he already saw signed. Dilithium is one of the candidate algorithms submitted to the NIST post-quantum cryptography project.


[14-Mar-19 11:28 AM] jl777c#5810
The design of Dilithium is based on the "Fiat-Shamir with Aborts" technique of Lyubashevsky which uses rejection sampling to make lattice-based Fiat-Shamir schemes compact and secure.

@Bryan_Beus I noticed two questions in current doc comments - am I correct or there are some others? 

1) ```| extracted  | <!--need this-->         | the progress which was extracted from the game by the `keystrokes` replay playback <!--Can you please provide more description? I don't yet understand it. -->                                                                                                       |```

```  "extracted": "$$$gold.288 hp.52 strength.16/16 level.6 exp.271 dl.2",``` example of output in this field - I'm not sure how describe it different way. On extract call replay of game keystrokes playing and then printing saved progress. (gold, hp, strength, character level, character experience and dungeon level on which game finished)

2)  ```   "error":null,
   "id":"jl777"
}``` 
I wonder id field in keystrokes output not contains some special information besides of jl777 reference   (because it's constant). @jl777c can correct me if I'm wrong


[16-Mar-19 02:03 AM] gcharang#6833
@Bryan_Beus 
A suggestion:

To keep the docs uptodate ; i.e., increase the frequency of merges to master, 
we can change  our workflow a bit:
I am working in my branch: gcharang
you can also create a new working branch : sid
If I am asking for reviews or additions from someone else, I will ask them to PR to gcharang branch
You can do the same with the sid branch

So from then, we can use the dev branch as a staging ground and only merge to it from the github interface.
I feel this will increase the merge rate to master thereby keeping our docs more updated


[17-Mar-19 08:04 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
There are


[17-Mar-19 08:09 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@gcharang 


I do agree that we need to merge to master more.

None of the major updates are finished yet. CC Sudoku, CC MuSig, and CC Rogue are in various stages of finishing. CC Rogue is almost done. I will finish it as soon as I start work tomorrow (Monday), and can push it to master then.

The kind of changes that would be good to push faster are smaller changes, like grammar fixes and individual rpc updates/additions. 

For that, what the simplest solution is to just remove the references from the `.config` file to the unfinished docs, make a commit, push to master, and then replace references. 

If that sounds sufficient to you, then I'll do that once or twice a week.


[17-Mar-19 08:12 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
In general, we need to change the approach to tech docs altogether. 

The MM2 docs happened very quickly. From the time Artem provided them to me to the time they were finished was less than a week. You can see on the temporary MM2 docs website here that we finished more content than CC MuSig, CC Rogue, and CC Sudoku combined.

[17-Mar-19 08:24 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
But the CC MuSig, CC Rogue, and CC Sudoku docs are taking far more time. We are passing things back and forth too much.

I am serving in the capacity of an editor. I'm not a tester nor a coder, and therefore I don't know how features function, and though I do try to test as much as I can, ultimately, I do not have the time available to learn every feature to the point where I can make the initial effort to explain it. 

When the docs that I receive as a starting point don't have all the information (tables, descriptions for each property, rpcs, installation instructions, etc), it takes me two or three times longer to find the answers and assemble them when compared with someone who is already testing/building these products.  

I don't have the test environment set up locally to test all the new software features, and attempting to go that route has cost me a lot of time. Earlier this year, I lost a ton of time due to an error in the `gcc` step of the installation process. And in the process I was told that I need to update my version of Linux from 17.10 to 18.10. That took a lot of time, and most of it was my personal (unpaid) time.


[17-Mar-19 08:24 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
For this reason, if at any point in time I get lost while trying to use the software, I stop testing and just work with the written content I have, and don't worry anymore about whether I can see the results on screen. I have to rely on the people for whom it's already working.

My job in regards to technical documentation is just to make sure that the information is presented clearly and with consistent voice/grammar/style, so that when the marketing team presents our technology to our partners, we have bright, shiny technical docs that are clear and easy to follow, and leave a feeling of professionalism with our potential enterprise partnerships. 

Beyond that, I have other duties in the marketing team that need doing, and for which I can find little time.

Last week, I was asked to propose some solutions for how I can speed things up for my part.


[17-Mar-19 08:25 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
What I think I can do to try to speed things up is to make a series of templates that provide specific, step-by-step instructions to follow when making the initial documentation.


[17-Mar-19 08:26 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
It will explain the format that we're following for whatever relevant content it is, and it will provide dummy templates that can be filled in with the existing format and repeated content.


[17-Mar-19 08:26 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
From there, we'll pass it off to whomever is building the product to fill in, or to whomever the coder/builder/developer delegates to fill it in.


[17-Mar-19 08:27 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I can help make things look and sound nice after it's filled in, but I won't start until I'm sure I have all the necessary information.

tony has also suggested putting together a table showcasing missing information.


[17-Mar-19 08:28 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I think this is a good idea. 

We could extend that idea to also show who is the current "hot potato" holder of a documentation effort.


[17-Mar-19 08:29 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
So, if one of us has finished our task and has passed it off to someone else, we should mark the "hot potato" holder as being the person who is supposed to review or contribute content.


[17-Mar-19 08:29 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442

Excellent.

For docs.komodoplatform.com, you can put it up wherever Gcharang and Shossain think best. 

It does not matter if the format matches there.


[17-Mar-19 09:24 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
When it comes time to put it on developers.komodoplatform.com, hopefully by then I will have some templates that ensure that for each rpc/table/description/etc., we have all the information already present before we begin formatting and organizing.


[17-Mar-19 09:24 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Does that work okay?


[17-Mar-19 09:26 PM] Alright#0419
many of the new CCs will need docs directed at UI devs as they're almost unusable from a end user's perspective without some kind of UI


[17-Mar-19 09:27 PM] Alright#0419
look at the paste, do you expect users to do all that for each Qsend? No, this is something a UI would handle. Docs for Musig and Rogue are the same situation as well


[17-Mar-19 09:28 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Since you expect the docs to continue growing, why don't we avoid putting Dilithium up on developers.komodoplatform.com until the docs are settled?

This is a very good idea.

I do have the development environment setup and have tested most of our CC. And as my main job is to create technical documentation that is usable, whenever you find missing tables/rpcs/relevant info missing, please pass it on to me. I can either fill those in myself or ask tony/alright/developer for the details.

This way, you can make them presentable and can have more time for the actual marketing side duties.

[18-Mar-19 07:33 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@gcharang 

Okay, I will defer to you more often for missing information.

I'm using 18.10 because I spoke with some Ubuntu distro developers who warned against using 18.04 for anything other than server usage. They say that for desktop/laptop usage, it's best to keep up with the latest, as staying behind causes more issues in the long run. 

For any testing I do, I have a VPS now with 18.04. When I need to install Komodo software for testing, I do it there.

I'll make the templates for formatting this week.

then it's ok, I was only thinking of documenting komodo when I said 18.04.
 as you can see in the picture, 18.10 will be deprecated in July 2019 and dependencies will change making it a pain to compile komodo

[18-Mar-19 01:49 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Just some more rambling thoughts:

At some point, it may be nice to change the name of the docs.komodoplatform.com website to doc-prototypes.komodoplatform.com 

That way, it can receive more attention without being confusing as to why it exists.

We are a small company, with a small team, and our resources (the number of team members we have to work on any given endeavor) is more limited than what we might find in our competitors.

Amazon (not a competitor, but a good example) would have a whole department dedicated to nothing but tech docs. Or, each project/team of developers would have a tech doc expert who would be involved in the creative process, taking notes along the way to ensure that their final doc assembly would be well informed.

We don't have those resources.

The developers.komodoplatform.com website may not be able to keep up with the latest-and-greatest version of Komodo. It may only be updated once a month or so. 

In general, the developers.komodoplatform.com website is more about the paint job, and less about the engine. 

We want the customer to buy. They won't know all the details of the Komodo engine for many months. They may not learn it all ever. We just want them to buy. And seeing pretty, clean docs is part of the selling point. 

If it's not 100% up-to-date, I personally am okay with that, so long as docs.komodoplatform.com is up to date. 

what do you think?


[18-Mar-19 01:49 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@TonyL 
Sure, no worries.


[18-Mar-19 01:57 PM] TonyL#3577
Personally I think that we mixed user manual with dev-documentation right now so purpose of this documentation is not very clear.
If it's documentation for developers - no need to hurry for software is permanenrly changing still (rogue or gateways let's say). Anyway - right now nobody build things on it so we have time to test things and prepare actual documentation for stable version.
For demonstration quite simple doc with short RPC calls descr and few examples is enough imo - but it should correct documentation anyway. 
Imo no need to publish some beta version of doc with not correct things which will not work / will form not correct vision when you read and try to follow.


[18-Mar-19 01:59 PM] TonyL#3577
To create correct example enough just to try thing usage from point A (program flow start) to point B (program result) and then describe/document this experience steps


[18-Mar-19 02:00 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
For docs.komodoplatform.com, this is perfectly fine.


[18-Mar-19 02:00 PM] TonyL#3577
If expected point B  is reached intermideate steps apriori will be correct


[18-Mar-19 02:00 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
And it doesn't need me to edit it, either.


[18-Mar-19 02:00 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I think we did the CC Rogue docs for developers.komodoplatform.com too early, and possibly same for CC Sudoku.

I'm not sure about CC MuSig.


[18-Mar-19 02:04 PM] TonyL#3577
I think we just have to work as a team on it: initially people who testing should write down some guideline - then you should try to follow these steps and enlarge this non-technical writer guideline with necessary from your point of view details. If there are not enough details in initial steps-to-follow guideline - you can request more information / ask for help and advice. Thats how I see such flow.
Otherwiese creating the gap between what we have and what is written


[18-Mar-19 02:07 PM] TonyL#3577
It like a if I'll need to write a research about `Investigation of the reaction D(4He, γ)6Li at ultralow energies`
If I'll not try this reaction my reaserch will not be published in magazine most probably


[18-Mar-19 02:10 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm fine with that. 

Gcharang would then be in charge of assembling RPC method descriptions/tables/examples, and I would only edit them afterwards for grammar/voice, when necessary.

In an ideal situation, my only responsibility should be writing the introductory/marketing content that goes before RPC calls. For example, explaining what CryptoConditions is, or what an atomic swap is, and why the reader should care. 

We have tried to hire an editor, someone who has an English degree and a few years experience as a technical writer. This person would then be the editor for voice/styling/grammar of the RPC calls, I would spend time elsewhere.

Unfortunately, each round of hiring we have attempted has not resulted in qualified candidates, so I'm filling in for the foreseeable future. 

Anyhow, hope that helps clarify things. 

I do have a good computer setup, by the way. I know I mentioned I "don't have the environment," but that doesn't mean hardware.

It's more referring to the fact that when I come into a coding/testing environment that is already established, the developers often don't realize what's missing for a normal user to use the product.

Sorry for wall of text. If shortly summarize my point I think that doc-writers should be QA a little bit and QA should be a little bit doc-writers to make it work


[18-Mar-19 02:12 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
For example, when I went to write MM2 docs, I followed/tested all existing material, until I got the point of actually performing an atomic swap.

I was unable to connect with a Bob node.

I could wait (possibly for days) until one of the developers was able to help me connect to the bob node, but this would dramatically increase the amount of time it takes to get the docs written.

@TonyL 

I don't mind doing some testing. I do what I can. My point is that I can't let it become a bottleneck.


[18-Mar-19 02:12 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
If I get stranded, I have to keep being productive, and that means switching tasks.

I let Artem know that I couldn't connect, and from there I have not once launched the MM2 software.


[18-Mar-19 02:12 PM] TonyL#3577
MM2 in early closed beta - it's normal that there are bugs


[18-Mar-19 02:13 PM] TonyL#3577
Rogue don't have stable release as well


[18-Mar-19 02:13 PM] TonyL#3577
Gateways are under testing


[18-Mar-19 02:13 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Right.

My point is, if I get stranded, I can't wait. I have to keep moving, or else I wind up stymied and wasting company time. 

Steve, my supervisor, has asked me to find ways to spend less time here, so these are the parameters I have to work within.


[18-Mar-19 02:13 PM] TonyL#3577
If you trying and finding a bug - thats great, not bad


[18-Mar-19 02:14 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I agree, but I can only do so much. Does that make sense?


[18-Mar-19 02:14 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
If I find a bug that stops my progress, I have to move on to another task. I can't wait for the bug to be fixed.


[18-Mar-19 02:14 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I try to let people know that I found one, and then I move on without the software.


[18-Mar-19 02:15 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
With Rogue, I went through all the installation procedure, and then I searched for a way to launch the game, didn't find one, I asked around in one of the channels and no one was present, and so I just moved on with what I have.


[18-Mar-19 02:15 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
If I waited, it could be 24 hours before I could resume work.


[18-Mar-19 02:15 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
This is what I mean when I say, "I don't have the environment."

The timezone difference between me and whomever it is that has the answers is sometimes an issue, sometimes not.

[18-Mar-19 02:20 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I agree.

I appreciate all the hard work that is going on here.

And thank you, James for the encouragement. It is good to hear.


[18-Mar-19 02:23 PM] jl777c#5810
in my memory the only thing I used to hear was that our docs were not so good, or nonexistent. now I am regularly hearing how good they are, so it is a total transformation


[18-Mar-19 02:23 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
oh good


[18-Mar-19 02:23 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, it's quite hard task to document software which on stage when breaking/changing few times per day
`, and then I searched for a way to launch the game, didn't find one, I asked around in one of the channels and no one was present` feel free DM me next time if I'm participating in testing - I'm always glad to help with explanations


[18-Mar-19 02:25 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I appreciate it. @TonyL 

And when I talked with steve over Voice, I mentioned how easy it is to work with you.

Our issue here is team process.

The timezone issue is still a problem. If I post a question and don't hear back for hours, it stymies my progress. I do try to let people know, but once I get "lost" in the testing process, I just move forward. 

Anyhow, as Gcharang and I have discussed, I am going to try to scale back my involvement with creating the initial documentation, and I will provide templates sometime this week to help make this go smoother.

Yes, have to reduce gaps and communicate more, exchange knowledge and aim for result together and I'm sure it would be super great points to bring our tech to masses. 
Btw I have same feeling sometimes because of timezone. That feeling when you already going to sleep but teammates just woke up  😃

@Bryan_Beus could we please keep the URL? Maybe just slap a big ole "GO TO developers.komodoplatform.com INSTEAD" on top of it


[18-Mar-19 04:44 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
oh, I don't think we're all that serious about changing it. I just threw it out as an idea.

I use docs there every day, would really mess with my work flow to begin with


[18-Mar-19 04:44 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
we don't have docs.komodoplatform.com listed anywhere on the website


[18-Mar-19 04:45 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
it's only for interal/beta usage


[18-Mar-19 04:45 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
it's fine for now.

We could easily just put something in the sidebar or at the top that states that this is a testing ground for docs/dev

[18-Mar-19 05:48 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
developers.kp should just be accurate. It won't contain everything, but if something on it is inaccurate, then we need to change it. 

I should say, it won't be as comprehensive.


[18-Mar-19 05:48 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442

[18-Mar-19 05:57 PM] Alright#0419
My understanding was that i no longer needed to maintain my docs on docs.komodoplatform.com as it was being phased out


[18-Mar-19 05:57 PM] Alright#0419
this is why I made such an effort to get the assetchain parameters docs on developers.komodoplatform.com nice and shiny


[18-Mar-19 05:59 PM] Alright#0419
I really don't understand the purpose of developers.komodoplatform.com if we have more technical docs at docs.komodoplatform.com


[18-Mar-19 05:59 PM] Alright#0419
the one targeted at new users is called *developers*.komodoplatform.com ?


[18-Mar-19 06:00 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442

it goes to developers.komodoplatform.com


[18-Mar-19 06:00 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
there is no listing that I am aware of that goes to docs.komodoplatform.com


[18-Mar-19 06:00 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
the latter is for internal and initial-effort purposes


[18-Mar-19 06:01 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
we had talked about phasing it out, but it's never going to happen. We don't have time to move everything to developers.komodoplatform.com


[18-Mar-19 06:01 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
developers is for customers

docs is for us and for  very brave customers

[18-Mar-19 06:01 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
nope


[18-Mar-19 06:02 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
the initial effort and internal docs must be done either way


[18-Mar-19 06:03 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
moving everything to developers.komodoplatform.com would take eons. We don't have the resources.

Developers is for well crafted, thoroughly edited, clear, and accurate docs. Adding documentation to developers is a large and time-consuming effort. It's a pretty paint job for the wary and indecisive customer.

docs.komodoplatform.com can be behind or ahead. It can be written by someone who doesn't have command of the English language. It is for "prototypes", hence the name I suggested.


[18-Mar-19 06:04 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Having internal docs  that are not as heavily edited saves work, if anything.


[18-Mar-19 06:04 PM] Alright#0419
Do i need to continue to maintain the assetchain params doc on docs.komodoplatform.com ?


[18-Mar-19 06:04 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Not really.


[18-Mar-19 06:05 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
But if you are experimenting with a new asset chain param, you should use docs.komodoplatform.com until you are certain development on it has ceased.


[18-Mar-19 06:05 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
In general, i would like to avoid experimental features on developers.komodoplatform.com


[18-Mar-19 06:06 PM] Alright#0419
development never ceases on anything


[18-Mar-19 06:07 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Yes it does. There are loads of commands on developers.komodoplatform.com that are no longer touched.


[18-Mar-19 06:07 PM] Alright#0419
until they are


[18-Mar-19 06:07 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
And when they are, we will update. But they are generally stable, and that is what matters.


[18-Mar-19 06:07 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Please, let's not get into semantics.


[18-Mar-19 06:08 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
If you want, you can remove all asset chain params from docs.komodoplatform.com that are now documented on developers.komodoplatform.com


[18-Mar-19 06:09 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
And then save whatever file on docs.komodoplatform.com for new asset chain params that are in heavy development stages.

it's up to you. I don't follow docs.komodoplatform.com at all. I'm just saying, if you want, you can remove everything on docs.komodoplatform.com that is already on developers...


[18-Mar-19 06:11 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
sure, that is fine


[18-Mar-19 06:11 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Whatever works for you.


[18-Mar-19 06:13 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
The point is, getting stuff to a point where a customer would appreciate these docs is a very, very time-consuming effort. 

We need two modes: "I don't care if it's pretty, and I don't care how many people or who wants to read it. I just care that it's documented." 

^ That is for docs.komodo....

mode two: "These documents could be looked at by a very promising, high-level enterprise partnership. I should make sure that they are as clean and organized as possible, so they are impressed with the Komodo team's professionalism."

^ That is for developers.komodo....


[18-Mar-19 06:13 PM] Alright#0419
I don't think we should keep experimental features off of developers.komodoplatform.com


[18-Mar-19 06:13 PM] Alright#0419
it would make sense to keep them off newdevelopers.komodoplatform.com 😛


[18-Mar-19 06:14 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ya, for now, we don't have a "newdevelopers" sub... but that would be very nice.


[18-Mar-19 06:14 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
If we had more teammates, but we are all quite strapped.


[18-Mar-19 06:14 PM] Alright#0419
I don't want to have to add experimental features to docs.komodoplatform.com only to have to add them later to developers.komodoplatform.com


[18-Mar-19 06:15 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
the primary difference is that you have to use copy/paste at least once.


[18-Mar-19 06:15 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Beyond that, I'm not aware of any work that is exepcted of you that would not be expected if we were to eliminate docs.komodo....


[18-Mar-19 06:16 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I guess pushing to github counts... but that's really not a whole lot of work? And the time savings are enormous, including for you, because you don't have to have an editor while experimenting/testing/staging on docs.komodo...., so no hand offs to gcharang or to me.


[18-Mar-19 06:17 PM] Alright#0419
what is rationale behind keeping experimental features off of developers.komodoplatform.com


[18-Mar-19 06:17 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
time


[18-Mar-19 06:18 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
It is very time-consuming to get things prepared for customers, so that when they see them, they tell JL, "These look great!"

That does not happen quickly. It takes many, many passes at the docs, each time rewriting, rephrasing, and trying to condense and homogenize as much formatting/organization as possible, so that people never feel lost.


[18-Mar-19 06:18 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I spend many hours reviewing everything, and I re-read things dozens of times.

"All writing is re-writing." -- Ernest Hemmingway


[18-Mar-19 06:20 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I have probably re-read the CC Rogue docs no less than 15 times, start to finish, just for the sake of trying to make sure I didn't miss anything.


[18-Mar-19 06:23 PM] Alright#0419
what makes an "experimental feature" vs a "feature"


[18-Mar-19 06:23 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
That's your call. You = you + the rest of the tech team


[18-Mar-19 06:23 PM] Alright#0419
IMO, it would be more people using it


[18-Mar-19 06:23 PM] Alright#0419
if we don't show them they can use it, they won't


[18-Mar-19 06:24 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
And if we show them stuff that doesn't work, they won't want to work with us.

You and the rest of the tech team have to decide when something should be pushed to developers.komod....

Just keep in mind, it frequently takes a few weeks to get another push to master on developers.komodo....


[18-Mar-19 06:24 PM] Alright#0419
I can tell you that the rewards CC seems solid, but we won't really know for sure until it's put into production


[18-Mar-19 06:25 PM] Alright#0419
should we remove the docs for it?


[18-Mar-19 06:25 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
If you worry that during the next 3 or so weeks (as a general guideline, not a hard fast rules) things could change and someone could get frustrated, then I would say don't start the process of getting it to developers.komodo...


[18-Mar-19 06:25 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
It's already on developers.komodo.... ?


[18-Mar-19 06:25 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I don't think we need to remove anything. 

I'm speaking about process going forward.


[18-Mar-19 06:26 PM] Alright#0419
my point is that "experimental features" don't truly become "features" until someone actually uses them


[18-Mar-19 06:26 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
If something is inaccurate and a customer could get frustrated, please let me know asap. That is a different story. 

developers.komodo... is there to create a pleasant customer experience. If something is not in line with that, we will try to fix asap.


[18-Mar-19 06:27 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
> my point is that "experimental features" don't truly become "features" until someone actually uses them

Again, if it's going to change within the next three weeks or so weeks, generally speaking, then it's probably not time yet for developers.komodo....

If it's at least settled for the next month or so, then it's probably ready.

Things that are in testing are fine to share on Discord with our community, I assume. 

And you can document however you like on docs.komodo....


[18-Mar-19 06:31 PM] Alright#0419

? 🤔

@Mylo 

I'm not aware of anything that's suggesting a migration.

At least, that's what I thought.


[18-Mar-19 06:55 PM] Mylo#8306
Can rename docs to docs-old, and docs can become the developers site, as long as we have sitemap to coordinate url forwarding

Ok

anyone can do whatever they want there.

It is a "Sidd free zone."

I just scrolled up, docs = fresh unmitigated audacity, developers = streamlined for your convenience


[18-Mar-19 06:57 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Once some new feature is relatively settled, we then start bringing it to developers.komdo....

The developers.komodo... website is meant to be nice and orderly. It takes a lot of time to get it there, and changes are harder to make.


[18-Mar-19 06:58 PM] Mylo#8306

@Bryan_Beus take for example the nk parameter Joker is working on right now

where should i begin to document this?


[18-Mar-19 07:00 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
What is it?


[18-Mar-19 07:00 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
asset chain parameter?


[18-Mar-19 07:00 PM] Alright#0419
equihash n k params

As in, a launch parameter?


[18-Mar-19 07:00 PM] Alright#0419
it is experimental. It will be until someone uses it for real


[18-Mar-19 07:00 PM] Alright#0419

I would do all the initial effort for your work on docs.komodoplatform.com


[18-Mar-19 07:01 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
When the docs are reasonably settled, gcharang and I will have some templates for you to fill out, to help you make sure you have all your ducks in a row

(I'm making the templates this week)


[18-Mar-19 07:01 PM] Alright#0419
that means first updating that document with all the new ones it doesn't have


[18-Mar-19 07:02 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Once you fill out all the templates, then we'll start bringing it to developers.k....

then working on it there


[18-Mar-19 07:02 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Or, you could delete stuff you don't want to manage.


[18-Mar-19 07:02 PM] Alright#0419
then redoing all the formatting and submitting it to developers.komodoplatform.com, then it taking days/weeks to get to master


[18-Mar-19 07:02 PM] Alright#0419
or I can submit it directly to developers.komodoplatform.com and simply label it "experimental"


[18-Mar-19 07:02 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
The latter, no.

You may use docs.komodo.... as an initial place that is somewhat public for your initial efforts, if you want.

Or you may do anything else. You can make your own website, if you want.

When you have all the information ironed out so that you don't expect changes within the next few weeks, then you come to developers.komodo....

That's it.

n and k is pretty simple change really, once its tested with some GPU miners and a pool to make sure it works..... then its done. 😃


[18-Mar-19 07:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
So basically, as long as it not expected to change, like what RPCs and ac_params you use to launch it/use it then is fine to go to your docs site? 
Because bug fixes may or may not change RPC... ac_params.... definatly not... but behaviour may change after hard testing.


[18-Mar-19 07:09 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I don't understand your last sentence.

like an ac param ... the input wouldnt be excpected to change with bug fixes, but what it does may slightly change....


[18-Mar-19 07:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
in the case of n and k... the behaviour is defined.... but not all params would work...


[18-Mar-19 07:11 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
The idea is, if you don't expect the docs to change (yes, we know that something may still change, but you at least don't EXPECT it to change), then it should be ready.

Yes, I know bugs will arise. Yes, I know creativity will occur later.

In general, when you think it's "about done for now," <-- you would say that phrase when talking to someone over the phone about it -- that is the time when it's ready to start making it available to customers.

Ya, don't worry about that.

I'm not trying to slow you down. You just do you when it comes to coding.

The problem is, writing polished docs that make people say "Love the docs!" <-- that is very, very time consuming.

We don't want to consume that company time until we're ready.

Anyhow, I really don't know why this is so complicated. 

I'm going to copy/paste a bunch of phrases in here that I've said a dozen times now.

Alright's question:

"you'll have me maintain 2 separate docs instead of adding that line to your's?"

Sidd's response:

"You can feel free to ignore docs.komodo... and only take notes locally on your machine.
I don't care."

 > "you're hyper focused on writing style"

Here is what JL said earlier:

"whatever the process has been, i keep hearing how good the new docs are!"

^ This comes from Sidd's "hyper focus on writing style"

Another statement from JL:

"in my memory the only thing I used to hear was that our docs were not so good, or nonexistent. now I am regularly hearing how good they are, so it is a total transformation"

^ Again, that comes from focus on writing style.

Question from Alright;

"I don't understand why we cannot just put a warning "this is an experimental feature"

Sidd's response:

"If you don't expect it to change within the next few weeks, and if you don't see an emergency for a customer occurring while you wait for me to fix a needed change (which may or may not happen quickly), then it doesn't matter."


[18-Mar-19 07:30 PM] Alright#0419
As I understood it, we were phasing out docs.komodoplatform.com. Since then, I've been focused on keeping developers.komodoplatform.com up to date and accurate. Now I'm told I must continue to work on the thing I left behind two months ago because you can't add "this is an experimental feature. Use it at your own risk." to the developers.komodoplatform.com doc

@Alright @Bryan_Beus 
Wow! so much happened since I went to sleep. 

As I can see the situation, the root of the conflict is docs.kp is written in `rst` and developers.kp is in `md`
This is what is making alright's work of keeping assetchains doc double

The thing that isn't being communicated between us:

Sidd says:

```
marketing won't link docs.kp in the website, won't point anyone to it, wants it to be a internal website
but refuses to add "eaperimental" ones to developers.kp and says it will be 1 month behind development
```
so how are we going to test things and point our community or other developers to docs that work and are relevant?
Forget about enterprise 1 second and think about a new developer joining our discord and wants to try a new feature thats been tweeted about, what should he be shown?

The solution I can see is that I take a week and convert the docs.kp to use markdown + vuepress(or some other display framework) 
that way testers and devs can use the uptodate docs there and sidd can use the md docs there for developers.kp without much additional effort

I will start that work if and when I receive explicit go ahead from the team

> so how are we going to test things and point our community or other developers to docs that work and are relevant? Forget about enterprise 1 second and think about a new developer joining our discord and wants to try a new feature thats been tweeted about, what should he be shown?

A new feature should not be tweeted about until it's "about done."

We are trying with our amazing PR agency to stop releasing information before marketing can actually develop a plan to market it.


[18-Mar-19 09:45 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Our PR team has complained about this to us many times -- in almost every call.


[18-Mar-19 09:45 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
We are paying them to help us, and then team members leak information about exciting new features before the marketing team and PR agency can build up hype for it.


[18-Mar-19 09:46 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Have you ever noticed that Apple computers does not talk about stuff until it is "finished"?


[18-Mar-19 09:48 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Watch the very first iPhone release with Steve Jobs. 

I just so happened to be lucky enough to be livestreaming that one when I was in college. 

I had no idea how cool that keynote speech would be.

Making that first iPhone took 10 years in the making.

The way it was marketed was BRILLIANT.

While we are a different company and have different agendas compared to Apple, in general, it is NOT advantageous to marketing for the community to know everything.

There's nothing to be excited about.

We don't need to go 100% silent. I'm not suggesting that.

But the marketing team and our PR agency actually need every team member to stop announcing things immediately.

It inhibits our ability to do our job of building up excitement.

> How do you test it properly if nobody uses it ?

I'm not suggesting radio silence on everything, so please don't misunderstand.

I'm just saying: If it doesn't go to developers.komodoplatform.com immediately and it is not mission critical, that often is okay.

Discretion and sound judgement is normal>

Again, developers.komodoplatform.com is about impressing people.

We want people telling our team, "Wow, I love these docs!"

We did not get that response with the old method.

We get it with the new one. 

This is helping us with big projects that marketing and business development are working on -- things that can help Komodo win the day from a marketing perspective. We hope you can support us in this endeavor.

Im not sure exactly what was going on here... I just told him to to nly sumbit to the developers on and ignore the old one ....


[18-Mar-19 09:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
then he said he was goign to do the opposite of that

🤷


[18-Mar-19 09:54 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Alright wants to do things his own way.

I have no asked him to use docs.komodoplatform.com 

It is there for him if he wants it, and I have mentioned it only to give him an option he can consider when posting his notes/writings in a public place.


[18-Mar-19 09:54 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
The final result will eventually be pushed to developers.komodoplatform.com, and that is all that my job concerns.


[18-Mar-19 09:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
I need people to use my stuff  so that it gets tested properly. There is only so far you can test thing son your own or even with LABS, once large amounts of users start to happen bugs are exposed.


[18-Mar-19 09:55 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Right, that makes sense.


[18-Mar-19 09:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
So post the docs where ppl will seee thema nd screw the rest of ti IMO


[18-Mar-19 09:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think this is also what your saying ...


[18-Mar-19 09:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
but there will be a delay until its been processed


[18-Mar-19 09:56 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
An option you can consider is to use (I'm not asking you to, but you can if you want) .....

.... is to use docs.komodoplatform.com 

Post this in discord. Share it with people in the immediate community.

Once you would say  these words, "Okay, I'm about done, I need to move this into greater public perception or I can't go any further," that is the time to start getting things prepped for developers.komodo....


[18-Mar-19 09:57 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
The issue with developers is that it MUST, MUST, MUST be well organized and clean. If it is not well organized and clean, it runs the risk of ruining marketing endeavors. 

From a writing perspective, it is not a "work in progress"


[18-Mar-19 09:57 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
It is a finished product.


[18-Mar-19 09:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
I dont generally do it, I just amke stuff and leave that to Alright, but I think hes already pretty far behind on docs to what I have added lately


[18-Mar-19 09:57 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
This takes a TON of my time, and Steve has asked that I please don't spend so much time here, while maintinaing the writing-style quality.


[18-Mar-19 09:58 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Yes, I think you and I are on the same page, blackjok3r.

It's not that we're asking for radio silence. We're not. But if things take a little longer to get to developers.komodo...., that is okay, because that site is not about being right-up-to-the-minute with every last detail.

Rather, it is about making sure that was is there, is clean, polished, and professional, so that people tell us, "Good job with the docs!"


[18-Mar-19 10:00 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
So, you are welcome to post on other websites (that marketing is not promoting) to gather feedback and to get users trying things out. 

I can see that this is a part of your process, and my feedback is making it sound like I'm trying to change the way you work. I'm sorry that I lack the vocabulary to know how to say things in a better way. I'm doing the best I can.


[18-Mar-19 10:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think then Gcharangs idea is good then if both sites are in the same format... it can be copy psted over? and you can clean it up


[18-Mar-19 10:00 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Exactly.


[18-Mar-19 10:01 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I think so too. I didn't want to dump that on gcharang, because it is not a small amount of work, and I don't have time to do it.

It is a very noble effort of him, and I really appreciate it.


[18-Mar-19 10:02 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Once things are all in .md, I don't know what left there is to say.

Moving something from docs.komodoplatform.com to developers.komodoplatform.com is just a copy/paste command.

I will have some templates that will try to give the tester/developer an idea of what is expected before starting the transfer. But those must be done no matter what website/format the initial effort is done in, whether by Alright, Gcharang, or anybody else.


[18-Mar-19 10:02 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Hope that makes sense.


[18-Mar-19 10:19 PM] gcharang#6833
```
 I think so too. I didn't want to dump that on gcharang, because it is not a small amount of work, and I don't have time to do it.
```

there are scripts that do the majority of conversion from rst to md.
The only parts leftover will be some of the syntax that rst understands and md doesn't
those will be where I will have to edit by hand

I will start doing it when there isn't any other important task. Expect it will take atleast 1 week

@Bryan_Beus In this section http://kmdmmdocs.northpole.red/basic-docs/atomic-swap-dex/installing-komodo-dex.html#build-mm2 the directory is:  `~/SuperNET/target/debug/mm2`

but in http://kmdmmdocs.northpole.red/basic-docs/atomic-swap-dex/dex-walkthrough.html#setting-up-the-coin-list
it is: `~/KomodoPlatform/target/debug` there seems to be some difference?

[19-Mar-19 01:07 AM] Mylo#8306
staging lives in a `dev` branch of the docs.   then the lovely formatting can be merged to master.
nothing should be commited to master - it's asking for stress/trouble unnecessarily at the most inopportune time in the future.

@gcharang 

For some reason, when I did a git diff after your last pull request, I did not see all the changes you made to the komodo api docs.

I must have made a mistake with the way I am using git.

I am working to fix it now. Just fyi.

What I mean to say is that I merged your pull request and then I did a git diff of the log from before the merge to see what had changed so that I could look for things that needed editing and read your comments.

Unfortunately, I seem to have only got a partial result with my git diff command. It only showed me changes in CC docs, not in Komodo API. 

I must have done something wrong with my git diff.

I noticed the many changes you made this morning when I merged `dev` into `mm` and saw a large list of updated files.

https://github.com/KMDLabs/pos64staker/blob/restart/dildoc

I've been working on this lately. It's definitely unfinished, but before I continue, I'd like to do the formatting off it. I notice that the CC docs on developers.komodoplatform.com don't match this style. It's more a walkthrough than a description of each rpc command. I need to know if I should be formatting this for docs.komodoplatform.com or developers.komodoplatform.com. I'd rather do it for the developers.komodoplatform.com site, but I'm not sure it fits along side the other docs. Should I continue with this doc then create a separate one that is a description of each rpc command?

I can do the dilithium rpc commands doc for developers.kp, but I'm wondering if it should be separate from this walkthrough

and will we put this walkthrough on developers.kp once it's touched up


[20-Mar-19 01:05 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I recommend resolving these issues with @gcharang 

In short: developers.komodoplatform.com is the final goal.

How you get there is up to you.

Please work with gcharang to make sure that you have all necessary information.

Once both you and he are certain that all information is provided, I will step in and make sure that everything is formatted nicely.

ok, just one more thing, the walkthrough style of doc, is this acceptable for developers.kp?

Yes, it is perfect.


[20-Mar-19 01:09 PM] Alright#0419
Oh and did we figure out a way to do collapsible text?


[20-Mar-19 01:09 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
We did, but we haven't had time to implement it yet.


[20-Mar-19 01:10 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I don't want to implement it until we have time to do it for all docs.

Consistency is important. We do not want one section to be formatted in one way (i.e. with "Click here to expand buttons") and one section formatted in another. 

If Gcharang has space on his to-do list to take a look at adding this, that's something to consider, but he may be backed up with other requests.


[20-Mar-19 01:47 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442

This is so that we don't have to maintain two formats of the same doc

 the component itself is in `./.vuepress/components`

[21-Mar-19 03:57 AM] Alright#0419
I believe that's what this is supposed to be? User could always take komodod from an Agama build, but that's kind of annoying to explain


[21-Mar-19 03:57 AM] jl777c#5810
might be annoying, but that would eliminate the need to keep the binaries up to date. so just an OS specific description of how to install Agama and find the prebuild executables


[21-Mar-19 04:06 AM] Alright#0419
thought maybe I could open the .exe as an archive. I don't have a windows machine, not sure what path komodo/komodo-cli would be on windows

@jl777c 

Can you help me understand which part of the documentation is incomplete?

We have a few things for people wishing to build/install asset chains.

As Alright mentioned, here is the basic `komodod` installation method:

https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/installations/basic-instructions.html#installing-basic-komodo-software

It includes a link to the launch parameters for existing asset chains that do not have dynamic CC modules.

To create an asset chain from scratch, we have this here:

https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/installations/creating-asset-chains.html#creating-a-new-asset-chain

For each dynamic-CC asset chain that we have chosen to support with documentation, such as ROGUE, we have instructions on how to install in the CC module's documentation:

https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/cryptoconditions/cc-rogue.html#installation

[21-Mar-19 09:12 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
What else needs to be added? Let me know and @gcharang and I will see to it. Thank you.


[21-Mar-19 09:13 AM] jl777c#5810
I think all the info is there, the issue is that the pages people go to who want to make their own assetchain doesnt have prominent links to the required info


[21-Mar-19 09:13 AM] jl777c#5810
and also where is the binaries FSM release, which is needed to test the newest CC


[21-Mar-19 09:14 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Are they going to the documentation on the website?


[21-Mar-19 09:14 AM] jl777c#5810
so maybe this is a main website issue more than anything else


[21-Mar-19 09:14 AM] jl777c#5810
they cant find the documentation


[21-Mar-19 09:14 AM] jl777c#5810
that exists


[21-Mar-19 09:14 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
The link path is this:

> Develop (navbar) > Developer Documentation > Doc Landing Page > Installation and Setup > Asset Chain Creation


[21-Mar-19 09:14 AM] jl777c#5810
or they have to dig around, ask people, etc. which will lose majority of people


[21-Mar-19 09:14 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
We are discussing ways to cut out Doc Landing Page with our new designers.


[21-Mar-19 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
there are big buttons about making your own assetchain, but from clicking on that to finding the -ac_params is many clicks


[21-Mar-19 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
each click will lose 50%+ of people


[21-Mar-19 09:15 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
We could cut 

> Develop (navbar) > Developer Documentation

and make it just

> Documentation


[21-Mar-19 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
now we have excellent docs, we need to pave the road for people to find those docs


[21-Mar-19 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
make it easy to find


[21-Mar-19 09:15 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Okay, I will let Steve know. 

This may be something for IBN to address. They have not had time to look at documentation much. 

We added it after the fact.


[21-Mar-19 09:16 AM] jl777c#5810
my guess is if you ask someone to find the ac_params and how to launch assetchain page without using google... i wonder how many would be able to find it


[21-Mar-19 09:16 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess this is not a docs problem


[21-Mar-19 09:16 AM] jl777c#5810
but it is a shame to be making it hard to find the excellent docs


[21-Mar-19 09:17 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I try to keep the sidebar as concise as I can make it. I trim down everything that I receive. I can trim down more.

We have it set to a max of two-depth levels, to make sure that we don't go crazy with the information architecture.


[21-Mar-19 09:19 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'll discuss with IBN and let them know.

We may need to make a large,

"GET STARTED" button on the landing page, and then have a separate section that walks people through in a targeted tutorial.

The targeted tutorial would let people know where they can find the docs later.


[21-Mar-19 09:20 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, a bypass that goes directly to the docs for starting an assetchain would be the quick fix


[21-Mar-19 09:20 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Okay.

[22-Mar-19 01:38 AM] Mylo#8306
@jl777c in the past, i know i've been told to not link to prebuilt binaries.   otherwise, yes i agree, download agama and use the binary from there would be the easiest way to get started with komodo.   if you're instructions are to use agama binaries, it would make it much easier for ppl to just try it out and we are on the same page.


[22-Mar-19 01:43 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, for testing it is fine

Otherwise, the solution is to have the same search box answers from developer docs of komdooplatform.com website to show on a search box on komodoplatform.com official website.

@Alright I am going through it

@Alright 

Gcharang is handling all the initial documentation creation now.

For CC modules, you can refer to the preliminary template that I made. You will see it in the pins on this channel. 

When you are ready, I'll take a look and breeze over the grammar/styling/voice. 

Thank you very much.


[26-Mar-19 04:21 AM] gcharang#6833
@Alright I've gone through the dilithium doc; it was very informative.  I haven't tested it yet, but just went through it. Will test after the conversion is done; can add it to the index as soon as a couple of things are clear.
 `CTRL + F` for FIXME in https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KomodoPlatform/Documentation/dev/docs/source/cc/contracts/dilithium/introduction.rst
1. can be linked later
2. `Follow the above guide, when you get to the ``build.sh`` step, do this instead:`; I think if a user is installing for the first time, they will need to go through the build.sh at least once before using `./makecclib`
3.  the Dilithium public key in the response and the sentence seem to be different, also the pkaddr is being refered to as the pubkey?
4. I have a small guide written, see if it is sufficient

# Access `komodod`'s JSON-RPC interface using Python

We use the package [slick-bitcoinrpc](https://github.com/barjomet/slick-bitcoinrpc)

## Installation

Installing the module `slick-bitcoinrpc` and its dependencies.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3.6 python3.6-dev python3-pip libgnutls28-dev libssl-dev
python3.6 -m pip3 install setuptools wheel slick-bitcoinrpc
```

## Usage

- Once the `Proxy` method is called the object it returns can be used to access `komodod`'s method any number of times.
- The arguments to the methods must be stringified before passing them in.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3.6

from slickrpc import Proxy

komodo = Proxy("http://{}:{}@127.0.0.1:8332".format(rpcuser, rpcpassword))
# Print the best block
print(komodo.getblock(komodo.getbestblockhash()))
# Using a CC Lib method
pubkeys = ['0225f1cbbda1a0c406bb8f6dc7a589d88b2f9e28cd4fdb3f59139f8aff1f5d270a',                      '02d3431950c2f0f9654217b6ce3d44468d3a9ca7255741767fdeee7c5ec6b47567']
print(komodo.cclib("combine", "18", str(pubkeys)))
```

@TonyL 

I can use your help on current messaging/documentation for our "Build a Custom CC Module" section.

You can read what we have here.

http://kmddevdocs.northpole.red/basic-docs/cryptoconditions/cryptoconditions-tutorial.html#introduction

You'll note that at a certain part, the documentation turns into a `(Sketch)` for not-yet-written material.

Mylo is working on creating a first pass on a tutorial to show how to build a very, very basic CC module.

Afterwards, and this is where I could use your help, if you have time, we would like to have one more section that gives a broad view of "where to go from here."

What I would like this section to be is a very basic, non-detailed description of the many parts that went into creating the Rogue module. 

You'll see a unordered list in the documentation showing what I think the many parts are.

If you could let me know what parts there are to Rogue, and what we should say to a new Custom CC Module developer to give them an idea of how to stitch together their own complicated CC module, that would be very helpful.

Is this something you would have time for?

I think getting into the vouts/vins is too much for this section anyway.

I don't follow what you mean by "black box," but if it means that a box is a piece of open-source software that the reader can then go explore, and we'll link to it, that would be good enough.

Is that right?

I'm not experienced developer and don't know C/C++ almost at all - so unlikely I'll say something interesting for this auditory 😃

    A combination with the Oracles CC module
        To learn more about the Oracles CC module, look here:

        Observe how the oracle is integrated into the Rogue Module this file here:
            File: Link
        The reader may see the oracle itself by installing the Rogue asset chain and executing an RPC to call the Oracle's oracle_txid
            Link to installation instructions for Rogue
            Link to RPC that returns oracle txid
        The reader may see the publisher that receives and publishes data by executing this call
            Link to RPC, and possibly an example of the cli command
    An implementation of this old-school Rogue softwares
        Link to Rogue software installation that we borrowed
        Link to manual
    Anything else Rogue took

@TonyL 

You don't need to worry about the tutorial part. That's the part where specific CC module stuff is explained.

I also don't know much about how CC functions, but I managed to write a first pass for the introductory sections.

The part I could use some help is the list above.

So, the vague, big parts that make up Rogue, and then links to the places where those parts can be found and explored.

Does that make sense?

Are oracles using in rogue?


[28-Mar-19 04:26 PM] TonyL#3577
Rogue using baton system to record keystrokes but I'm not sure if it the same as oraclesCC. I not understood totally what is needed to be covered in this part of doc


[28-Mar-19 04:27 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Okay. Well, the hard part for me is that I do not understand how Rogue works. 

The basic idea is to give a launching point for an experienced C/C++ developer to continue exploring further on their own, or while in communication with our community. 

The underlying idea is to create a rough outline of how we built the Rogue CC module, without going into specific details.


[28-Mar-19 04:30 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh, I see. The problem is that I do not understand underlaying parts as well - can try to wrap my head more, read source code and ask James correct questions


[28-Mar-19 04:32 PM] TonyL#3577
If "blackbox-like" descritption is enough (like a "rogue sending keystrokes each level into transactions and last keystroke have refference to previous one and previous one to previous one", "on bailout replay function playing game replay from saved keystrokes and based on it extracting game progress") I can try to write it.
I can explain how it works from user side / point of view - but can't explain how it made


[28-Mar-19 04:41 PM] TonyL#3577
Can write material how to make interface to use rogue


[28-Mar-19 04:59 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Hrm, okay. 

I'm not sure what all that entails. 

Maybe you could ask James for a little help in finding out what the big building blocks are?

I can do that, too, but since you are more familiar, maybe you'll give more insight than me? 

Let me know if you have time.

*will be.   only customcc so far with maybe a mention of faucet & reward.


[28-Mar-19 09:27 PM] Mylo#8306
@Bryan_Beus do not worry about the pedagogy for experience C++ person.   they will need some basics on transaction and validation.   customcc, faucet & rewards gives them plenty.


[28-Mar-19 09:28 PM] Mylo#8306
the "where to go from here" is the faucet, rewards CCs


[28-Mar-19 09:29 PM] Mylo#8306
all that needs to be conveyed is that CC allows  a programmer to manage application state and pass it down to the consensus+p2p model of UTXO provided by komodo.


[28-Mar-19 09:29 PM] Mylo#8306
👆


[28-Mar-19 09:30 PM] Mylo#8306
it is a very simple concept.   it just uses the existing blockchain software for doing blockchainy things in a transactional model.   blocks, transactions, addresses/pubkeys.

@gcharang can you run `sed` on these tables and change "Structure" to "Name"?    structure is type, so it's got a wrong title for it.


[29-Mar-19 01:07 AM] Mylo#8306
might be useful to run grep prior to doing sed across the whole thing, make sure "Structure" is the right "Structure" to rename.


[29-Mar-19 01:08 AM] Mylo#8306
e.g. not an instruction like, "Structure your data in a way that makes sense...."

@Bryan_Beus I was able to get rid of the "seperate style to style.styl from override.styl" message when "yarn docs:dev" is run.
I can add that to the PR if you want


[29-Mar-19 10:21 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@gcharang 

How did you do it?

I just added a `style.styl` file to the .vuepress folder, and it went away.

(The `style.styl` file is for non-override styles, and we're not making any of those for now, to keep it simple. But the file's presence helps anyway.)

We don't have any styles that we've created?


[29-Mar-19 10:32 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
We're only overriding existing styles.


[29-Mar-19 10:36 AM] gcharang#6833
ah I don't know then.
The look didn't change even after I changed it to this
and 
there was this in the docs under override.styl:
```
There are a few color variables you can tweak:

// showing default values
$accentColor = #3eaf7c
$textColor = #2c3e50
$borderColor = #eaecef
$codeBgColor = #282c34
```
so I thought only those four variables need to be there in the override file and the rest can be in the other file


[29-Mar-19 10:37 AM] gcharang#6833
This change is there in my PR, let me revert it to your version


[29-Mar-19 10:41 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
okay. 

If we do something like add 
```
<div class="Komodo-unique">
```

that's when I think we would use the style.styl file. 

There's something I didn't fully understand in the VuePress documentation saying that styles that already exist should be included in the `override.styl` file, because of the way VuePress builds the docs. Something about avoiding confusing or repeat work, seemed to be the idea.

I didn't fully understand it, so if you figure it out, let me know. Otherwise, we can just keep overrides for override, and styles for any custom work.

@Bryan_Beus 
to setup page redirects,
The solution here, doesn't work: https://github.com/vuejs/vuepress/issues/239
(it works in dev mode but after build, it doesn't)

But I have a PR ready that is semi working

-  I have updated the vuepress version to `1.0` i.e., vuepress@next
- used the https://v1.vuepress.vuejs.org/plugin/option-api.html#additionalpages  `additioanl pages` API to point the older url to current file path.
- the way it works is when the old url is queried, the new file is shown. the url in addressbar won't change

to test how it works, go to
https://gcharang.github.io/basic-docs/cryptoconditions/cc-dice.html

but, if you navigate to the page using the sidebar, you will find "customconsensus" in the  url

ps: I haven't added this kind of redirect to all the pages, only to the cc-dice page. If this solution is adequate, I will finish adding all the redirects and submit the PR

pps: This work is currently in the branch `patch-1`

Is this the version after removing the landing page?
The theme looks really good btw

My suggestion is keep the landing page and add various cta to it, like: getstarted as it existed previously, create assetchain, explore cc modules
I remember before we removed the extra text in the previous landing page, there was readymade format for that. 

Now we have just removed need for one click, but still the other starting points are many clicks away, even if they know where to navigate to 

But if all these cta are in the previous landing page, then the user can choose where they want to go

That's a possibility.

We've had complaints that the docs are too hard to find. 

Before we make any front page layout, we can try this format? 

I won't be able to spend any more large amounts of time on the theme for a while. Too many other things that aren't finished yet. AtomicDEX white paper is high priority.

Sure @Bryan_Beus  something to keep in mind, will add an issue to remember.
Please check the PR when you have some time


[04-Apr-19 09:33 AM] gcharang#6833
If the branches diverge too much, merging will be difficult later


[04-Apr-19 09:42 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Great. I will try to resolve it today.


[04-Apr-19 11:13 AM] gcharang#6833
Man the people in the vuepress community/dev team are really great.
I asked for help yesterday: https://github.com/vuejs/vuepress/issues/160
After some discussion and a feature request today: https://github.com/vuepress/vuepress-plugin-redirect/issues/1
the guy already implemented it and asked for feedback! and it works

we can now have proper redirects for our docs, no semi-working solution

@Bryan_Beus please ping me when you think the dev branch ready after the current merge.
I will prepare the next PR: it will be updated to vuepress 1.0 and redirects will be ready


[04-Apr-19 12:21 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Great. I am reviewing recent PR at this moment. 

So far, all is well.


[04-Apr-19 12:21 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Almost finished reviewing CC files.

We won't push to master until we get the redirects settled.

[04-Apr-19 12:50 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@gcharang 

Did you try running the merge before merging it?


[04-Apr-19 12:51 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I perused all updates and I didn't see anything to change.

However, running yarn docs:dev resulted in a long list of errors. Looks to me like the Response component added in the pull request is the source of the issue. Can you take a look?


[04-Apr-19 12:52 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Huh. Weird. It's working now.

I tried running yarn install and then ran yarn docs:dev again.


[04-Apr-19 12:53 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Yarn didn't install anything, but it works now. 

¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯


[04-Apr-19 12:54 PM] gcharang#6833
haha, so the PR was fine?


[04-Apr-19 12:56 PM] gcharang#6833
@Bryan_Beus also should I rename the module files from 
`cc-tokens.md` to `tokens-md` ? It will go along with the redirects if not, I will ahve to generate the redirects again


[04-Apr-19 12:56 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
yes, change them


[04-Apr-19 12:56 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
good job


[04-Apr-19 12:56 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I like the Show Response buttons


[04-Apr-19 12:57 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
One note, I see that you have the undesired `:` semi-colon after `Hide Response:`. Might want to change that in next PR.


[04-Apr-19 12:57 PM] gcharang#6833
I have it there on purpose.
It is to signify that there is content after it.
I can remove that if needed


[04-Apr-19 12:58 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
It stands out, since Show Response doesn't have it. 

I'd say remove it. 

For anything that has no response and could be confuses, we should have this in code block:

```
(none)
```


[04-Apr-19 12:59 PM] gcharang#6833
> I'd say remove it. 
Will do

> (none)
noted


[04-Apr-19 01:18 PM] gcharang#6833
@Bryan_Beus can you confirm that redirects are needed only in the cc directory?


[04-Apr-19 01:33 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Oh, we need them in many places, I'm sure.


[04-Apr-19 01:33 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I don't know how your solution is working.


[04-Apr-19 01:35 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I would recommend cloning a fresh repo and going back in the git log history about two weeks. 

Then use something from python or javascript to scan for all links in the document. 

then go back forward to the present and scan again.

Run a script to compare which ones have changed. 

Then enter those into the redirect feature.


[04-Apr-19 01:35 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Is that doable?


[04-Apr-19 01:35 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
So, to scan, you would want to run `yarn docs:build`, and then scan the directory for all html `<a...` links.


[04-Apr-19 01:36 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
You'll get far more than you want to filter.


[04-Apr-19 01:36 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
But, by repeating the script on recent data, you can use present links as the filter.


[04-Apr-19 01:36 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Once filtered, I would imagine the total number of links to redirect will be very manageable.


[04-Apr-19 01:37 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Don't need to overengineer. 

Alternatively, you could look for all links that have `customconsensus` in them, and `cc` in them, and manually manage those.


[04-Apr-19 01:41 PM] gcharang#6833
got it


[04-Apr-19 01:53 PM] gcharang#6833
used this command: `git whatchanged -M5 --summary | grep rename | grep '=>'` 
it shows all the renames that happened in the whole git history.
only renames cause url changes that need redirection, so I am using the result to setup the redirects

[07-Apr-19 11:17 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
For team members who have access to the organization, that's the way it should be? 

But... we don't want people making changes directly to master. I've noticed a few small meaningless typos get pushed straight to master, and it's not a big deal, but we need a process wherein we make sure someone verifies.

I'm going to be making my own `sidd` branch this week, just as gcharang has `gcharang` and alright has `alright`. 

Then, `dev`, is supposed to be the staging ground, wherein we can all see only what's about to get pushed.

If a person without edit access clicks  "suggest an improvement for this page", they are prompted to fork the repo and edit it there.

First accept this PR to dev: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/developer-docs/pull/75
it corrects the vuepress version and locations of the style files
then merge dev to dev-theme, copy styles from override.styl and styl.styl to palette and index then delete them
delete node_modules and yarn.lock
yarn install
yarn docs:dev
you should have the new theme working

developers looks great with the new theme, v.good work @Bryan_Beus 

what is the workflow for redundant pages in docs?   will they there be a courtesy note and redirect saying "This page has been moved to {{ newurl }}"?  This can be made into a vue component.


[13-Apr-19 12:31 AM] Mylo#8306

@Mylo 

Thanks! Gcharang and 808 were both very involved and put a lot of time into it as well.


[13-Apr-19 09:29 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Is there a page that we cut that has been moved?

I think the Introduction.md page, which was moved to the `/` root directory, is the only page I can think of off the top of my head that was moved in that manner.


[13-Apr-19 09:45 PM] Mylo#8306
No just relaying a question from one of the other channels and if docs will eventually be superceded etc.


[13-Apr-19 09:45 PM] Mylo#8306
"no" = not that i'm aware of

gotcha.


[14-Apr-19 12:20 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm not involved with docs.kp website at all. You can ask gcharang about whether it will be superceded


[15-Apr-19 12:14 AM] gcharang#6833
@Mylo
I don't know if docs.kp.com will ever be  replaced, it will always contain the docs that are not suitable for developers.kp.com

Re: redirects, we have a handy plugin from vuepress community that does the job for us: 
https://github.com/vuepress/vuepress-plugin-redirect/tree/next#alias
https://github.com/vuepress/vuepress-plugin-redirect/issues/1

the way it is done is here: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/Documentation/blob/master/docs/.vuepress/public/_redirects.js

I have already added lots of redirects as you can see from the file, I might have missed some

If someone finds a broken link, easiest thing to do is to just ping me in the discord so that I can setup a proper redirect

@Mylo @gcharang just realized something I told you about payments CC is not correct. Total allocations is the number of allocations used when you create the template via paymentstxidopret command.


[22-Apr-19 02:08 PM] Alright#0419
for example 
```
komodo-cli -ac_name=PAY paymentstxidopret \"[1,%2276a914f7e35fb76643f055c0d4cbcc769bb88a83d1cc9f88ac%22]\"

komodo-cli -ac_name=PAY paymentstxidopret \"[2,%222ea22c802065686d47a4049c2c845a71895a915eb84c04445896eec5dc0be40df0b31372da8103120c008203000401cc%22,%226a2ae541414c0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000%22]\"

@SHossain or @gcharang 

I just added the docs for building from source to the upcoming version of developers.kp

Can you please take a look through them and provide feedback?

In particular, the sections that explain how to backup your wallet.dat file as a MacOS or Windows user are lacking in information.

MacOS

It wouldn't need to be a full tutorial. We could include the `curl` aspect in some other tutorial, still.

I've noticed that in Chrome and Chromium, the scrollbar is extremely ugly.

I use Firefox most of the time, so the scrollbar isn't so bad.

If you are interested, you could take a look and see if there are any Vuepress modules available on the net that can allow for simple customization.

@808 would need to approve anything, so you could coordinate with him, if you are interested.


[17-May-19 06:03 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
But otherwise, the docs seem to be coming together well. I do like having the extra collapsible sections.

rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
git clone https://github.com/jl777/komodo --branch master --single-branch
cd komodo
./zcutil/fetch-params.sh
# -j8 = using 8 threads for the compilation - replace 8 with number of threads you want to use

#This can take some time.

I'm sorry, I don't understand. Does the Windows user need to install some kind of Unix shell? I think they call it Putty or something?

I'm lost with the Windows stuff, sorry.


[18-May-19 02:22 PM] SHossain#0007
if any dev wants to build `komodod.exe` & `komodo-cli.exe` locally, they need to use either Debian OS or Ubuntu OS to cross-compile


[18-May-19 02:23 PM] SHossain#0007
there is no known way to build windows bins from Windows (at least i'm not aware of it)


[18-May-19 02:23 PM] SHossain#0007
Putty is just to connect to server via ssh or telnet

In the section that we have right now here:

what is the advantage to following those instructions, as opposed to following these instructions here (which I have listed in the introductory "Simple Installations" section, for pre-built binaries)?

Could we delete everything here:

and in its place, put instructions for the commands you listed above?

for Windows, cross-compilation needed using Debian/Ubuntu OS
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config libc6-dev m4 g++-multilib autoconf libtool ncurses-dev unzip git python python-zmq zlib1g-dev wget libcurl4-gnutls-dev bsdmainutils automake curl cmake mingw-w64
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
git clone https://github.com/jl777/komodo --branch master --single-branch
cd komodo
./zcutil/fetch-params.sh
# -j8 = using 8 threads for the compilation - replace 8 with number of threads you want to use

#This can take some time.

@gcharang 

I'm working through the Fluidity section at the moment.

Previously, I have avoided the term RPC, because it adds complexity to the documents and I am not sure how familiar a simple JavaScript or Python developer would be with this term. I had never heard of it outside of Komodo.

However, the docs are getting so complicated, it's making it more complicated to maintain "API command" than to just explain "RPC" each time. 

So, what I'd like to change our habit to is this, let me know what you think.

For each separate document, and/or for each separate section where we expect a developer to skip to and we assume they will not have read everything that comes before it, the first time we mention "RPC", we do it this way.

"...Remote Procedure Call (RPC)", much like we did with "Custom Consensus (CC)".

Then, we can skip to using only "RPC" thereafter.

Think that works?

We would need to find all instances of "API command" and "command," and check to see if they need to be switched. I can do this, as I'm rewriting so much already anyway.


[18-May-19 10:31 PM] gcharang#6833
that works @Bryan_Beus 
I remember we used `method` in a lot of instances too


[19-May-19 04:13 AM] Mylo#8306
RPC was before REST was cool.  RPC is understood by devs as "remote procedure call".

I was going to suggest it for "using curl".

BC and BC apps are network apps and network programming.  Even the CLI commands are just a command line version of RPC calls for convenience.

In the intro this may been to be a highlight point, eg "welcome to distributed state network applications"

i've got a map of "project lifecycle" maybe i need to get it back into marketing graphics to see if usable.  then we can have a map of smart chain creation, block explorer install, CC discovery & testing, which links to all relevant bits....  the map is on an external hard drive so i'll have to retrieve it later.


[28-May-19 12:46 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Mylo 

It is a good post to have, and I can include it. 

It probably isn't top priority. 

The biggest priority is the rest of the tutorials we need for a Type B developer. 

Once we get those done, we could also focus on this. 

What do you think?

@Alright or @gcharang 

In the developers.kp website, are there general instructions we can give about how to build the komodod software so that it launches all CC modules?

Right now, all our install instructions are contained in separate tutorials in the modules.

I'm working on dimxy's Heir module tutorial, and I need install instructions, but the Heir module currently does not have any instructions.

really not sure what it is you need tbh


[29-May-19 05:30 PM] Alright#0419
"install instructions", instructions to start a new chain with it or...?


[29-May-19 05:33 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Let's look at the Rick asset chain for an example.


[29-May-19 05:33 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Here's the launch command.


[29-May-19 05:33 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
```
./komodod -pubkey=$pubkey -ac_name=RICK -ac_supply=90000000000 -ac_reward=100000000 -ac_cc=3 -addnode=138.201.136.145 &
```


[29-May-19 05:33 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
That has `ac_cc=3` on it, which means ac_cc is active, although RICK is not fungible with anything else.


[29-May-19 05:34 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
But does it also mean that the Heir module would be active on it?

(P.S. I tried to test this myself, in case you are wondering. Crashed my VPS at AWS due to size constraints and I haven't had time to get it running again.)


[29-May-19 05:35 PM] Alright#0419
ac_cc=<anything> without ac_ccenable will activate all CCs other than cclib CCs


[29-May-19 05:35 PM] Alright#0419
so yes, heir validation is active on RICK


[29-May-19 05:35 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ahh, Okay. So it's cclib CC's that are different...


[29-May-19 05:35 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm trying to remember how cclib CC's are different...


[29-May-19 05:36 PM] Alright#0419
non-cclib CCs are built into the daemon, cclib CCs can be thought of as an add-on


[29-May-19 05:37 PM] Alright#0419
cclib CCs, you must build the daemon specifically for that cclib
non-cclib CCs, they are built into the daemon no matter what


[29-May-19 05:38 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ahh, okay. Thanks. I hadn't fully separated that out in my mind. Got it.


[29-May-19 06:22 PM] gcharang#6833
To add to alright's points, even though non cclib ccs are definitely built into the daemon, you can select which among them will be active on a specific chain using the -ac_ccenable param @Bryan_Beus


[29-May-19 06:22 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok, thanks


[29-May-19 07:53 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@gcharang 

Can you please do me a favor?

komodod crashed on me due to issues with my VPS (not related to Komodo) and I don't have time to troubleshoot. 

Could you create a Smart Chain, activate the Heir module, and send me an example of a transaction that has OP_RETURN values in it?


[29-May-19 07:53 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
No worries if you are too busy. I can come back to this later.


[29-May-19 07:55 PM] gcharang#6833
@Bryan_Beus I can do that easily, but what do you mean by txn having op_return?


[29-May-19 07:56 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Take a look at the tutorial I'm working on. Link coming.

Do a search for "Transaction Data Structure"


[29-May-19 07:57 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
It's the heading


[29-May-19 07:57 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Read the content a little before, and then read a few paragraphs after.


[29-May-19 07:57 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
You'll see that I need example code in there.


[29-May-19 07:57 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
We also need an example of an initial transaction that has op return data.


[29-May-19 07:58 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I was thinking it would be good to have a faucet initial transaction, due to the context in the tutorial.


[29-May-19 07:58 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
So, you'd have to make a new smart chain, and then create a faucet instance on the chain. (Can only be one faucet, so no existing chains would work.)


[29-May-19 07:58 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Or, we could do an initial transaction of an Heir module instance.


[29-May-19 08:00 PM] gcharang#6833
Starting a chain, let me read the doc and send you the details

@Bryan_Beus faucet is a bad example of a CC IMO

should not be using it as an example, it's unlike the rest of them


[29-May-19 08:15 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Okay, good to know, @Alright>

I'm only editing content from @dimxy. Didn't choose the example.

The tutorial is mostly focused around Heir. 

But we can avoid Faucet for the initial transaction?


[29-May-19 08:16 PM] Alright#0419
faucet doesn't follow many of the same conventions that the other CCs follow. Nothing wrong with it, just structured a bit differently than everything else


[29-May-19 08:16 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
For the purposes of the tutorial, I think it should be okay? It's only in there momentarily as an aside.


[29-May-19 08:17 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@gcharang 

That's great. I found the OP_R in it and will see if I can edit it in now...


[29-May-19 08:17 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442

I don't think it is necessary that all initial txns of  a module have op_return, for example faucetfund doesn't have it, thats because there can only be 1 on chain faucet per chain as of current design

Does selfimport mean that one doesn’t need NN services for xchain?


[17-Jun-19 11:46 PM] gcharang#6833
@Mylo it must have `-ac_import=PUBKEY`(literally) and `-ac_pubkey`  in launch parameters
yes, it doesn't need NN's involvement

but we could say it is centralised around the owner of the Pubkey. The newly created coins can be kept track because it is a blockchain, otherwise it is exactly like a central bank printing money

If you have time, it would be good if you could review these updates quickly. (No worries if you have other tasks.)

If you can, though, then I will take your final edits and merge everything into sidd branch.

Then, you can merge sidd branch into gcharang.

We only want to use dev branch one more time (after you do the current review). The time I'm speaking about is when we take the AtomicDEX docs and push them live, just before July 4th for the beta launch.

After that, we need to get all the sidd branch content ready to go. 

We're going to have a busy few weeks. There's a lot of docs coming in at the last minute.

I'll probably have artem cross out anything that is no longer applicable.


[02-Jul-19 12:16 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@artem.pikulin @artemciy_dice 

I hate to disturb you both, and if you are too busy, let me know and I'll see what I can work out.

Here's what's needed, once we have time.

I need you two to work together to read through this discussion on AtomicDEX and cross out anything that is no longer applicable.

To cross out text in markdown, you use double tildes. `~~content~~`

You don't need to worry about adding anything in, only worry about cutting stuff out. 

If there's something that truly needs to be added for the conversation to make sense, go ahead and describe it, but you can keep your descriptions short and I will ask for more information, if needed.

We are running low on time, and rewriting this content from the beginning is not feasible. But we do need to bring it up a reasonable level.

If you don't have time right now to work on this at all, and won't before the rebrand, let me know please and I'll figure out something else. Thank you.

"Additionally, AtomicDEX provides a layer of privacy during the order-matching process, enabling two nodes to perform a peer-to-peer atomic swap without any direct IP contact."
@Bryan_Beus , @artem.pikulin , correct me if I'm wrong, but AFAIK we didn't have any such privacy layers in MarketMaker.
(In today's MM2 the DHT communication during the swap is anonymous and not IP based, but order matching is still IP based, plus we have plans of endpoint discovery through order matching for direct UDP communication).

[03-Jul-19 06:09 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
@artem.pikulin , not sure if the "Order Matching with Full-Relay and Non-Relay Nodes" section still applies. Ditto on "Zero-Knowledge Technology Adds Privacy".


[03-Jul-19 06:20 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
The "The Utxo: an Elusive, Yet Fundamental Concept" section might be of less importance now.
I tried to highlight things for @artem.pikulin  to review and I've stopped on the "The Utxo: an Elusive, Yet Fundamental Concept" for now (switching to other tasks).


[03-Jul-19 06:43 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
Yes, AtomicDEX doesn't provide any privacy layers, z-addr support is planned, but not implemented yet and all info will be public anyway, the swap transactions will be done using public addresses so it's possible to estimate the available amount even on private address.


[03-Jul-19 06:44 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
`Liquidity Multiplication` is still there, we might have some issues in edge cases but it works. The issue #432 is one of these edge cases, using entire balance for trade is a bit tricky due to necessity of paying miner fees etc.


[03-Jul-19 06:46 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
`not sure if the "Order Matching with Full-Relay and Non-Relay Nodes" section still applies. Ditto on "Zero-Knowledge Technology Adds Privacy".` - we're still using relay nodes concept for P2P messages exchange, but it's not required to be a full-relay node to be maker, so this can be rewritten.


[03-Jul-19 06:48 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
`"The Utxo: an Elusive, Yet Fundamental Concept"` - yes, it's not applicable anymore, MM2 users might not care about UTXOs at all. Even developers relying on MM2 might be not aware about specific coin implementation as MM2 hides this behind universal APIs for all coins.

Okay, I'll see if I can fix all of that.

I think we'll decouple the utxo conversation from AtomicDEX, therefore, but keep it around, as they frequently intrude in educational conversation and its best to make sure developers at least understand what utxos are.


[03-Jul-19 12:39 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442

I don't remember seeing any instructions in the new docs about how to become a full relay node?

[03-Jul-19 06:20 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@artem.pikulin @artemciy_dice 

I just updated the atomicdex doc.

Based on your feedback, I was able to reduce it by probably 50% or so, and I think we still have more content to cut out. (This is great! Simpler is better.)

Please do a general review when you have time.

also, take a look specifically at the sections regarding the Trust API and the <setconfirmation> RPC call that was part of MM1.


[03-Jul-19 06:35 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442

@artem.pikulin , I'd like to highlight "Trust API" and "Zero Confirmations" for your review. We might also suggest updating terms Alice and Bob, though I don't know how long will it take and whether https://github.com/artemii235/SuperNET/issues/403 would factor in.

Also, @artem.pikulin, in the documentation we have some leftover commentary from 2017 that states that there are RPCs available for setting the number of confirmations required for each step of the swap process.

However, I don't see any such RPCs in the current docs.

Should I delete that documentation?

Good work, thank you.

We also need to go through each individual file and look for links.

If anyone is familiar with the Payments Module and can help fill in the blanks on what's missing, this would help a lot. We could include Payments Module in the rebrand, if we receive feedback quickly.

@Bryan_Beus I can try to get to it sometime this week, this has some stuff I wasn't aware of


[14-Jul-19 07:58 AM] Alright#0419
have you tested that substituting an address for script works for paymentstxidopret? didn't know that was possible


[14-Jul-19 10:46 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Alright 

I have not done any testing.

I took the language that was there previously. If the meaning was unclear, I did my best to try to write out what I think the original author intended, with more specific information. Then I send it back for someone who actually knows to review and correct. 

When the information given to me is written ambiguously, this can lead to confusion when I attempt to re-write the content. Hopefully, the lack of clarity becomes more visible to the original author after my attempted rewrite, or at least to someone who is fully up to speed with the technical topic, and from there we can correct to full accuracy.


[14-Jul-19 10:46 AM] Alright#0419

@Alright
I added all the currently available explanations after testing and consulting with joker

 if you are already familiar with the Payments cc, you will have a better time than me documenting the rest of the features
I got stuck at `useopret` and wasn't able to understand

```
There are 2 possible places the funds for this createtxid can be, the first is the special address that is derived from combining the globalCC address with the txidaddr. txidaddr is a non-spendable markeraddress created by converting the txid into a 33 byte pubkey by prefixing 0x02 to the txid. It is a 1of2 address, so it doesnt matter that nobody knows the privkey for this txidaddr. the second address is the global CC address and only utxo to that address with an opreturn containing the createtxid are funds valid for this payments CC createtxid
 
 next let us add some funds to it. the funds can be to either of the two addresses, controlled by useopret (defaults to 0)
 
 ./c paymentsfund \"[%22318d827cc6d8f25f40517e7fb0982e3f707b4aa749d322483fc336686a87b28a%22,1,0]\" -> txid 28f69b925bb7a21d2a3ba2327e85eb2031b014e976e43f5c2c6fb8a76767b221, which indeed sent funds to RWRM36sC8jSctyFZtsu7CyDcHYPdZX7nPZ without an opreturn and it appears on the payments info.
 
 ./c paymentsfund \"[%22318d827cc6d8f25f40517e7fb0982e3f707b4aa749d322483fc336686a87b28a%22,1,1]\" -> txid cc93330b5c951b724b246b3b138d00519c33f2a600a7c938bc9e51aff6e20e32, which indeed sent funds to REpyKi7avsVduqZ3eimncK4uKqSArLTGGK with an opreturn and it appears on the payments info.
```

[14-Jul-19 11:59 AM] Alright#0419
not 100% sure about it myself, I just know if the paymentsrelease tx requires an opreturn, payments fund must use 1 for that param


[14-Jul-19 12:00 PM] Alright#0419
I think it's just the difference between whether the allocations include an opreturn or not


[14-Jul-19 12:00 PM] Alright#0419

payments uses it on THC chain, and prices uses it to pay the fees to the payments airdrop CC

## paymentsrelease

**paymentsrelease '[“createtxid",amount,(skipminimum)]'**

Amount is amount to release, it must be above the minimum.
Skipminimum is a flag, if there are address with such low balance minimumtoaddress cannot be paid, this will truncate the rich list off at the first address that is being paid the wrong amount.
```
can you explain `skipminimum`?


[14-Jul-19 06:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
the dust threshold is 10,000 sats. Any payout under this will be skipped.


[14-Jul-19 06:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think you can set it to something else on paymentscreate


[14-Jul-19 06:57 PM] gcharang#6833
it will skip payments to scriptPubkeys below 10,000 sats when `skipminimum == 1`? @Deleted User


[14-Jul-19 06:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
yes. James requested this to be added, because otehrwise someone can send a lot of dust to some address and the paymentsrelease would not be able to be sent.

@gcharang @Bryan_Beus 
to what extent have you looked at components in vuepress?

i'm writing a doc atm, and it's the first in a series of docs during the antara/atomicdex/komodo era (aakmd) 

example:
i'm making a marketmaker howto and in it, there will be a section for "installing kmd daemon" at some stage.  these instructions already exist, in both long & short form.   it will be a set of instructions that will be repeated in umpteen docs.

what would be cool is this as a scenario for a doc writer with a template
:
create a new page.
header -> component with some branding/logo/header etc.
intro -> normal content that we currently write
install_kmd -> component re-used
start kmd with pubkey -> component re-used
do some new custom oracles stuff -> normal new content how we currently write
exporting oracles data -> component re-used
conclusion/next-steps -> custom stuff

also, export to PDF and other formats.    this would make document versioning freaking fantastic.


[19-Jul-19 01:13 AM] Mylo#8306
any experience /feedback on that kind of workflow would be grande 😃

@Mylo 

I worked through that textbook a few months ago on Vue, but I never had time to put any of this into practice.

The primary component on VuePress developers.kp was built by gcharang, so he might be able to provide an answer.


[19-Jul-19 09:32 AM] Mylo#8306
ok thanks mate 😃


[19-Jul-19 08:24 PM] gcharang#6833
https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/developer-docs/blob/master/docs/.vuepress/components/collapse-text.vue -- this is the only component we are using right now

export pdf: https://github.com/ulivz/vuepress-plugin-export

I didn't understand why we would want this as those are all present in the navbar
```
header -> component with some branding/logo/header etc.
```

the rest of the components are doable v.easily

is it alright to use THC as an example in docs like this?


[21-Jul-19 03:52 PM] Alright#0419
Would like to do something similar with ac_notarypay and LABS as well


[21-Jul-19 03:53 PM] Alright#0419
figured it's much easier to explain if user can see real world example, but not sure we want to be mentioning other coins in our docs directly


[22-Jul-19 12:00 AM] gcharang#6833
@Bryan_Beus it is sidd's call


[22-Jul-19 10:53 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@Alright 

To answer this question, we should look at a previous case.

We use Verus sometimes as an example in the docs, because they have proven tech that is contributing to the ecosystem. They wrote some of the code that we use now in komodod.

Did THC provide the code that we are using, and has this code been viewed and approved by one of our lead developers? 

If so, then fine. If not, then no.


[22-Jul-19 11:41 AM] Alright#0419
all of the code is our's joker's and jl's code


[22-Jul-19 11:41 AM] Alright#0419
@Bryan_Beus


[22-Jul-19 11:41 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Okay, so then no mention of THC, please.


[22-Jul-19 11:41 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Can you make an example chain with this param?


[22-Jul-19 11:41 AM] Alright#0419
so LABS example for ac_notarypay is fine?


[22-Jul-19 11:42 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
yep


[22-Jul-19 11:42 AM] Alright#0419
well it's simple for them to look at an explorer and see how it works


[22-Jul-19 11:42 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
isn't LABS a Komodo project?


[22-Jul-19 11:42 AM] Alright#0419
not going to keep a chain running(and explorer) just to show an example


[22-Jul-19 11:42 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Oh, I see, you want people to see the explorer


[22-Jul-19 11:42 AM] Alright#0419
yep


[22-Jul-19 11:42 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Hmm, and no existing Komodo-based chain with an explorer can provide this example?


[22-Jul-19 11:43 AM] Alright#0419
no worries, I'll leave out THC and just use an example chain


[22-Jul-19 11:43 AM] Alright#0419
don't think it's going to come across as well though tbh


[22-Jul-19 11:43 AM] Alright#0419
no other chains using earlytxid yet


[22-Jul-19 11:43 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Okay. 

Putting THC in our docs associates us with them, and I don't know them very well. 

We also become more beholden to other chains feeling an expectation of representation in the docs


[22-Jul-19 11:44 AM] Alright#0419

[22-Jul-19 12:24 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Do you feel that having THC there is best for Komodo? If so, then go ahead and use it as an example.


[22-Jul-19 12:35 PM] Alright#0419
ehhhh they don't have a great dev team, but their chain is bleeding edge of Antara stuff basically(because we designed it 😂 ). Leaving it out or maybe just a single line "HempCoin uses this functionality, you can see it on the explorer here", something like this possibly


[22-Jul-19 12:38 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Okay, you choose. I'll edit whatever you put in there.

Try to keep it brief. If THC goes belly up, or does something shady, we want as little relationship as possible -- and we likely won't remember that this reference is present in the docs.

An interesting concept that might be of interest to stick on a list of potential Antara Modules.

Lease Proof of Stake. You can lend out your coins for other users on the network to stake.

I like that concept quite a bit for being able to store large amounts of coins on an offline wallet and yet still being able to stake them

Also at the top of the page for the workflow, there is no mention of the funding of the oracle.
The docs for RPC method `oraclesfund` says to fund before registering as a publisher, @smkhound  blog post http://rant.cryptocartography.io/anatomy-of-an-oracle/ says to fund after registering.

I cannot register or fund an oracle atm.

@jl777c or @Alright 

I'm currently working on the advanced developer tutorial for the Komodo Academy. I rewrote this section here. Can you please verify that this is accurate? (What was there before apparently wasn't accurate.)

```
Utxo-based modules are harder to create than balance-based smart contracts. However, utxo-based modules result in dramatically more powerful and secure functionality, as they leverage the existing Bitcoin-utxo system.

For example, within balance-based smart contracts transactions do not have to pass a full review by the consensus mechanism of the underlying blockchain. Instead, most of the transaction verification happens within a decentralized virtual machine that executes code written by the developer. In this situation, all developers involved in a smart contract must maintain a high level of programming awareness to avoid disasters, such as those seen in the Parity Attack.
```


[03-Dec-19 10:02 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
```
In a utxo-based module, the risk of such events is exponentially reduced. One reason utxo-based modules are more secure is that every update of the blockchain's state must be executed as a Bitcoin-protocol based transaction, as opposed to a virtual-machine and developer-created transaction. Therefore, the updating data on a Komodo Smart Chain requires that the method of adding the data pass the Bitcoin protocol's normal rules of consensus.

As Komodo is based on the Bitcoin protocol, Komodo's Smart Chain consensus mechanism is built on the most rigorously tested and heavily supported software in the industry. Balance-based smart contracts that use the popular virtual-machine model cannot compare to this level of security.

(Note, however, that one cannot create a 100% secure, blockchain-based, arbitrary code executor. A faulty Antara Module can still allow for disastrous results. Having the Bitcoin-protocol's consensus mechanism available for each transaction reduces the responsibility on a developer, but cannot eliminate the responsibility entirely.)
```


[03-Dec-19 10:35 PM] jl777c#5810
there is still risk of bugs with CC to have undesired effects, but it would only be for the specific utxo that are locked in a CC

since it's written 1, it could be vice versa


[04-Dec-19 06:42 AM] naezith#9757
so I have to assume

got it, the example could have made a better point


[04-Dec-19 06:43 AM] naezith#9757

[04-Dec-19 06:44 AM] naezith#9757
so at the buy order, let's say I have MORTY and I want to buy KMD


[04-Dec-19 06:45 AM] naezith#9757
I wrote `base` MORTY, `rel` KMD because I am giving up MORTY for KMD


[04-Dec-19 06:45 AM] naezith#9757
but that's wrong because it results in an error since I have no KMD `The KMD amount 777/10000 is larger than available 0.00000000, balance: 0`


[04-Dec-19 06:46 AM] naezith#9757
so now I know I need to swap them


[04-Dec-19 06:46 AM] naezith#9757
`base` KMD, `rel` MORTY


[04-Dec-19 06:46 AM] naezith#9757
okay, but now what will be the price


[04-Dec-19 06:47 AM] naezith#9757
buying KMD at x MORTY each I assume, x being the price


[04-Dec-19 06:50 AM] naezith#9757
I want to trade my 7.77 MORTY with 0.0777 KMD


[04-Dec-19 06:50 AM] naezith#9757
that's 100 MORTY for 1 KMD


[04-Dec-19 06:51 AM] naezith#9757
so going with docs, I am entering `base` KMD, `rel` MORTY, price `100`


[04-Dec-19 06:52 AM] naezith#9757
error `The MORTY amount 777 is larger than available 77.70000000, balance: 77.7`


[04-Dec-19 06:53 AM] naezith#9757
volume needs to be `0.0777` that's what I did wrong


[04-Dec-19 06:54 AM] naezith#9757
okay got it


[04-Dec-19 06:56 AM] naezith#9757
I think you can simply add 

Example:
To buy 0.0777 KMD with your 7.77 MORTY, parameters need to be: `base` KMD, `rel` MORTY, `volume` 0.0777, `price` 100

I will update the doc you are going through
for now, this example <https://developers.atomicdex.io/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-tutorials/how-to-become-a-liquidity-provider.html#trading>
should clear some confusion

another clear description for `base` and `rel` can be


[04-Dec-19 07:09 AM] gcharang#6833
@naezith did you have to use
```
LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib cargo build
```

or

```
LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib cargo build --features native -vv
```


[04-Dec-19 07:09 AM] naezith#9757
native


[04-Dec-19 07:10 AM] naezith#9757
`base` is what will be what seller will send and `rel` is what seller will receive


[04-Dec-19 07:11 AM] naezith#9757
this is correct for all calls right? including buy


[04-Dec-19 07:11 AM] naezith#9757
if so you can type that, very clear


[04-Dec-19 07:13 AM] gcharang#6833
base is the coin the user desires to receive for `buy`
base is the name of the coin the user desires to `sell`

the api doc page is better for checking these things
<https://developers.atomicdex.io/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.html>


[04-Dec-19 10:27 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Can you please help me gain a better understanding? I am still not able to clearly articulate how Antara is more secure than the smart-contract models popular on other platforms. 

How does the Antara solution differ specifically from the virtual-machine/smart-contract model in regards to this statement?

> there is still risk of bugs with CC to have undesired effects, but it would only be for the specific utxo that are locked in a CC


[04-Dec-19 10:30 AM] gcharang#6833
in ETH model, as they have accounts, a bug in a Smart Contract or the ETH-VM implementation can affect all the coins/tokens in that account

in cc, if there is a bug in a particular Antara module, only coins that are attached to that module are affected
rest of the coins that belong to the same privkey/pubkey pair are safe


[04-Dec-19 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure if a smartcontract is allowed to spend a specified ETH address


[04-Dec-19 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
if that is the case, it is easy to demonstrate the problem


[04-Dec-19 10:46 AM] jl777c#5810
make 2 different contracts that can spend the same ETH address


[04-Dec-19 10:46 AM] jl777c#5810
now make 100


[04-Dec-19 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
you have what should be independent contracts all depending on a single addresses balance, but we need to check to see if contracts are actually written this way or if each contract needs to be funded specifically.


[04-Dec-19 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
in that case the difference is that with CC, only professionals are writing the code, while with ERC20 anybody, even those not so experienced are writing them, in fact they seem to encourage weekend coders to be making financial smart contracts


[04-Dec-19 11:06 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
okay, I'll see if I can rewrite to take those things into account.


[04-Dec-19 11:06 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
thank you both


[04-Dec-19 11:07 AM] gcharang#6833
> in ETH model, as they have accounts, a bug in a Smart Contract or the ETH-VM implementation can affect all the coins/tokens in that account

it seems I have taken it too far. contract accounts are different from user accounts


[04-Dec-19 11:08 AM] gcharang#6833
and contract accounts are triggered when they receive transactions(value) from other accounts
they are funded seperately


[04-Dec-19 11:12 AM] gcharang#6833
the main issue I see is this  
> in that case the difference is that with CC, only professionals are writing the code, while with ERC20 anybody, even those not so experienced are writing them, in fact they seem to encourage weekend coders to be making financial smart contracts

and where as we use tried and tested c/c++ and other general languages to program the modules, the EVM is coded from scratch and has a high chance of implementation bugs (like the split function in DAO hack) and  high chance of developer mistakes due to ignorance of best practices (because solidity is so new)

 <https://hackernoon.com/the-evm-is-fundamentally-unsafe-d69f2e3b908b>


[04-Dec-19 11:18 AM] gcharang#6833
```
A well-constructed Virtual Machine (VM) seeks to protect language designers from dangerous mistakes and support efficient construction with central features like dispatch support, name resolution and so forth. The EVM, however, fails to provide similar guarantees, often with the vague justification of embodying a core ethos of Ethereum, to present “a global computation machine.” It is possible to have a Turing-complete machine without subjecting developers to risks that modern VMs have eliminated for decades. Instead, the EVM disregards this wisdom and expects the surface languages that compile to it to address them.
```

in contrast, Antara modules are written in tried and tested languages; and developers are given only the API necessary to use the module; this API too can be accessed using any standard language
there is less chance to make mistakes as there is a smaller interface to access it (sth like can't hang oneself if the rope is too small lol)

swaps fail with the `coins` file docs tell me to create (<https://developers.atomicdex.io/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-tutorials/atomicdex-walkthrough.html#setting-up-the-coin-list>) 

solution is to add two more lines to both coins

The field my_balance_change


[08-Dec-19 02:45 AM] Slyris#2880
seem's to contains a typo


[08-Dec-19 02:45 AM] Slyris#2880
starting by a coma


[08-Dec-19 02:45 AM] Slyris#2880

`  "my_balance_change": ",-10.000021"`

Hey @gcharang Is it possible to have an example answer for tx_history success on an ETH/ERC20 coin ? 

I have no idea if the format is different


[08-Dec-19 03:05 AM] Slyris#2880
(I'm sure that in case of success, there is some difference with kmd/btc/utxo coins but i have no idea which kind of difference, it's not specified in the doc


[08-Dec-19 03:07 AM] gcharang#6833
tbh, I haven't documented AtomicDEX rpc at all
the specifics are unknown to me as well

for clarification in issues such as
> (I'm sure that in case of success, there is some difference with kmd/btc/utxo coins but i have no idea which kind of difference, it's not specified in the doc

I think it is easier for @smkhound or @TonyL to answer, as they have mm2 nodes up and testing it continously


[08-Dec-19 03:08 AM] Slyris#2880
Ok so if it's possible to send me for erc 20 / eth answer because i don't have those coins ! 

Thank's a lot


[08-Dec-19 03:09 AM] Slyris#2880
@gcharang As i'm doing the desktop wallet for atomic dex i would need those informations, that's why !

got it, lets wait for tony or smk to come online

atomicDEX desktop in qt will be a great addition btw
I am looking forward to its release

i was right

note you need to prepend `0x`


[08-Dec-19 03:42 AM] Slyris#2880
fees is different :p


[08-Dec-19 03:42 AM] smkhound#7640
if you check in explorer


[08-Dec-19 03:44 AM] Slyris#2880
That's funny because here: https://etherscan.io


[08-Dec-19 03:44 AM] smkhound#7640
I think fees have changed in different versions. Those transactions were around a month ago


[08-Dec-19 03:44 AM] Slyris#2880
If you search without 0x


[08-Dec-19 03:45 AM] Slyris#2880
it's prepend :p


[08-Dec-19 03:45 AM] Slyris#2880
ah ? @smkhound


[08-Dec-19 03:45 AM] Slyris#2880
You think the format is different today ?


[08-Dec-19 03:45 AM] Slyris#2880
I just need to be sure about the format


[08-Dec-19 03:45 AM] smkhound#7640
cool. I just recall having to prepend to build the url for requests.get() in py

still being tested

i'm trying to do smth really solid


[08-Dec-19 03:53 AM] smkhound#7640
tx history on atomicdex addresses are verbose, each trade having multiple tx. I made addresses linkable to block explorer as an option which didnt take up screen space (and coding time :D)


[08-Dec-19 03:53 AM] Slyris#2880
I'm more looking for the wallet transaction send/receive more than trade history

tx history from mm2 cover both @smkhound ?


[08-Dec-19 03:54 AM] Slyris#2880
i guess that for trade history you use: my_orders ?


[08-Dec-19 03:54 AM] Slyris#2880
and for wallet history i should use: my_tx_history


[08-Dec-19 03:55 AM] smkhound#7640
yeah I believe so. for eth you can see things going to/from the contract address

[15-Dec-19 07:23 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
Hi 🙂


[15-Dec-19 07:25 AM] Slyris#2880
Thanks for the clarification @artemciy_dice @artem.pikulin 

I was planning to make a `std::map<std::string, my_order_contents>` I will probably go for a `boost::multi_index` based on this criteria.


[15-Dec-19 07:28 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
So `map<string` would store the orders in the alphanumeric order of `string`, it wouldn't preserve the original order. `multi_index` sounds all right if you're using Boost already.

Yeah i'm using boost already, but i would keep the possibility to retrieve the order based on his id, but keep it sorted on the timestamp.

Hello, i got a question about `mm2` if someone is around @artem.pikulin or @artemciy_dice 

Do our `orders` have a limited lifespan? (Create with the call rpc `buy`)

I ask that because last night I created a very specific `RICK / MORTY order`, `0.01 RICK per MORTY`

The order appeared in the order book, I could see it very well.

This morning when I wake up, I see that the order is no longer present in the order book.

So I thought someone had sold me `RICK` for that price, but no, I checked my transaction history and nothing happened.

I am currently developing the atomicDex desktop application and I do not yet have the `cancel_order` and `cancel_all_order` function in the GUI, so in any case I could not have canceled my order.


[16-Dec-19 01:38 AM] Slyris#2880
This is the answer of `my_orders` now: `{"result":{"maker_orders":{},"taker_orders":{}}}`

@Slyris the order should persist between restarts until it's matched or explicitly cancelled.
Could you please check the `my_recent_swaps`, maybe it contains failed swap? Also the order won't be displayed if you start MM2 with different passphrase. It uses different DB path per passphrase.
Also the order will be lost if DB dir is deleted or MM2 is started from another directory. DB is typically located in the MM2 working directory.

(same passphrase in my case)


[16-Dec-19 03:31 AM] Slyris#2880
AH


[16-Dec-19 03:32 AM] Slyris#2880
Ok i got it, it's the DB


[16-Dec-19 03:32 AM] Slyris#2880
i deleted the build folder @artem.pikulin


[16-Dec-19 03:32 AM] Slyris#2880
That's why...


[16-Dec-19 03:32 AM] Slyris#2880
So my order still exist somewhere, but not locally ?


[16-Dec-19 03:33 AM] Slyris#2880
Let's say i'm on the computer A i place a buy order.

Now i connect with the same passphrase on my laptop computer B during hollidays, i will not be able to follow my orders ?


[16-Dec-19 03:33 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
No, as of now MM2 rebroadcasts the order to keep it alive. If your node is down or doesn't have the order anymore other nodes will delete it from local orderbook.


[16-Dec-19 03:34 AM] Slyris#2880
😮


[16-Dec-19 03:34 AM] Slyris#2880
I absolutely need something to sync between desktop app with same passphrase


[16-Dec-19 03:34 AM] Slyris#2880
But same problem occured on mobile ? if i have 2 telephone and i restore the same wallet on both, i cannot track order between each other


[16-Dec-19 03:34 AM] Slyris#2880
if i understand


[16-Dec-19 03:35 AM] Slyris#2880
(or yes i can if i never delete the DB/build folder)


[16-Dec-19 03:36 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
`Now i connect with the same passphrase on my laptop computer B during hollidays, i will not be able to follow my orders ?` - your created orders are not synchronized between different devices even if they use same passphrase. Moreover 2 devices with same passphrase should not be running concurrently, it's not strictly prohibited, it's kind of undefined behavior.


[16-Dec-19 03:37 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
For swap history we already have the `import` functionality, possibly we may have same feature for orders. Is this essential and important as of now?


[16-Dec-19 03:38 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
On desktop btw you can just export and import the entire DB dir as zip archive if required.


[16-Dec-19 03:41 AM] Slyris#2880
Ok I understand


[16-Dec-19 03:41 AM] Slyris#2880
It's work with the db


[16-Dec-19 03:41 AM] Slyris#2880
I will provide this functionality


[23-Dec-19 12:35 PM] Slyris#2880
everyone is in holliday ?

Can someone help me with mm2 ?


[23-Dec-19 01:26 PM] Slyris#2880
If some is avaialble ?

On one of my machine i always get:

```json

resp: {"result":{"current_block":5315960,"from_id":null,"limit":50,"skipped":0,"sync_status":{"state":"NotEnabled"},"total":0,"transactions":[]}}
```

Usually it's take 30second for my transaction to appear for the first time in the DB, but here they never appear


[23-Dec-19 01:27 PM] Slyris#2880
Always stuck on "NotEnabled"


[23-Dec-19 01:28 PM] Slyris#2880
If i launch mm2 by hand it's the same, even if i enable with electrum RICK/MORTY transactions never appear :/


[23-Dec-19 01:28 PM] Slyris#2880
Once they appear for the first time i get it from the Database if i remember


[23-Dec-19 01:30 PM] Slyris#2880
If you want a good book for C++ programming let me know @TonyL I have a very good one
