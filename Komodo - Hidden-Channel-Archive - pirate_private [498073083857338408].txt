Sounds good.   I also DM'd you too.   Glad to do the announce and take any flak or questions.  Just redirect to me.   You guys have more important things to do.

Can someone here fill out this webform for me,  someone who knows the code?
https://www.cheddur.com/coin
It's at this site.   You can use this below for the description and change or add to it as you please.  I don't know some of the answers at the bottom of the page.  

I want to know how we can go about getting our Equihash coin added to your calculator.  
Currently, in less than 6 weeks, we are the 3rd highest hash rate of any equihash coin.  
We are also the most secure, we feel, in terms of privacy as well as security with dPoW from Komodo securing our chain to Bitcoins hashrate.
We are not listed on exchanges but we have an API that is updated twice daily on confirmed Minimum market purchase price.
This is what Crypto-Coinz will be using as well as any other integration sites until we get on an exchange.
Here is the API : 
https://dexstats.info/api/pirateprice.php 
Here is the base purchase site being used for onboarding new pirates which is based on the lowest OTC price at the time: 
https://dexstats.info/onboarding.php
Please let me know what you would need to integrate the coin into your calculators. 
Thank you for your time and consideration,

I‚Äôm off for the night.  Be good, pirates.


[07-Oct-18 01:29 AM] jl777c#5810
something I realized most people probably dont know:
maybe many people assume that zaddr are visible on the blockchain like taddr are. they are not
the way it works is that each node has a set of zaddr/privkey pairs in their wallet
then for EVERY ztransaction, they try to decrypt it. if they can, it is a transaction for that wallet and it is processed
so the zadddr exists in the blockchain only by being able to decrypt transactions encrypted to that zaddr


[07-Oct-18 02:19 AM] Mylo#8306
Are all these statements correct @jl777c ?

the zaddr is only known to exist if:
 - you are the person that holds the privkey
 - you sent funds to a zaddr owned by someone else
 - you publish the zaddr somewhere for others to see (e.g. the web)

the blockchain properties of PIRATE (or any z-only blockchain):
 - no amounts are disclosed except for the block reward to the miner which goes to a t-addr and then from that t-addr are shielded to a z-addr known only to the person doing the shielding
 - the transactions details (sender/receiver) are encrypted, not viewable by a third party
 - only the node/wallet with the privkeys to decrypt a transaction can see transaction details


[07-Oct-18 06:44 AM] jl777c#5810
no


[07-Oct-18 06:46 AM] jl777c#5810
it is asymmetric. the sender will know both their zaddr and the destination zaddr, amount, txid. but the receiver wont know what zaddr sent the funds to them, well not easily. maybe it is possible to know this, but on the receive side the txid/amount/memo are all that is visible


[07-Oct-18 07:02 AM] jl777c#5810
probably it is possible for the destination node to determine who sent though, so I am not sure on this point


[07-Oct-18 07:44 AM] Mylo#8306
Ok thanks.  I‚Äôll double check between nodes and revise the point form summary.  Cheers


[07-Oct-18 08:09 AM] FishyGuts#5085

i think that was your friend @FishyGuts

I know the guy yes.  I think that is fair, especially since it started as a winner take all üòÉ


[07-Oct-18 09:53 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Wookie knows he didn't break the rules, but that he may have walked the plank outside the spirit of the competition... and therefore the prize reduction is fine.


[07-Oct-18 09:53 AM] FishyGuts#5085
It's a temp logo and we will certainly work the more popular P eyepatch into the final design since it was popular with the community overall.

@webworker01 We have an issue with `komodod.exe`. it crashes when we issue `komodo-cli.exe -ac_name=PIRATE help`. Would you please have a look if you can identify the issue when you have some time?

[08-Oct-18 03:14 AM] CHMEX#0686
Two ideas let me know what you think. Ultimate goal is to increase the trx count on PIRATE.
- I can setup a (fee) nodes that just sends trx to the network. 1440 trx per node per day is possible. 
- Setup a faucet that sends little ARRR. 
Both increases the trx count.


[08-Oct-18 03:16 AM] jl777c#5810
i think the onboarding bots will do this for us


[08-Oct-18 03:17 AM] jl777c#5810
if you can detect a repeat usage and limit it to 0.777 KMD in that case, it seems we will get all the spam tx we want and paid for by the onboarder

it will consume a lot of CPU resources though, so adjust the pricing as needed to cover the incremental cost


[08-Oct-18 06:00 AM] webworker01#3884
yes for some reason `komodo-cli -ac_name=PIRATE help` crashes komodod, will make a debug build, found my notes


[08-Oct-18 06:04 AM] jl777c#5810
in windows only as far as I have heard


[08-Oct-18 06:06 AM] webworker01#3884
yes, well i don't have a mac to test that but worked fine in ubuntu


[08-Oct-18 06:45 AM] SHossain#0007
i'll test the macOS version today


[08-Oct-18 08:17 AM] webworker01#3884
apparently my notes weren't good enough, getting `configure: error: libdb_cxx headers missing, Bitcoin Core requires this library for wallet functionality (--disable-wallet to disable wallet functionality)` on both ubuntu 16 and 18 machines when trying compile for win


[08-Oct-18 08:18 AM] webworker01#3884
fwiw i'm pretty sure the issue is not just for pirate, i tried to run help with HODL and it also crashed komodod on win


[08-Oct-18 08:20 AM] SHossain#0007
are you following these steps for cross-compile?
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config libc6-dev m4 g++-multilib autoconf libtool ncurses-dev unzip git python python-zmq zlib1g-dev wget libcurl4-openssl-dev bsdmainutils automake curl cmake mingw-w64
curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
git clone https://github.com/jl777/komodo --branch jl777 --single-branch
cd komodo
./zcutil/fetch-params.sh
# -j8 = using 8 threads for the compilation - replace 8 with number of threads you want to use
./zcutil/build-win.sh -j8
#This can take some time.
```


[08-Oct-18 08:20 AM] webworker01#3884
not exactly that but close, the error seems to be related to berkleydb version

I want ALL your input though. I am not familiar with all the ways people can game systems so I need your guys skilled input too on that.


[09-Oct-18 12:39 AM] Mylo#8306
Or twitter. That way you can tweet and mention them saying thanks for playing, appreesh and pride, bragging etc about getting one from coin team... dunno...yeah u need to work out the gamifying and feedback loop for community involvement or stickiness.

Screenshots, yeah


[09-Oct-18 12:40 AM] FishyGuts#5085
and after a month of playing they have $25 and bam.. a new crypto user, in the Komodo ecosystem.


[09-Oct-18 12:41 AM] FishyGuts#5085
This isn't next month or anything.  There is alot to it but I want to have it all go with the Onboarding bonuses that JL has concocted.


[09-Oct-18 12:42 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I really gotta hit the hay but keep the ideas and suggestions coming.  I am all ears.

See you guys tomorrow.


[09-Oct-18 12:43 AM] Mylo#8306
Double your loot will be good with quiz/education but harder than just a simple shooter.  If u had translations in Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai probably good for the unbanked.  But maybe better when tortuga is up, teach benefit of trade to kmd which can be spent in many more places


[09-Oct-18 12:44 AM] FishyGuts#5085
We have Spanish and Phillipine transaltors for the unbanked areas.


[09-Oct-18 12:44 AM] FishyGuts#5085
And yes, an exchange is critical and even if I started today< I proabbly wouldn't finish before tortuga.

@webworker01 is it crashing because you are cross compiling?  Are you following instructions from anywhere?


[10-Oct-18 01:40 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Somehow I missed this being late to the party maybe but... are our transactions run through TOR?

They can be if you configure it to


[10-Oct-18 01:50 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Got it.   But not by default, correct?  Not like Kovri for monero?


[10-Oct-18 01:51 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Or is that optional? *doesnt use monero*


[10-Oct-18 01:59 AM] jl777c#5810
tor is optional


[10-Oct-18 01:59 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure if we have tor nodes setup yet


[10-Oct-18 01:59 AM] jl777c#5810
it is not such a priority as it is just ztransactions, but more privacy is better if you are able to arrange it


[10-Oct-18 02:15 AM] FishyGuts#5085
It‚Äôs now on the list.

@FishyGuts which logo you want to use on the video?


[10-Oct-18 03:13 AM] FishyGuts#5085
We will use Wookies.  I‚Äôve already used the others on he more visited coin info sites.  The final images should be a couple weeks.


[10-Oct-18 03:27 AM] SHossain#0007
ok. please let me know once you finalize one to use for the Agama video

[10-Oct-18 04:07 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I have put it on the list.   I mean, if that is available to users, then there is even more privacy surrounding the coin and it's use, correct?

I would basically need a few scattered servers running komodod + TOR correct?

[10-Oct-18 02:59 PM] FishyGuts#5085
People seem to like it. 
It can be used in ANY discord, so I urge you guys to share it.   Other people seeing KMD tips in other discords will only get them talking.


[10-Oct-18 02:59 PM] FishyGuts#5085
It's a fun distraction and encourages interaction.

Let's start tipping in other cross connected discord channels. people will be interested


[10-Oct-18 03:00 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I posted in about 10-12 asset channels they can use it on their private discords.


[10-Oct-18 03:00 PM] FishyGuts#5085
The only issue is that the discord admins have to add the KMD tipbot first like we did this morning.

[10-Oct-18 03:04 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, i have seen them. i did a thunder in #verus . it seems the bridge is broken now. otherwise, it would have been visible in Verus discord as well

Basically.   Any discord can add this bot.  If you‚Äôre an admin of the bitcoin discord you can add this bot and people can tip in KMD on that discord.

[10-Oct-18 04:40 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I responded as such:
None whatsoever that I know of.   
We could have a dev on the team helping them out but being open source and decentralized, it‚Äôs fine.

In our opinion, it seems like it is a cash grab.  

- Zcash parameters only provide privacy as much as people use it.  Pirate requires z tx‚Äôs only making the shielded pool 99,9% of the total funds on the chain.    With Zcash, currently about 4% of the pool of funds are shielded.  https://explorer.zcha.in/statistics/value 

- Masternodes are a farce and everyone just copies DASH with nearly no additional functionality or use.  MNs provide a false sense of decentralization since all of the nodes are likely run from the same 3 or 4 VPN providers.  In addition, it‚Äôs just a way for people to feel like a coin with no use has value‚Ä¶ until the dev team or sales team can hopefully come up with a use case.  Any baked in functionality specific to MNs and not the chain itself is usually a step towards centralization.  

- Staking‚Ä¶ But why?   Nothing is truly at stake and it‚Äôs just a fancy way of ‚Äúadding‚Äù value to a coin where there is none.

I hope I didn‚Äôt offend or go in to deep.

[12-Oct-18 04:37 AM] FishyGuts#5085
For the swap bot... he is going to make an escrow bot version for OTC trades but we might be on DigitalPrice by then.  

The swap bot was something cool I thought maybe KMD could use when porting new projects Into the ecosystem.

[12-Oct-18 08:15 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Pirates purpose is to allow financial privacy.   With the massive increase in divorce and child support cases,  men worldwide are being raked through the coals with the assistance and force of governments who utilize their access to individual financial statements to levy outrageous and unfair collections.   Pirate gives a way for completely private finances.   Double edged sword,  some misanthropes may use it to completely fuck over dependents ,  but it prevents a lot of men from what is essentially slavery.

[14-Oct-18 06:26 AM] jl777c#5810
what faucet portal?


[14-Oct-18 07:00 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I‚Äôm having one made


[14-Oct-18 07:01 AM] FishyGuts#5085
It will require an email to proceed and people can opt into the mailing list - it takes you to a faucet page and I was wondering if this could be an all in one portal.   
For onboarding purchasing and the referral tracking.


[14-Oct-18 07:01 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Where people can go to see their stats and such.


[14-Oct-18 07:01 AM] jl777c#5810
the onboarding site needs to be optimized for maximum clickrate, etc. so clearly it needs to be more than the current text only


[14-Oct-18 07:02 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure email required is the best way for referrals


[14-Oct-18 07:03 AM] FishyGuts#5085
For referrals, I assume you want to use wallet addresses then?    

Basically my thought is to put the onboarding and referral program on the portal - as a stepped process.


[14-Oct-18 07:03 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I thought emails would be a harder way to spoof multiple accounts into the portal.


[14-Oct-18 07:03 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I can understand the privacy thing but anyone truly concerned would be using a burner email anyway right?

[14-Oct-18 07:04 AM] jl777c#5810
the referral system is designed so that unlimited usage of it is actually good


[14-Oct-18 07:04 AM] jl777c#5810
it can be on the same page, just dont require email for onboarding


[14-Oct-18 07:04 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I meant unlimited usage by the same user.


[14-Oct-18 07:05 AM] FishyGuts#5085

[14-Oct-18 07:06 AM] jl777c#5810
it does create direct demand for more PIRATE, which is what it is all about


[14-Oct-18 07:06 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Speaking of z tx- the bot is all over it.   We‚Äôre changing thunder to cannon - which hits three people ( z tx - 3 )


[14-Oct-18 07:07 AM] FishyGuts#5085
He will batch all rain and soak txs


[14-Oct-18 07:08 AM] FishyGuts#5085
It will be great for tx count boost.  @dukeleto I also wanted to do the transactions comparison page.     I want the pie charts to be globes and the shielded tx s are the water.. and unshielded is land.

I think you might be right.


[14-Oct-18 11:49 PM] jl777c#5810
he was able to get a longer private chain for BTCP. just logistics issues


[14-Oct-18 11:49 PM] jl777c#5810
but PIRATE is doubly safe due to its high hashrate and dPoW


[14-Oct-18 11:59 PM] FishyGuts#5085
He would have needed 120MS to longer chain us and it would have been a close dance between notarizations and pirate block times.


[14-Oct-18 11:59 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Would be interesting to see dPoW in action live.


[15-Oct-18 12:00 AM] jl777c#5810
but the exchange waiting for a notarization before crediting deposit, so there is no gain to being able to double spend


[15-Oct-18 12:00 AM] jl777c#5810
as if you double spend before your deposit is credited, then it is an invalid deposit and you wont get credited


[15-Oct-18 12:01 AM] jl777c#5810
if you dont double spend before the deposit is notarized, then the deposit is locked in and cant be double spent


[15-Oct-18 12:06 AM] FishyGuts#5085
True.   I don‚Äôt think he was trying to cause harm, I think he was trying to showcase security flaws.

Did i read the PIRATE modifications will make all tx on-chain?  And this is aimed at making more privacy?

I have not deposited.  only whatever gets rained/thunder etc.

it is internal balance you got from all the rains


[15-Oct-18 05:39 AM] jl777c#5810
since you didnt make a deposit, there is no activity on the deposit address

Would love to have a volume and price ticker on pirate.black

digital price doesnt generate deposit address


[15-Oct-18 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
i see it did, but it generated and Raddress, wont work


[15-Oct-18 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
they need to use z_getnewaddress instead of getnewaddress


[15-Oct-18 08:37 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Just informed him.


[15-Oct-18 08:38 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems they didnt understand anything about zaddr support


[15-Oct-18 08:38 AM] jl777c#5810
z_getnewaddress is the absolute simplest


[15-Oct-18 08:41 AM] FishyGuts#5085
He rushed through it it seems.  Said two weeks and took 4 days.   I understand they aren‚Äôt busy but let‚Äôs see how fast he can resolve this.

@jorian wordpress has a lot of features. i tried to setup few other pages and been busy with some other testing. probably, after i become free of my current testing schedules, i can look into the site and modify it as much as i can. i'm good with WP backend mostly

we have purchased the premium theme and another plugin and we can customize as we want it.

@CHMEX do you have some time to modify the site?

@FishyGuts there are some specific improvements for PIRATE (Z tx based coin) in this agama version. do you want to announce?


[25-Oct-18 08:04 AM] SHossain#0007
- no t address creation using Agama for PIRATE only
- better display placement of the z addr when sending tx, it used to overlap

Has to be static HTML design 
With written consent 
Host it on GitHub 
Later turn that to CMS using same HTML design

Even a list won't solve all issues.
Hopefully DWY will have his solution ready or DigPri will wrap up.  It's 6 AM where they are so maybe todays gonna be a productive day for them.

@Senda - if you want to study - google ‚ÄúNetwork attack XVG‚Äù and go to the bitcoin talk forum thread.   There are people in there who discuss the time warp attack and what it is/how it works.

Have the faucet direct to the dice game after they get their coins to play?
Is it arrr compatible or only KMD?

Dice CC is not compatible with KMD neither PIRATE for now

at least there used to be, satinder made a blog post about the origins

Are we able to mention the creators.  I know some people were wary at first.  Hopefully we‚Äôve shifted the mindset.

it seems a lot of url are missing from the new site?


[02-Nov-18 08:49 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I think @grewalsatinder was initially worried about the implications and issues with a negative connotation on privacy coins.   They wanted to ensure a delineation between KMD devs and Pirate Devs.   

That is my take on it.   I am sure he has a more elaborate reason.

[02-Nov-18 10:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
devs push code to git repo


[02-Nov-18 10:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Miners mine the block on the software compiled from this code


[02-Nov-18 10:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
So both devs and miners are controllers


[02-Nov-18 10:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Major control I guess coming from devs


[02-Nov-18 10:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Then again those who are authorised to control git repo still can not be treatas full control


[02-Nov-18 10:18 PM] FishyGuts#5085

[05-Nov-18 02:25 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I might need Pirate more than KMD soon.  A couple of things in the works.  
Might be looking to coin swap a community with 1000+ people in it, into Pirate.


[05-Nov-18 02:37 AM] jl777c#5810
what does that mean? "coin swap a community"


[05-Nov-18 02:38 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Say a coin dies but the community doesn't.


[05-Nov-18 02:39 AM] FishyGuts#5085
You can basically "buy" them by offering a swap.  Say, 100-1 or  1000-1 or something.  They get SOMETHING for their "dead" tokens.... and they can either a, sell them to the market, or b, be excited about a new project and their "newfound free" money after they already wrote it off.


[05-Nov-18 02:40 AM] jl777c#5810
interesting!


[05-Nov-18 02:40 AM] FishyGuts#5085
So if a chain say, has 10M circ supply, you can set aside 100K coins to swap them at 100-1


[05-Nov-18 02:40 AM] FishyGuts#5085

[05-Nov-18 02:41 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Also my comment about needing more pirate thgan KMD was to CHMEX and his offer from the onboarding .  Just to clarify.


[05-Nov-18 02:41 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Have a great night everyone.  Off to bed.  2:40 here.

One of the admins works on ETHos the mining management platform.    That‚Äôs huge.


[05-Nov-18 03:04 AM] jorian#4555
cool


[05-Nov-18 03:04 AM] jorian#4555
how much PIRATE would you need for that


[05-Nov-18 03:08 AM] CHMEX#0686
That sounds like a great idea.
Swap and than burn could also be done via a website like the onboarding.
If you need the pirates let me know and I 'swap it back'


[05-Nov-18 03:08 AM] CHMEX#0686

Would it be a good idea to add ZEN/ horizon as a payment option the the onboarding site?


[05-Nov-18 05:03 AM] CHMEX#0686
Onboarding price respects now the dp ask price rounded to two decimals


[05-Nov-18 07:20 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Haha that would be funny.  Adding zen to buy with.

[05-Nov-18 03:06 PM] CHMEX#0686
The 'key' to view the stats is the zaddress.
I'm thinking also on that maybe a special code can be generated ( like I gave one to Duke for TresureChest )
Making sure you own that address maybe I can work with the viewingkey. You if you provide the viewing key you get some extra power on the address like changing the referrallink and later execute a payout if it did not reach the minimum payout limit yet.

[06-Nov-18 06:31 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Deeper Dive:
- Why did you choose to update the halving time rewards by 5x?
- Was there any pre-mine?
- How much of total supply is held by the team?
- Do you see any problem with using dPoW from working with Komodo and not only miner rewards but notary adresses being transparent, and all in all why did you choose to build on the Komodo Platform?

 Flashy Gordy
 *edit (last question)
- Do you see any problem with using dPoW from working with Komodo and now not only miner rewards but also notary adresses being transparent, and all in all why did you choose to build on the Komodo Platform?

4h 4 hours ago
Also if u feel like answering any of these questions, would be nice too:

- Will ARRR get an own wallet?

- Will it be techically possible to make mobile wallets one day?

- Will ARRR further "emancipate" from KMD, for example, getting an OWN discord channel?

- Will the obligatory privacy cause trouble with exchanges? For example if you make a deposit to an exchange address but they don't credit it... How can you even show you sent it?

- How is the progress with getting on coinlib and coinmarketcap and when will it be listed on crex24?


[06-Nov-18 06:31 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I can get to these later but any help would be greatly appreciated.

so what is the future of pirate? :p


[06-Nov-18 07:48 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Private commerce / exchange.


[06-Nov-18 07:49 AM] FishyGuts#5085

it's a bit sparse but you can work out most things from there


[08-Nov-18 09:11 AM] CHMEX#0686
You can also transmit messages with that I think there is a Memo Field


[08-Nov-18 03:05 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@jl777c - I Have Justin Ehrenhofer asking a few questions.   I believe you would be the best to field this one perhaps.  
I have some ideas on answers but this one is best left to the pros.

*Let me preface by saying that I generally support the idea of making fully-shielded transactions mandatory for a number of reasons, so I think we are generally on the same page there
 However, I really do not understand the design decision to build this asset on top of Komodo. I admittedly am not intimately familiar with Komodo, but I do not understand the advantages here. I can only think of disadvantages*


[08-Nov-18 03:08 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I like to think of Komodo like eth.. only better in lots of ways... AND unlike eth... the projects launched on KMD have dev support unlike ETH.


[08-Nov-18 03:09 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I think if he understood KMD better he would understand why Pirate is benefitted by this decision.


[08-Nov-18 03:10 PM] jl777c#5810
dPoW


[08-Nov-18 03:10 PM] jl777c#5810
arguably makes PIRATE more secure than XMR


[08-Nov-18 03:10 PM] jl777c#5810
what is hard to understand?


[08-Nov-18 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
100Msol is not bad, but it is nothing compared to ZEC hashrate and not even visible compared to BTC


[08-Nov-18 03:11 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Give me the elevator pitch on why it‚Äôs better to launch  an asset chain under KMD.   DPoW is the only reason?


[08-Nov-18 03:12 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Xmr is what.  500 MS?


[08-Nov-18 03:13 PM] webworker01#3884
By building ARRR with Komodo technology, we've instantly inherited all of KMD's benefits, in particular adding dPoW security to our chain to reduce the impact of 51% attacks. 

Komodo's technology allows developers to create runtime forks (Komodo Independent Assetchains) which are not tied to the Komodo blockchain except when they choose to add dPoW security.   Future updates to the Komodo codebase will be easily inherited by ARRR including the Sapling upgrade.


[08-Nov-18 03:13 PM] jl777c#5810
dPoW built in, always improving codebase inherited from KMD


[08-Nov-18 03:14 PM] jl777c#5810
so drastically reduced development efforts, orders of magnitude more security. what other platform gets even one of those? let alone both


[08-Nov-18 03:14 PM] jl777c#5810
also what is more important than chain security?


[08-Nov-18 05:13 PM] FishyGuts#5085

 Justin Ehrenhofer
Sounds like a roundabout way to do merged mining without the mining
 Is that the main advantage? Komodo's network security?


[08-Nov-18 05:15 PM] jl777c#5810
you cant force a miner to merge mine, and with thousands of coins the process becomes very difficult to recruit enough miners to get a meaningful hashrate


[08-Nov-18 05:16 PM] jl777c#5810
with dPoW, the miner has no choice


[08-Nov-18 05:16 PM] jl777c#5810
so yes, if you can convince all of the bitcoin miners to mine your small chain that might not even have any trading market, then maybe dPoW isnt needed


[08-Nov-18 05:17 PM] jl777c#5810
but the practical reality is that the miners can merge mine only so many coins and there is no assurance a new coin will be able to get enough merge mining hashrate


[08-Nov-18 05:17 PM] jl777c#5810
with dPoW 100% of BTC hashrate is involved


[09-Nov-18 11:11 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Wy did we update the halving rewards?


[09-Nov-18 11:31 PM] FishyGuts#5085

http://pad.supernet.org/fishy_questions


[10-Nov-18 03:26 AM] jl777c#5810
the original emission schedule was too fast and would have created (justified) complaints that the early miners got all the 256 reward blocks. With the current emission, there is plenty of time for miners to decide to mine or not and later they have only themselves to blame for not mining the 256 blocks. With the halving to 128, then 64, 32.. over the next 2 years, these days of 256 PIRATE block rewards will be missed.


[11-Nov-18 03:20 AM] FishyGuts#5085

Q: why does the world need ARRR? -> i would remove that first sentence and start right off with `the world NEEDS privacy`


[11-Nov-18 06:59 AM] jorian#4555
(they just don't know it yet)


[11-Nov-18 07:00 AM] jorian#4555
the rest of that part is a bit cliche though


[11-Nov-18 07:02 AM] jorian#4555
nice analogy with the house


[11-Nov-18 07:09 AM] jorian#4555
```We chose to build on Komodo because they provide an out of the box solution to start a blockchain, and because many of the developers and advisors are intimately familiar with it.``` thats not entirely true though.. we didn't choose komodo, komodo chose us


[11-Nov-18 07:09 AM] jorian#4555
because of the -ac_private parameter we started experimenting


[11-Nov-18 07:09 AM] jorian#4555
result: ARRR


[11-Nov-18 07:12 AM] jorian#4555
about that emancipation part: of course there will come a time when ARRR deserves its own discord. but that's more for marketing


[11-Nov-18 07:12 AM] jorian#4555
only on that part will ARRR emancipate imo


[11-Nov-18 07:12 AM] jorian#4555
it will not move away from KMD tech


[11-Nov-18 07:16 AM] jorian#4555
also, there are too many people complaining about ARRR being tied to the komodo ecosystem and seeing that as a bad thing. maybe he'll ask that question too in the interview, and it must be made clear that being in the KMD ecosystem is always better than being alone in the dark. dPoW, bunch of devs, fast integration into existing tech etc


[11-Nov-18 07:16 AM] jorian#4555
so instead of a weakness, being tied to KMD is a strength


[11-Nov-18 09:58 AM] FishyGuts#5085

[11-Nov-18 10:26 AM] FishyGuts#5085

i tried to do this and after entering receiving address it just sent me back to the initial form


[13-Nov-18 11:48 PM] FishyGuts#5085

it can be treated as alternative website


[19-Nov-18 12:48 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
but I haven't notified anyone about it


[19-Nov-18 12:48 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
just did the domain setup work yesterday


[19-Nov-18 12:48 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
have mixed thought about it telling people as the project name is different and this domain is different


[19-Nov-18 12:49 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
what you guys think?


[19-Nov-18 01:02 PM] SHossain#0007
we have some great WP and PHP devs working on the site :)
the WP dev made infamous https://xda-developers.com
before i came to crypto, i used to lurk on XDA forum


[19-Nov-18 01:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
nice!!!!


[19-Nov-18 01:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I leave it to @FishyGuts to decide if this alternative website needs to be told to public or not.


[19-Nov-18 01:16 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Wrong dude to ask üòõ


[19-Nov-18 01:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
let me know if not, I'll disable it's pearl.black domain link


[19-Nov-18 01:16 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I would ask the reasoning I guess is why.


[19-Nov-18 01:17 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Just for vintage reference?


[19-Nov-18 01:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
wordpress - official team
github - community


[19-Nov-18 01:17 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I know the existing iteration isn't great but we're on it hard now üòõ


[19-Nov-18 01:17 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Oh you mean community can mod it?


[19-Nov-18 01:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
exactly


[19-Nov-18 01:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
anyone on the web can just push changes to website


[19-Nov-18 01:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
all the team can do is moderate


[19-Nov-18 01:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
accept or deny those changes


[19-Nov-18 01:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
that's not the case with wordpress


[22-Nov-18 01:57 PM] SHossain#0007

*What is Pirate?
Pirate (ARRR) is a cryptocurrency that solves the issue of financial privacy on the blockchain.  
Unlike most other cryptocurrencies which use a public ledger of data, transactions on the Pirate network are required to be private.  This means that your financial data remains in your control, that your transactions are always anonymous and there is absolutely no residual footprint left behind.  
The importance of financial privacy becomes more and more evident every day and Pirate provides this much needed tool to users in an easy to use fashion.  One of our goals to continually ease the use of such products for people in everyday life, so that they do not need to work for their privacy.

Pirate is not only the most private cryptocurrency in existence today, it is also the most secure. 
We use a security mechanism called delayed Proof of Work.  This is essentially a backup copy of our blockchain written into each Bitcoin block.  This means that Pirate is protected against damage from double spends and 51% attacks on the network.  If you want to attack Pirate, you have to attack Bitcoin first. 

Pirate is open source and practically free to use.  It was selflessly created by a team of developers for the community. There is no pre-mine, no founder fund, no developer tax. 
Everything about Pirate is 100% fundamentally complete and owned by the community of users.  We look forward to your company on this voyage to financial privacy.*

Good morning,
If you opened our webpage and saw that.... 
How would you feel?  
What would you change?
Let's get this laced up today.  
I appreciate all of your input.

>>This is essentially a backup copy of our blockchain written into each Bitcoin block.
This might be misunderstood it's just a hash not the complete chain backedup to BTC.
( english is not my native language so maybe it is totally ok in English)


[26-Nov-18 10:10 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I understand that .  Is there an easier way to exp,ain to people who dont know what dPoW is?


[26-Nov-18 10:10 AM] FishyGuts#5085
for the website initial contact iand prject info.


[26-Nov-18 03:00 PM] CHMEX#0686
Its really diffucult to describe. Here my try.

This is essentially storing a current checkpoint of PIRATE chain into each Bitcoin block. After its confirmed on Bitcoin the PIRATE chain can't be rolled back past that same checkpoint.

@CHMEX latest FSM branch fixes the getsnapshot rpc, at least it looks good from the tests


[27-Nov-18 01:30 AM] CHMEX#0686
great thanks a lot I will test it once changes are in piratenetwork repo


[28-Nov-18 03:33 AM] CHMEX#0686
It worked thank you for the fix


[28-Nov-18 03:39 AM] jl777c#5810
it was all miket


[04-Dec-18 09:42 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Ok.....  Time to set sail Pirates. 
We've built the new discord and we want to get all of us migrated over there.  We have radio, and tip bots and will get a bridge to the one remaining Pirate channel in KMD discord once everyone sets sail.  

TODAY THE INVITE BOUNTY STARTS!!!!  
So get your ref link and lets annoy everyone on social media platforms from Instagram to Twitter, FB to Gab, Reddit to Steemit!
