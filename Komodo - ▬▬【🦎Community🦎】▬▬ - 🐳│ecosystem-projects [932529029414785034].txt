The HempCoin ($THC) was one of the first 30 cryptocurrencies founded in 2014. We are building a supply tracking platform for the Agricultural Industry spotlighting Hemp in its first iteration. Growers will be able to know what they are doing per day/week/harvest and have real time forecasting/analytics on a mobile device.

We like to extend our hands in cooperation, as we bring many capabilities to the table. For instance accepting cryptocurrency payments in 75+ coins for 0% fees both online and instore, then trading those into an fiat currency globally (dollars, pounds, pesos, rubles, yen) at a .3% fee

$THC has massive connections throughout the Hemp & Cannabis space, and would love to connect to dive deeper into our synergies.

:Tokel: **The future of tokenization** :Tokel: 

Tokel is a unique idea, an NFT and Token creation platform like no other. The core mission is to make it easy for everyone to launch and manage a token or NFT for any use.

Tokel is building a decentralized token platform. Using :KMD:  Komodo Technologies as the core foundation, Tokel will be offering end-to-end token solutions for fixed supply and non-fungible tokens (NFT‚Äôs).

You can buy, hold and trade Tokel ( $TKL ) on AtomicDEX üòé

haven't submitted any PR or request, but I keep an eye on projects around different ecosystems occasionally.
I just sense they may not accept it.
Luke is not the owner or leader of the project, but a co-creator of it who played huge role to the success of Umbrel.
It has become a high profile project by now, because of it's quality.
There is NO harm for making a PR to it on Github. Just do it and see how things go.
whatever I think shouldn't be the reason to not give it a try.

webdex being an independent web based dex, can load it's app from a website URL to client's own computer browser when accessed. It is still decentralised DEX.
but as previously seen DeFi DEXs can be unaccessible due to DNS level issues, of N number of reasons. Temporarily or Permanently.
The best would be to host it on any of your local network computer and access it via browser within your own network.
That way no such power in the world can ban or stop you from using an easy to access DEX app.
And for that reason, Umbrel is **perfect** to such DEX app.
It makes 100% sense to push for it's adoption with platforms such as Umbrel.

How much would it cost  in time and money to make that happen?

wait for Webdex being available publicly, and its source code with advanced install instructions available for tech enthusiasts who don't wish to access and use it from provided Komodo's own URL.
once you have it, you can easily create a Docker setup, and submit it to Umbrel.

New update v0.3.2 for HW KMD Wallet Tool
Both web and desktop
https://github.com/pbca26/hw-kmd-wallet/releases/tag/v0.3.2

Changes:
- Explicitly display claimed KMD rewards in transaction history
- Check if local data cache is up to date to prevent partial KMD rewards claiming
- Minor bug fixes

**Desktop app users:** this update is optional and is targeted towards KMD holders so if you're using asset chains you can skip it

Wouldn't it be good for an even better use case for komodo holder if you share the fees what you get if you hold komodo?
