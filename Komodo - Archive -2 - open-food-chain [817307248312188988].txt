Welcome to the Open-Food-Chain channel. The first food provenance chain we built with Komodo tech will launch public as Juicychain. Check https://juicychain.org for information.

In this channel we will keep you up to date. Juicychain is in private beta and will hit production (and public beta) soon. Meanwhile work is done on soy and fish / fish feed. With Juicychain big European industry players (Refresco & Eckes Granini) are on board. The project is an industry initiative, not owned by one or few corporates like this was mostly the case in the past.

@barv this might be interesting too for tea. Are best practices shared how to setup such as initiative with multiple players and Komodo?


[05-Mar-21 06:53 AM] barv#0867
Hi @Jurjen , certainly. We should get on a call üôÇ

Hello @barv & @Mylo 
Do you think that open-food-chain/juicychain would accept donations from future NN operators ? (asking for a friend)


[30-Mar-21 06:28 PM] Mylo#8306
Good question!!?!!


[31-Mar-21 03:16 AM] phm87#7395
Individuals may accept any income but for companies, it can be difficult to declare and define donations from NN in accounting


[04-Apr-21 12:51 PM] phm87#7395
I was brainstorming on this ... if it can be difficult that open-food-chain/juicychain accepts directly NN donations (for fiscal and accounting reasons), maybe it is possible to create a multisig between individuals, aim of funds received would be to support the fan club of open-food-chain/juicychain. Sorry to brainstorm here


[04-Apr-21 08:39 PM] Mylo#8306
All good


[04-Apr-21 08:39 PM] Mylo#8306
openfood is an open source project


[04-Apr-21 08:40 PM] Mylo#8306
juicychain is an implementation & managed service of the openfood project


[04-Apr-21 08:40 PM] Mylo#8306
anyone (a business or an auditing NGO) can participate in the juicychain by using openfood to connect and do what they need


[04-Apr-21 08:41 PM] Mylo#8306
so....in my opinion, openfood can receive donations for community bounties based on freely available capabilities/functions that are common to any supply-chain based workflow/project


[04-Apr-21 08:42 PM] Mylo#8306
but maybe that multisig idea is better for an ecosystem-wide concept.


[04-Apr-21 08:42 PM] Mylo#8306
and it maybe that "community spending fund" can extend/grow after it is started.


[15-Apr-21 12:39 PM] barv#0867
Yeah. I guess that is right @Mylo . It can be nice to have a fund from which bounties can be paid to add interesting features. However, it's still a bit early in the game. Juicychain is yet to launch

#Blockchains are poised to create the #internet of #value. Well, are they? If we don‚Äôt want #silos of value, but a true internet of value, blockchains need to be #interoperable. Read on our vision (@TheNewFork) and how we use @KomodoPlatform #Komodo  https://t.co/oUj7UGFsUc

I am looking at the functional use of NFTs with the OFC in how to reward initial investors.

Some ideas are access to conference for life of holding NFT, intros to speakers etc for biz dev etc.

The strike2 summit is once per year, but once OFC is launched, looking at 1 per quarter.

Pre covid it was held in NL, but after looking to do it physically in different parts of the world.

What if ü§î the means to produce #food was co-owned between the #farmers and the public through fractional ownership using #Blockchain - equipment & logistics, crop maintenance practices, additional labour based on yield. The possibilities are endless @StrikeTwoSummit @TheNewFork
