@everyone **Open Discussion About Our Brand Architecture**

_Let's continue the discussion we started on #atomicdefi-discussion._

We went back to the drawing table during the past two weeks and made a review of the situation. The goal is to simplify our product-brand architecture so that we can do effective marketing. I would say this is the most crucial decision in 2020.

We believe our proposal is solid, but of course, we might have overlooked something. We are looking for feedback about the overall structure and more naming ideas. 

We can find the best decision when we come together as a community. I know there are many bright minds among us who have a lot of insight. We are eager to hear from everyone.

Here is the part 1 update I shared a few days ago.

The way I see it, our main problem is that we have already to much products for new participants to overlook. So what we technically need is a starting point.

I'd call it: The Komodo Crypto Gateway

That way everybody who wants to start getting involved in crypto, intuitivly knows what app/program to download.

Once there, they should have the option to put together the modules they want. Like in pinterest where you can select your interests to get the filtered results.  That way the initial gateway has the same composability like antara does. And new users get the chanch to get familiar working with modules.

Modules within the gateway could be, the atomicdex for the trading crowd, the atomicdefi for the financing (investors and developers). And a toolkit module(Antara framework). We technically would also need a app store module, where developers can market their products and investors track the sales or metrics that sales are based on. A knowledge module, that provides acces to the websides of komodo that supply the participants with knowledge. A communication module (basically a chatroom). And a gaming module (culd be separated from the appstore once the appstore has a high number of games). 

It would also be possible to build partnerships with other crypto participants e.g binance and provide the users of Komodo Gateway acess to their cex accounts combined with the ability to withdraw their coins from cexes to the atomic dex wallet.

(Btw. The atomic dex should be called AtomicDexWallet because new user are getting told that they need a wallet to start in crypto, looking for a wallet they won't find atomic dex as an alternative right from the start but the atomic dex app pretty much is a wallet with an integrated exchange like shapshift was when I started in crypto)

> I'd call it: The Komodo Crypto Gateway

I like the name, a gateway to crypto. We are quite hesitant to rename AtomicDEX though. It already got a following and buzz. People are aware of the name.

This is a good point!


[15-Sep-20 06:20 AM] richardt#2807
I somewhat disagree. The problem is that we still have no products that are production ready and reliable enough for mass usage. The main focus right now should be to appeal to devs/testers to get some of the products to that stage.


[15-Sep-20 06:21 AM] richardt#2807
This requires lots of demos and presentations to get these people excited to work on these products. 

Need to work the angle that there's great and promising tech, but we need help to get to the finish line. A little honesty and humility could go a long ways...


[15-Sep-20 06:26 AM] Sebastian76#6161
I believe, every product, has to have its own marketing because they are getting different from eachother, but with easy step over to other products of ours. Meaning, that if an user finished his/her wallet activity, to easily get over to eventually invest, speculate with the coins him or her owns. 
Why?
                 Because then the full focus can be given to them in terms of marketing, as well as the emphasis on different products is different every time. I mean, it is important to understand, DeFi needs a push, whereas other parts of the projects need less attention atm. Nonetheless, the focus on one product will generate hype and attraction for other investors, who can then see what more we have got beyond DeFi. This is only an example. This will also make the whole marketing strategy, more flexible and cheaper, thus competitive advantage can be gained. 
                 Basic users tend to freak out if something is, or looks difficult, or its structure is complex, with a lot of stuff in them. You don't want to push a whole cake in their mouths, you need to feed them bit by bit.
                 I do have some more remarks about the whole Komodo pack, but the time and space is very limited to put them in words in a chat.

@richardt Good points!

> Need to work the angle that there's great and promising tech, but we need help to get to the finish line. A little honesty and humility could go a long ways...

I hope this new product-brand hierarchy reflects that and paints an accurate description about the products we have to offer and where our focus is. It is a lot simpler from the current situation, and we would cut-down on tech terms and names we currently use.

> I somewhat disagree. 

I wasn't sure what you were referring to so  Ican't comment further.

_ _
> I believe, every product, has to have its own marketing because they are getting different from eachother

@Sebastian76 yes that's how I see it. Each product-brand has a different audience that requires a different explanation. Or we have to have two product-brands for the same audience if the use case & technology stack is entirely different. Example:

Komodo Custom Contracts – used to create consensus enforced contracts for UTXO blockchains
Komodo Composed – used to launch purpose-built blockchains
Komodo DeFi Engine – used to develop cross-protocol applications

> Because then the full focus can be given to them in terms of marketing, as well as the emphasis on different products is different every time.

@Mylo Agreed, and by simplifying our product-brand architecture and terminology we can create those explicit pathways and direct developers there. Right now we are lacking focus, and a lot of the technologies we have talked about aren't completely production-ready – and as a result there is no clear pathway to get started.

We are thinking of listing explicit use cases on our footer, eg. "Launch a DEX"

@Audo I meant I disagreed with the comment that the main problem is we have too many products and need to get them out to people. 
It seems that building a userbase is somewhat beyond Komodo at this point since there are no production ready products yet. 
Need to get back to the foundations and rebuild the team and community.

> I like the name, a gateway to crypto. We are quite hesitant to rename AtomicDEX though. It already got a following and buzz. People are aware of the name.

@Audo 

Let me rephrase, there should be a Komodo Suite that is called a gateway. And contain the products like the dex and the composer, and an appstore.


[15-Sep-20 09:24 AM] Arcodes#0356
Imo we shouldn't target investors and developers as 2 single groups. Because them both need each other. We should tharget em as a group that needs each other


[15-Sep-20 09:28 AM] Arcodes#0356
Same goes for users actually they need the devs and investors to get the product and vice versa


[15-Sep-20 10:22 AM] Audo#5667
yeah, everything compliments each other at the end of the day. AtomicDEX users drive up the value of the DEX network, and that brings in devs, and then those devs develop more products, and those products bring new users in.


[15-Sep-20 10:23 AM] Audo#5667
if we do things right AtomicDEX should also bring a lot of new people into KMD


[15-Sep-20 10:30 AM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
On AtomicDex pro, the header on the left that contains dashboard, wallet, dex, news, Dapps; is this not like the concept of a gateway? Seems all that is missing is  antara composer & easy access to the komodo documents(knowledge base). Dapps could easily be the app store.


[15-Sep-20 10:46 AM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
Let us not forget we are competing for people's attention. Having these types of attention grabbing things built in are necessary to build and keep excitement. Ie: things that give you a dopamine rush, troll chat boxes, air drops, crypto rewards, gaming, etc

@༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻ 

Exactly, everything is already there, the  thing is how to communicate it.  Small things like calling dapps a dApp Store make it comparable to the google play store and apples app store, ofc. It creates the impresdion that this is playing in the same league as pepole would automatically associate dapp store withe the commen known ones. 

And my proposal is kind of comunicate the goal of the roadmap. 

Like: Welcome to Komodo, your gateway to crypto. Use the atomicDex and get your multicoin wallet and exchange account at once. But not only that. You also get accsess to a knowledge and an investment hub or the tools to build your own crypto projects and market them....whatever you're looking for in the crypto space. 
...And if you don't find what you're looking for, drop a request in the chat box.

Something like that and over the years and updates the user interface could shift in the software suite direction, bc some users only need the wallet everything else is to much for them. Girls for instance or old folks.  So if we want to be able to service such users, it is doable by simply adding the ability to switch the possiblities on and off. 
Things will very likely evolve there anyway.

Generally speaking, when It comes to communicating, I'd go for communicating the vision and complement it with the existing tools.


[15-Sep-20 02:52 PM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
So then if we were to add a homepage that communicated the user pathways this would satisfy these requirements. The page would act as the gateway and direct the user towards their passions

For an antara user
```Explicit pathways.

I like the idea of letting people wrap their brand in the tech. Dash would be great community to make a dash skinned theme

```We are thinking of listing explicit use cases on our footer, eg. "Launch a DEX" ```


[15-Sep-20 03:02 PM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
Now so far all we have been talking about is the platform. Kmd the coin hasn't been mentioned. I think it would be great to think of some of the more marketable value propositions kmd has to offer. Ie: something the average user/investor immediately understands as a value proposition. My vote would be to focus on the future coming use cases such as sidechains which will lock coins.

I don't think the naming necessarily has to be descriptive. It just complicates things. Just needs to be simple, somewhat catchy, and easy to remember. Think "Apple" or "Google".


[15-Sep-20 03:20 PM] richardt#2807
Again, going back to the idea of pushing a ready for mass usage product and something people like to use. It shouldn't need much explanation. If it does, then it's likely not good enough or intuitive enough.


[15-Sep-20 04:09 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
Komodo DeFi Wallet- screw  Atomic, nobody knows the brand or what atomic even is....yes shape shift and other wallets use electrumX  wallets just like AtomicDEX... Komodo had a totally different system set up - it was my point in the conception in 2017 - why call them smart addresses? Its a DEV vs Consumer issue.....its a freaking wallet that can do multiple things including using Atomic DEX  trading ....hopefully it will be hooked up to a CEX and other new Defi technologies...
Its a Defi Wallet created by Komodo - SCREW ATOMIC! It has NO Value to consumers nor branding....its just a technology .....

If it is this hard for us to describe what komodo is then I can only imagine what someone who looks in sees. The AtomicDex pro is the main piece trying the platform together. It's modular nature makes it hard to describe. It's not just a dex or a wallet, or dapp store, or Dapps, or chatbox, forums, knowledge base, games, etc. The theme of a starting point/pathways for all this tech seems to be consistent. Maybe the name should represent a theme, something such as coming together, or multiuse, or unity.

@༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻ 

like mentioned above, apple, google, tesla, they are names, and to describe what they do is not easy, they are complex..
now to describe what komodo does, with tech that is innovative and out the box thinking for average people in the world who are oblivious to cryptos and wallets and all that, 
or even to describe it in the crypto space, it allows users to behave in ways which are even out of the box for the current iteration of crypto & utility & behaviour
...personally, i don't think a name needs DEFI in it, but if done right it also could be fine...  similarly, the brand name doesn't need wallet, the description can easily highlight that it functions as a wallet/storage as well...
people will soon learn, these things do take time, and time is slow/tedious

Well they did say that AtomicDex was meant to be a reference client and that more were to come. If someone doesn't like the name or even wants to do a copy with a rebrand then why not. Call it the Dash Dex and reskin it for Dash , it only helps add liquidity.

If we are keeping it simple the brand is komodo platform and atomicDex pro is it's reference client to show off it's technology  and inspire more developers. App store is definitely motivation for developers. I'd buy a trade bot or other extra trade tools, I'm sure others would too, assuming was safe.

_Here are few takeaways I noted down from the conversaiton so far._

**"Should we consider to rename AtomicDEX?"**
 – With AtomicDEX we are referring to the end-user product
 – Should we have the word "wallet" in the name?
 – AtomicDEX is a reference product of Komodo Platform
 – AtomicDEX name could be limiting to what the product could ultimately become
 – AtomicDEX name has already some recognition among the industry (all the news) and strong recognition within the Komodo community
 – The conclusion of our previous #atomicdefi-discussion was not to rename the product for above reasons.
 – On our proposal we decided to keep it as an endorsed product-brand with the same name, so it has its own bucket (Komodo = products for devs, AtomicDEX = end-user product)

**"How can we create stronger user journeys?"**
 – Describing Komodo/AtomicDEX as a gateway to crypto – the user gets all he needs from a wallet to DEX.
 – Idea to build a crypto knowledgebase and learning portal for the new users, and to ease the newcomer journey into crypto
 – Each product-brand has a different audience that requires a different explanation. Splitting atomicdex to be on its own domain allows us to create a strong user journey.

**"Do we need descriptive product-brand names"**?
 – Long descriptive name (e.g. 'Komodo Custom Contracts') vs short, simple and catchy (e.g. one word like 'Komodo Composer')
 – Should a developer facing product-brand be descriptive? If not, what ideas/options do we have?
 – Could we use acronyms for these dev products? Komodo CC, Komodo DE

**"Should AtomicDEX become more than a reference product"**?
 – We have to place our emphasis/focus on either the dev side or to the end-user side
 – Komodo team has concluded we must place more emphasis on the dev side and create a developer community (especially for Komodo DeFi Engine)
 – If we want to place more emphasis/resources into AtomicDEX then could we expand it with optional apps/dapps like troll box?

**"What are our priorities?"**
 – Developer adoption: showcase Komodo DeFi Engine and our reference product AtomicDEX to find developers/businesses who start building DeFi products on Komodo Platform.
 – Tester adoption: appeal to devs/testers and rally our community behind us to polish AtomicDEX products
 – Focus on end-users: create more user-facing features for AtomicDEX and put more resources into UX/UI
 – Focus on community acitvities: create community market making tools that make it easy to become a market maker
 – Other ideas?

If AtomicDEX is referenced as a DEX, then support for trading through hardware wallets is needed. Most DEX allow users to trade using HW wallets, w/o the need to use the app wallet, that's why they are called DEX.
If AtomicDEX is referenced as a wallet, then security audits of the codes by 3rd parties are needed.


[16-Sep-20 01:16 AM] gcharang#6833
@PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator please give me links to all the true dexes that allow trading through hardware wallets


[16-Sep-20 01:17 AM] gcharang#6833
also, hardware wallet support and being a DEX have no relation what so ever


[16-Sep-20 01:36 AM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
yes it does, allow trading through HW wallet means the exchange doesn't have your funds in custody. w/o security audits of AtomicDEX, & if I'm not wrong AtomicDEX android app source codes are not open-sources, who can guarantee that AtomicDEX wallet is safe ? that's why support for HW wallets is needed.
For instance BinanceDEX, KyberSwap, Shapeshift ... support trading through HW wallets, & any erc20 dex that has support for metamask basically supports HW wallets as well.


[16-Sep-20 01:37 AM] gcharang#6833
are you talking specifically about the android app or the whole mm2 and desktop stack?


[16-Sep-20 01:38 AM] gcharang#6833

the app is in beta and in development. if you don't want to use it, please wait till public release. then the code will be open source. there have been private audits done on the code and many public ones can be done once the app is open source


[16-Sep-20 01:43 AM] gcharang#6833
but, I reiterate that hardware wallet support is nice to have, but it isn't necessary for atomicDEX to be a true DEX

BinanceDEX - lol

Shapeshift - is a CEX

all of them support HW wallets because their architecture makes it easy. HW wallet support will come to atomicdex in the future. but, it is not a priority and it isn't necessary for it to be a true dex


[16-Sep-20 01:48 AM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
Last time I used shapeshift was long time ago, didn't know they require kyc now, so I just include it.
I was talking the AtomicDEX app as a whole, I agree that the underlying engine is a true DEX, but with a wallet adding on top of that, it personnally makes me a bit anxious. 
> the app is in beta and in development. if you don't want to use it, please wait till public release. then the code will be open source. there have been private audits done on the code and many public ones can be done once the app is open source

this is understandable. this is the reason, the atomicdex mobile app isn't advertised to the wider public. the only reason the app is available in the app/play stores is for the testing -> feedback -> dev -> release -> testing cycle


[16-Sep-20 02:01 AM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
yes I agree, I didn't mean HW is the only way to prove that your funds are not in custody. It's a nice to have if AtomicDEX could add support for existing wallets like Trust Wallet, just my opinion
Proxy token dex, BEP-2 is a tradeoff, but a must have, Binance is in custody for sure, but it's auditable on chain, & it allow trading on their DEX with lower fee.

[16-Sep-20 02:05 AM] Audo#5667 (pinned)
@Mylo this is the way I understand it, our strategy is either to

a) focus on offering developer tools that allow others to build DEX and other DeFi products -> we highlights AtomicDEX as a _reference product_, which means that we say "we don't inted this to be a perfect product, it's more of a reference applications showcasing our technology. Our goal isn't to become the number 1 crypto wallet, but the most used platform for DEXes and DeFi products."

b) focus on finding a product-market fit and developing an amazing end-user product with all the bells and whissles and amazing UX&UI. 

I don't think we have the resources to do both, and that is why I am stressing that currently we are positioning AtomicDEX as a "reference product"

Another option could be to release a srparate app and call that a wallet. Slight design changes no charts no otderbook. A lite version of the dex. And brand them both as "Atomic Dex by Komodo" and "Atomic Wallet by Komodo" basically establish a product line instead of a single product.

@Audo 

A possibility would be to build product subgroups and name them  "by Komodo" just in the logo. This kind of gives everything a designer touch. And each prroduct line, the dev line, the enduser line, the investor line could have their own brands.


[16-Sep-20 03:37 AM] Audo#5667
We are thinking of including "by Komodo" for AtomicDEX brand. I had used the monolistic branding structure with the dev prodcuts underneath the Komodo P latform (komodoplatform.com). Let me share a a quick overview we made as we tried to understand how this direction would affect our website NAV structure.

The idea was that the visitor hovers over the "solutions" and sees that info. For example:

 - hover over "Komodo Custom Contracts" --> Komodo Oracle solution highlighted (as a reference module/implementation about what can be built)

End user thinks "Its a wallet with some swapping options"  
"SwapWallet" works for grandma - atomic reminds her of Hiroshima  - description can follow the brand - P2P Decentralized Exchange using Komodos Atomic Swap technology.
Even if its not a "wallet" ....it still looks like one...
And adding a CEX option isn't the end of the world ...
Find me some DEVs and I'll build an end user product or several products including dexP2P to file/video sharing app.... content providers would love to be paid directly in zFUNDs..

Creating snippets of code and  naming it with a brand  and expecting DEVs to come join the community is pretty far fetched....

Don't brand it if you are not going to finish it....and don't brand code at the beginning  of a project - we all know things evolve and now you think you are stuck with the word atomic.... when in actuality not even .00001% of the world's population ever heard of it....

Komodo P2P exchange technology is the DEV description 

AtomicDEX - is a sample use case 

Don't even try to create new brand names if you are not focused on end user products.

Creating consumer products is my Forte.

Another suggestion I have that would be easy enough to do is to make a very open announcement about who is on which team and what are their roles. So many people have come and left over the years, no one can keep up anymore. This will help rebuild some confidence in the team/project, which is lacking quite a bit at the moment.

Hey @༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻, thanks for asking! Here are my thoughts about the name AtomicDEX
 
- you find us with "atomicdex" search, all results are about us
- it has a strong recognition without the KMD community
- it has somewhat good recognition within our industry
- the name is mentioned in many articles we have appeared on
- it does have a reference to atomic swaps & DEX, which doesn't hurt
--> renaming would just create more work and bring us back to the square one.

I am not completely against renaming it, but it also sounded like our community didn't want a rename. That combined with the reasons above makes the case for keeping it as AtoimcDEX a strong one. If we would rename it I feel the name should be something easily approachable, easy to pronounce, unique, and easy to remember (it's an end-user product).


[16-Sep-20 10:48 PM] Audo#5667

We went back to the drawing table and had long conversations with our dev team, and as the result we ended up with three developer facing product offerings outlined on the proposal. All directly branded under 'Komodo Platform' with the "master brand hierarchy" principle.

There's something coming called PyCC, that lets devs to code modules in Python language. It's indeed quite hard to develop new modules currently, and that has been the greatest bottleneck for Komodo Platform adoption.

Just read all your comments and here is mine: 

It's simple: centralize marketing and decision making. And drop the name "komodo". 

The more ideas you allow to be considered the less chance for consensus. Everyone believes in his own idea which holds them back pushing other ideas forward. 

Involve a single marketer and stand behind him/her.


[17-Sep-20 01:23 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
Swap data and any other data you would want scrambled across a DEXP2P network  and you could rent out your partition ...and movies for coin and maybe some OnlyFans type things....all this can be done  when CEX liquid is plugged in ....the bottleneck in all DEX projects is LPs....I can't finish VaraPay until consistent swaps can be made....P2P LPs would jump in when the system is being used.....not until then will the p2p exchange be used by the masses..... 
Liquid is the next step.. Binance APIs will solve the problem

Hi guys. Sorry have no time to read all posts here. I’m sure we need an official classic forum where we can chat and the main thing buy/sell and offer services for kmd. Place where user can have reputation and reviews. Current komodo portal and discord are not suitable for this.

I think that a clear and concise history of the project, from its beginnings in bitcoin dark / supernet and even whatever was before that. I think members of the community would love to have a better understanding of the past. And transition such a page to a future road map. The better the community understands the projects past, present, and future roadmap. We could be better salesman for the project than simply hodlers. I’ve been involved in the crypto space since 2011, and Komodo is ideologically is  where I fit in the entire crypto space, examples being uses the security of btc with dpow (huge selling point), open to collaboration with other projects, and most importantly Open-sourced. But even as long as I’ve been involved in the space the complexity of the entire kmd platform can be a bit much and I’m not even sure I entirely grasp every aspect completely. So finding better orators within the community would be a giant plus if we had a better references and better understanding of the project as a whole, past, and future road map. Perhaps a interview going through the history of the platform could accompany such a resource page. I think we have people in the community just itching to contribute in any way we can.


[18-Sep-20 03:25 PM] WnyCrypto#8781
I think if more funds need to be allocated to complete the dex or speed the process along however that may be, organize a community fund or hold a money-bomb style online event where we interview people in the crypto-space, community members, and developers. Once the AtomicDEX is completed I’ll shouting about kmd and atomic swaps all day. But getting out of beta is huge.


[18-Sep-20 08:02 PM] WnyCrypto#8781
Also the peer to peer aspect of the dex needs to be emphasized! Especially once it is out of beta. This reminds me of my very first large scale peer to peer use-case via p2p file sharing sites in the early 2000s. For old timers like me the nostalgia of such a time that was pushing so many boundaries, not just technologically, but also culturally. I think that same opportunity resides here as the team push the technological boundaries for the AtomicDEX and the Komodo platform as a whole. With the tech and presentation, in comes the liquidity, in comes pushing the cultural boundaries via true peer to peer cross chain atomic swaps.


[18-Sep-20 08:37 PM] WnyCrypto#8781
Good resources on how to mine kmd would also fit into such marketing. Making it as easy as possible for new miners. Like I’ve been personally thinking of buying a z15 but I have no idea how, because I have never personally mined any crypto currency.  Having a tutorial and good resources for new miners could only help the project! The more open and welcoming the community is in every aspect the better. We need to be opening doors and helping others get involved by making things as simple to understand as possible.

I think kmd should focus all there energy on one max two things that  generate revenue and be laser focused on that particular things. In my mind it should be adex. We need more income for devs and marketing.i don't think it's a good idea to to spit up our focus on explaining the million different things komodo can do. That can come later them there is income to pay for devs. In branding architecture for the public view there should only be revenue generated products and max two. Like adax and dpow everything else should be add later. (but what about my innovations) you don't innovative on a emty stomach. Keep it simple. we need revenue

@hastrup Agreed. That's something I've said for a long awhile now. Komodo tries to be too many things when funding and dev resources are lacking. Many people have come and leave without really finishing anything. Adex is definitely the most promising out of all things atm.


[19-Sep-20 08:01 AM] phm87#7395
adex and dpow I think


[19-Sep-20 08:02 AM] richardt#2807
Imagine where the project would be if everyone had just been laser focused on Adex from the very beginning


[19-Sep-20 08:04 AM] richardt#2807
Dpow is ok. Won't be much demand/interest in that unless Komodo becomes more trusted and with significant market share


[19-Sep-20 08:26 AM] hastrup#8742
If adex succeed dpow will also get wide adoptions. But again when the budget is not limiteless like other projects seems to have. we need to go all in on the featur that we are have the best chance to give revenue

We need the prices on the adex to be more competitive, so I agree liquidity is needed. also limit sells that move with market conditions would be a huge plus. A feature that would keep an order at a specific dex/cex %  that moves with market conditions. That’s a big reason I don’t flood the adex with my personal liquidity. I don’t have the time to keep manually adjusting the rates.

Sounds similar to what I was thinking about. Lock kmd for kUSD @ 200-500% collateral, then use the extra active user rewards to pay the rewards and provide additional kmd liquidity in dex :abusedsmily:

I would provide liquidity to atomicdex but only if I end up gaining kmd and not other tokens

@Crabby Paddy No! you will get some other tokens

@Crabby Paddy that could be used for certain things, like free trading maybe 😉

[20-Sep-20 03:31 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
that is what ShapeShift exchage does LOL - they even get people started with 1,000 native tokens every month for free trades


[20-Sep-20 03:31 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I mean hypothetically, if you lock up $100,000 worth of kmd for $20,000 kUSD


[20-Sep-20 03:31 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
To stake for more kUSD (defi things)


[20-Sep-20 03:31 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
The 100,000 should be generating $20,000 kmd a year


[20-Sep-20 03:32 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
NO!


[20-Sep-20 03:32 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
But the $20,000 kUSD if it was capped at 5% paid out in the stablecoin (how people like it)


[20-Sep-20 03:32 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
not in komodo, but a new / another based komodo synthetic token


[20-Sep-20 03:32 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Then there’s additional revenue to kmd, as long as the balance is maintained 😮


[20-Sep-20 03:33 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Since it does not change the 5.1% active user reward, except the smart contract / kmd is claiming that and paying out 5% on a 1/5 value and keeping the 4/5 for use or selling or providing liquidity on dex


[20-Sep-20 03:34 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
the active user reward currenlty is for 30 days I believe, to encourage new users and wallet downloads


[20-Sep-20 03:34 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
a smart contract, can lock KMD sure, but any rewards must be PAID out as a new native token ...


[20-Sep-20 03:35 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
otherwise you need to maintain bespoke treasury pools and l2, and I come from finance , that is even challenge for a big shoppes like BlackRock Asset Management


[20-Sep-20 03:35 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
and they manage 11 trillion in AUM


[20-Sep-20 03:40 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Claimed every 30 days but resets and goes on until some time in the future (10 years or something I believe)

In my scenario say kmd is $1
If we do what factom is doing and lock in $100,000 / 100,000kmd to redeem $20,000 kUSD (5x collateral) 

The person locking it can get a guaranteed 5% a year, paid in a stablecoin. Which if kmd maintains a stable value, would be 1000kmd/1000kUSD

The contract holder / smart contract / team generates 5000kmd from the 100,000kmd locked up, so there’s an excess of 4000kmd after paying the interest. 

The 4000kmd can be tokenised and sold off for USDT or kUSD or any stablecoin, which is then used to pay the person locking up tokens, and the sale of the kmd can be done on atomicdex, which would provide much more liquidity with Kmd-> other pairs and people running marketmakers


[20-Sep-20 03:40 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
That’s how I see it anyway, I have 0 financial experience


[20-Sep-20 03:40 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
So I could be 200% wrong :abusedsmily:


[20-Sep-20 03:41 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
But id like to be able to do something with my kmd or have the ability to lock it up eventually :KMD:


[20-Sep-20 03:43 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
everything you say is right, but you cannot issue a new monetary value against 'STAKING'


[20-Sep-20 03:44 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
but a synethic token, its (1) too much work, and (2) corp mechanics are too complicated


[20-Sep-20 03:45 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
You distribute it to large whales, initially (even insiders) and like Cronje says, to user wallets later


[20-Sep-20 03:45 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
*weekly basis etc


[20-Sep-20 03:46 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
but unlike the original KMD ICO, the new synthetic token is distibuted only to those that are locking their KMD to staking, period smart contracts 😄


[20-Sep-20 03:48 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
IOHO 😄


[20-Sep-20 03:50 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
The 5% APR is an *Activity Reward*. If coins are locked into a contract, they're not active on the Komodo network, so I see no problem these funds not claiming any rewards on a monthly basis, unless the owner pulls them out of the contract every month and enters a new contract.


[20-Sep-20 03:52 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
That is already been decided by the team tho 😭 you cant just make changes

The only way around it, is to create a contract that that allows the locked coins to be sent to its own address on set periods... You just need to code that into the contract: Code is Law...

1 month lock up periods then, so when people withdraw with interest it creates the reward from the tx :abusedsmily:

It is better that a synthetic token (staking reward) is used to claim rewards like free trading


[20-Sep-20 03:59 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
Cope the existing business es - shapeshift is doing it already on Eth, and you reward staking directly via time period smart contracts


[20-Sep-20 03:59 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
More desirable for speculators: yes. Better: that remains to be seen.


[20-Sep-20 03:59 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
Plus speculation 😭💚📈💜🌟


[20-Sep-20 03:59 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
Its 99.99% easier to execute ;)


[20-Sep-20 04:00 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
I am building a token , it's harder than it looks 🥺🧐

> reward staking directly via time period smart contracts
That would defeat the purpose of these rewards: keep users involved in KMD, for which they are rewarded.
This solution incentivezes parking your coins, forgetting about them and sending Komodo into oblivion...


[20-Sep-20 04:02 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
You get rewards , that is the whole point


[20-Sep-20 04:02 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Imo if something similar was made


[20-Sep-20 04:02 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I’m sure the amount of active users


[20-Sep-20 04:02 AM] Komodefi#5638
all I see is file cabinets filling up with govt compliance paperwork. does eth get a free pass on aml or something?


[20-Sep-20 04:02 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
And community would grow wildly


[20-Sep-20 04:02 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
And make up for that


[20-Sep-20 04:02 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
The point is not getting rewards, the point is keeping users connected to Komodo


[20-Sep-20 04:02 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
Easier said than done, you are delsign eith ETH and BTC maxipads


[20-Sep-20 04:02 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Make the most of the hype, get more community and exposure, which will long term lead to more users connected to Komodo


[20-Sep-20 04:03 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
In order to do that, these rewards have been invented.


[20-Sep-20 04:03 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
They control the narrative - you need a new token - besides KMD to encourage users to jump to DEX


[20-Sep-20 04:04 AM] Komodefi#5638
20% rewards is a pyramid scheme


[20-Sep-20 04:04 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
If I give you some free KMD tokens, right now you would lose your mind :D


[20-Sep-20 04:04 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
Even as airdrop initially Stellar did that too !


[20-Sep-20 04:06 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
That is what KMD 1 month reward is essentially

eth wrapped token swappable 1:1 kmd on atomic dex has been discussed


[20-Sep-20 04:07 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
No need to continue that into infinity


[20-Sep-20 04:07 AM] Komodefi#5638
5% ends in 8yrs or something

@Komodefi yes you need a BRIDGE TO UniSwap that is separate


[20-Sep-20 04:08 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
Better to do it on Tron tho, the are much cheaper esp for small transactions


[20-Sep-20 04:09 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
Both! 😅


[20-Sep-20 04:09 AM] Komodefi#5638
it's an open project. if you wanna try it... time is money.


[20-Sep-20 04:10 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
We are doing cryptokenbaordapp rn 🎾📈💜🌟


[20-Sep-20 04:10 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
But adding code developers - for diff strategies is a new competitive field - curve defi had that new UNI token


[20-Sep-20 04:11 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
So people would code smart cotnacts and encourage more trading , more fees LOL


[20-Sep-20 04:11 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
Greedy people Cronje is addicted now LOL


[20-Sep-20 04:11 AM] Komodefi#5638
does tron use solidity?


[20-Sep-20 04:12 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
They are a carbon copy of Ethereum,  but broke up gas fees into 2 categories - 'energy' and 'bandwidth' instead of just gas GWEI


[20-Sep-20 04:13 AM] Komodefi#5638
oh i see. makes sense


[20-Sep-20 04:13 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
And offer free transaction if you freeze some Trx in their wallet


[20-Sep-20 04:14 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
JUST (tron) is the same thing as MAKER (ethereum)


[20-Sep-20 04:14 AM] Komodefi#5638
the dude is gonna use every syllable of his name, nice


[20-Sep-20 04:15 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
Bahahha


[20-Sep-20 04:15 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
😅🥺😭😭


[20-Sep-20 04:17 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
But ...


[20-Sep-20 04:17 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
Tron already has 5 billion in wrapped BTC,  via TRC20 soooo


[20-Sep-20 04:17 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
There goes all the LIQ you would ever need :D


[20-Sep-20 04:18 AM] Komodefi#5638
raising awareness of the power of programmable money is great for crypto.


[20-Sep-20 04:19 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
And already have PoS mining grids (private) so they already converted, eth is still old LOL


[20-Sep-20 04:20 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
> raising awareness of the power of programmable money is great for crypto.
@Komodefi you cant rush a blockchain


[20-Sep-20 04:20 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
But KMD has a great chance , since it has built in token ecosystem and interoperability


[20-Sep-20 04:21 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
Why is Polkadot 4 billion market cap


[20-Sep-20 04:22 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
They did a 100:1 split something stady


[20-Sep-20 04:22 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
Blockchain needs clients not VC money LOL


[20-Sep-20 04:23 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
BSV has 5,000 internal projects but 0 outside clients LOL


[20-Sep-20 04:23 AM] Komodefi#5638
It's not really a winner take all game. competent devs are not easy to find


[20-Sep-20 04:24 AM] Komodefi#5638
I think a lot of guys are working across projects


[20-Sep-20 04:25 AM] Komodefi#5638
I've talked to a couple projects who said they hire out all of their blockchain dev work.


[20-Sep-20 04:26 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
not Komodo - you guys are a close nit group


[20-Sep-20 04:26 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
which is why it is going to work :0


[20-Sep-20 04:26 AM] Komodefi#5638
you have a few hundred million in eth go poof with a bad commit


[20-Sep-20 04:27 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
All of Curve Finance trading strategies are vulnerable, Cronje says it himself


[20-Sep-20 04:28 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
Once you build your businss model on fees, its gets out of hand quickly


[20-Sep-20 04:28 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
That is why every token, needs to have utility, (and not governance that is fake news) LOL


[20-Sep-20 04:31 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
And good price / yeild / apr / allocation Oracles, that is yearn finance advatage

We have had this 'brand architecture' discussion for some time now, and it seems we are going in the right direction. Earlier, we made a quick pool, and these were the results:

 - 26 voted that "Yes, we are definitely on the right track."
 - 4 voted that "Maybe, but we should spend more time thinking about alternative options."
 - 1 voted that "No, the changes won't bring clarity or benefits."

We are pretty happy about this, and we also feel we are on the right track. We also synced up with our PR agency, and they also thought this is the right direction.

Still, we are far from finished. We have to map out all the puzzle pieces and form a vision about the overall structure. 
 – How do we effectively tell our story and explain what a developer can do on the Komodo Platform? 
 – How can we explain our vision and mission to onboard new members into our community?
 – How can we showcase our activity and put our community into the front page?

We will open up the discussion again once we have actual content, such as wireframes, etc. to show.

After we have everything mapped out and we are happy about it, the actual implementation can begin.
