./makeprices to create the .so for prices dapp
cc/games/prices starts a very simple game, it isnt complete yet, but I thought I would explain what it is about
there is a reference node based on -ac_pubkey which is posting special reference tx with the price of BTC/USD by using the dapp
all other nodes also run the dapp and you can change the betsize with ^ or /, and change the price premium with + or -


[27-Mar-19 11:40 PM] jl777c#5810
every 10 seconds your node will make a bet of betsize with the adjusted BTC/USD price


[27-Mar-19 11:41 PM] jl777c#5810
these bets will then be compared to a future blocks reference prices to determine the winner(s). for now i set it to 3 blocks gap, so if you can predict BTC/USD prices half hour ahead, you will win more often than not


[27-Mar-19 11:43 PM] jl777c#5810
just a simple example of bet (lock) and settle based on external data, though i still need to get the settle part working


[27-Mar-19 11:44 PM] jl777c#5810
while it is in games CC and thus supports the rogue game rpc calls, most of them dont really apply, as this is an always running game

So binary options in the blockchain is born?


[28-Mar-19 02:56 AM] jl777c#5810
it is more a contest among all participants to see who is the most accurate (without going all crazy with protections against miners cheating and having a trusted reference price source). Still not sure how to determine payouts. I have a block full of predictions.


[28-Mar-19 02:56 AM] jl777c#5810
I am wondering if to aggregate by pubkey and choose the pubkey with the most accurate prediction, or just find the single bet that was most accurate


[28-Mar-19 02:57 AM] jl777c#5810
there will be many reference points, so maybe the closest to each one wins...


[28-Mar-19 02:59 AM] jl777c#5810
many ways to do this and it is just a proof of concept, so I think I will just do a simple aggregation of the reference and then find the closest to make a winner take all for that block. the way the dapp works is that you are making a new bet every 10 seconds, so it shouldnt be a disaster even if you dont win in a specific block


[28-Mar-19 10:14 AM] TonyL#3577

there was a bug in determining if a price was within tolerance


[29-Mar-19 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
with all the cryptos, there are now occasional >1% changes


[29-Mar-19 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
a few other edge cases too, so now just need to see what happens with a 1% clamped block when the real price is beyond the 1%. online nodes should accept it, worst case if they reject it, they should get stuck for a bit and then rejoin the main chain when a new block arrives


[29-Mar-19 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
if there is no valid miner making good blocks, the chain will stall. that is the one different with the trustless oracle. if things are not right, it will just stop


[29-Mar-19 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
now that the raw prices are coming in, the next layer is adding consensus prices based on the raw prices. due to the required delay for using the prices for settlement of money results, I plan to use the prior days blocks to generate the consensus price. Once we have that, it should be slower to adjust, but could be relied upon to be non-manipulated


[29-Mar-19 12:14 PM] jl777c#5810
however, the nature of removing any manipulation requires a majority consensus (within an epsilon factor) starting from a deterministic random starting point in a rotating buffer. so as you can see, the price output wont be very smooth at all


[29-Mar-19 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
so I think we will need a third layer of smoothed consensus prices, which can finally be used for settlements block by block. it should behave as approx a daily SMA


[29-Mar-19 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
which means when making a bet the context is the current price, the prior days smoothed price, so there will be a fair amount of inertia to the price. I guess having something that displays the prices would be very good to have

only one node missed one price change during todays giant revaluation across the board. it is a very rare case, but it got hit and pretty sure I can make it better. just restarting made it sync up though, so i think it isnt so bad as it is, but might as well make it handle even very volatile conditions. after that I  think it is open for price attack testing. the code should just make any node that mines invalid prices to go off on its own fork, so as long as there is one honest miner, the chain will continue to advance. that is the theory

@gcharang ok, it is syncing to existing chain from scratch now (with the 3 restarts). still working on rpc calls,but the next level consensus code is active. I havent verified it stays in sync yet, so still experimental status. there is even a prices rpc call that returns most recent prices, but the prices logic is still being worked on for the second two prices of each block


[02-Apr-19 08:03 AM] gcharang#6833
thank you, will keep that in mind while experimenting

[02-Apr-19 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
would be cool to see a chart with all three overlaid each other, and maybe even the actual realtime price too

Oh right, there is no `prices` method in cclib. But crash is not gentle way to say about it aha :)
Got the samples. Is samples amount depth some fixed number and it will shift or it will just stack each other until inifinity?

http://159.69.45.70:8050/ made super basic POC. It grabbing one price data only (from 3) and with fixed depth.
Have an other widescale and urgent task ongoing atm. Will polish this oracle visualisation server asap


[03-Apr-19 02:58 AM] jl777c#5810
ok. no rush. I synced FSM branch with current jl777, about to make changes for new coinbase format that will break existing ac_cbopret chains


[03-Apr-19 02:58 AM] jl777c#5810
now the prices layer seems reasonably stable, i will start on the next step. but the prices dapp is still not in the next cycle as I need a bit more infrastructure in place


[03-Apr-19 03:00 AM] jl777c#5810
which of the three prices is that site showing?


[03-Apr-19 03:00 AM] TonyL#3577
Great! These data viz frameworks are very user-friendly so took only 1 hour for some working example. I think if work on it few days - it's possible to make very cool interactive web-plots

I think I made it static for now (list loading once when I'm starting the server)

At the moment I'm making CSV from prices output and displaying it from this file - will make a simple script now which refreshing this CSV each minute let's say so will be possible to get more actual data on page refresh

👌 

[03-Apr-19 04:10 AM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain the problem is that the trustless oracles allow anybody to mine a block and as long as it is within 1% of previous block and a nodes local data, it is accepted


[03-Apr-19 04:10 AM] jl777c#5810
still it is possible for a miner to consistently bias the price by up to 1%, maybe a bit more


[03-Apr-19 04:10 AM] jl777c#5810
and if we are allowing leverage even a 0.5% biasing of price will skew the results of a 100x leveraged bet


[03-Apr-19 04:11 AM] jl777c#5810
so....


[03-Apr-19 04:11 AM] jl777c#5810
we need to randomize the price that is actually used. while the blue line by miners looks actually quite good, there were no attackers during this period


[03-Apr-19 04:13 AM] jl777c#5810
the algo is to use a deterministic random starting point within the past day. starting from that point if there are 51% of the prior days prices that are within 3% of the starting price, the correlated price is the starting price. I tried to smooth the correlated data but as we can see from the orange it isnt very smooth at all. and the green data is not any better, so I need to restart from the very raw data and see what it looks like. that is what the current version does


[03-Apr-19 04:14 AM] jl777c#5810
I am hoping the orange becomes a lot more randomized, but the green to be somewhat smoothed


[03-Apr-19 04:15 AM] jl777c#5810
though thinking about it, the orange is actually not so bad considering the constraints it is under

I just caught an edge case  of an edge case that really only can happen if right during initial sync, you end up missing a price move. since you just started, there is no history to compare recent volatility. it detected this and refused to accept the block. then a few minutes later it was able to see a price that is close to what it rejected and it changed its mind. previously rejected is now accepted and it reached sync


[12-Apr-19 04:29 AM] jl777c#5810
to make this more of an edge case, that node was a mining node and it has gone on its own fork


[12-Apr-19 04:30 AM] jl777c#5810
it is actually 1 block ahead. but it lost all its peers


[12-Apr-19 04:44 AM] jl777c#5810
but now the chain is on some small forks, it should resolve when the nodes propagate the blocks. investigating

👌 

[12-Apr-19 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
added some edge case handling code, the chain is back to being in sync mining on 7 nodes on a 10 node network now


[12-Apr-19 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
also added -ac_stocks= to the commandline that allows to add any stock supported by iex https://api.iextrading.com/1.0/tops/last?symbols=SNAP,fb,AIG
it is quite a large list, seems basically any major stock will be supported.


[13-Apr-19 03:30 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
which branch should I compile to test price CC ?


[13-Apr-19 03:31 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
also, has anybody tested it on mac?


[13-Apr-19 03:33 AM] jl777c#5810
jl777 branch


[13-Apr-19 03:33 AM] jl777c#5810
though FSM is pretty recent and should work too

I still think it will fail


[13-Apr-19 03:35 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
will build it on Linux vm too


[13-Apr-19 03:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

how did it fail, i was able to build on osx


[13-Apr-19 03:57 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
may be then I missed a step in between 🤔 
do I need to execute anything before `./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)` ?

not sure it matches the gcc version


[13-Apr-19 07:10 AM] siu#3920
@jl777c so prices is a whole chain in itself? Meaning,  there could be specific data feed chains instead of specific data oracles wkthin a xhain?


[13-Apr-19 07:12 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, it goes into the coinbase opreturn


[13-Apr-19 07:13 AM] jl777c#5810
so you could make a cluster of price chains and cover thousands of pricefeeds and then use SPV servers to get the data

Opened bigger position (as `./komodo-cli -ac_name=REKT0 pricesbet 1000000000 100 "BTC_USD, 1"` - so amount is definetly in satoshies atm) :

```
Still `costbasis` is 0 and I can't see the price on which I'll rekt. But from good news - `firstprice` moved


[18-Apr-19 12:26 PM] jl777c#5810
of positionsize is the initial bet!


[18-Apr-19 12:26 PM] jl777c#5810
the profits is due to the leverage


[18-Apr-19 12:26 PM] jl777c#5810
and the costbasis is broken. it should never be 0, it should be the maxprice of first 24hrs


[18-Apr-19 12:27 PM] TonyL#3577
`  "profits": 10.00000000,` - not sure why it's same as positionsize, maybe just not counting at all atm 😃


[18-Apr-19 12:28 PM] TonyL#3577
`of positionsize is the initial bet!` position size is initial bet + all pricesaddfunding as I understand


[18-Apr-19 12:29 PM] TonyL#3577
`"addedbets": 0.00000000, `  is sum of all `pricesaddfunding`


[18-Apr-19 12:29 PM] jl777c#5810
no


[18-Apr-19 12:29 PM] jl777c#5810
initial bet determines the position size


[18-Apr-19 12:29 PM] jl777c#5810
the costbasis should be the 5248.68830000 not 0


[18-Apr-19 12:30 PM] jl777c#5810
it basically says that if BTC was 0 when you bought it and you bet 10, you have profits of 10


[18-Apr-19 12:30 PM] TonyL#3577
Ah, so added funding just should change my leverage


[18-Apr-19 12:30 PM] TonyL#3577
Same as on bitmex


[18-Apr-19 12:30 PM] jl777c#5810
but even that is wrong as you have 100x leverage, so you should be up 1000 if cost was 0


[18-Apr-19 12:30 PM] jl777c#5810
added funding gives you more protection from being rekt


[18-Apr-19 12:31 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, my rektprice is moving by morefunding and leverage actually decreasing


[18-Apr-19 12:31 PM] jl777c#5810
with 100x leverage a 1% drop will wipeout the bet


[18-Apr-19 12:31 PM] TonyL#3577
Yup


[18-Apr-19 12:31 PM] jl777c#5810
but the leverage is fixed


[18-Apr-19 12:32 PM] jl777c#5810
the total amount just prevents you from being rekt


[18-Apr-19 12:32 PM] jl777c#5810
if there is enough


[18-Apr-19 12:32 PM] jl777c#5810
so if the price goes down by 0.9%, then you have a loss of 9


[18-Apr-19 12:32 PM] jl777c#5810
0.1% more and you are rekt (maybe we put a bit of cushion there so 0.05% more and you are rekt)


[18-Apr-19 12:33 PM] jl777c#5810
but if you add another 10, then you can avoid being rekt for another 1% drop


[18-Apr-19 12:34 PM] jl777c#5810
so the bugs so far are costbasis is 0, leverage not used when calculating profits, bet amount is in satoshis instead of coins


[18-Apr-19 12:36 PM] TonyL#3577
Yup


[18-Apr-19 12:39 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm are `leverage 0` and `leverage 1` should be something different? 
Other words: am I understan correct that with leverage 0 I should be able to open position without leverage and 1 is leverage which doubling my bet?


[18-Apr-19 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
no


[18-Apr-19 12:40 PM] TonyL#3577
Just thought that leverage starts to count from `2` but was able to open position with `0` leverage so confused


[18-Apr-19 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
leverage 0 should not be allowed

Aha, so one more


[18-Apr-19 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
the profit formula is leverage * profit


[18-Apr-19 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
so if leverage is 0 you wont ever have profits


[18-Apr-19 12:41 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, 1 should be without leverage and from 2 starting leverage, thats what I thought


[18-Apr-19 12:41 PM] jl777c#5810
profit calc is based on percentage difference between current price and costbasis


[18-Apr-19 12:44 PM] TonyL#3577
Updated list :)
so the bugs so far are: `costbasis is 0, leverage not used when calculating profits, bet amount is in satoshis instead of coins, possible to create position with 0 leverage`


[18-Apr-19 12:44 PM] TonyL#3577
Ah, and current price not displaying


[18-Apr-19 12:45 PM] dimxy#2587
there is a check for leverage in the code, mayb it does nt cover 0


[18-Apr-19 12:47 PM] dimxy#2587
about costbasis 
my understanding was that we can set costbasis after 24h when smoothed value might be calculated
was not sure what to set  to it before 24h
plus I now do not allow set costbasis before 24h pased from the bet height


[18-Apr-19 12:47 PM] jl777c#5810
not the permanent costbasis, but the temporary one


[18-Apr-19 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
we need to be able to see the profit calculations before 24hrs


[18-Apr-19 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
so the costbasis is always updated each block,until it is made permanent with a costbasis tx


[18-Apr-19 12:49 PM] dimxy#2587
probably we need to output that its permanent or not?


[18-Apr-19 12:54 PM] jl777c#5810
yes


[18-Apr-19 12:54 PM] jl777c#5810
can list the costbasis txid if it has one


[18-Apr-19 12:54 PM] jl777c#5810
so if it doesnt, then it is temp

{Reactions}
👌 

[18-Apr-19 12:54 PM] jl777c#5810
i think it will be exciting to see the profit calc change each block

[18-Apr-19 12:55 PM] dimxy#2587
about value formatting: 
we usually output coins in coins and tokens in satoshis. Here we re working with coins, maybe thats why satoshi were converted to coins?


[18-Apr-19 12:56 PM] jl777c#5810
the number was not converted to coins


[18-Apr-19 12:56 PM] jl777c#5810
100 bet became 0.00000010


[18-Apr-19 12:56 PM] jl777c#5810
instead of 100.0


[18-Apr-19 12:56 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, and we also need to add betting with tokens


[18-Apr-19 12:56 PM] TonyL#3577
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=REKT0 pricesbet 1000000000 100 "BTC_USD, 1"```
creating position with `  "positionsize": 10.00000000,`


[18-Apr-19 12:57 PM] jl777c#5810
so an optional parameter or different rpc for token betting


[18-Apr-19 12:57 PM] jl777c#5810
./komodo-cli -ac_name=REKT0 pricesbet 1000000000 100 "BTC_USD, 1" <tokenid>


[18-Apr-19 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
that would bet a billion tokens


[18-Apr-19 12:59 PM] dimxy#2587
so probably better to accept  amount as coins not satoshis (for coins case)?


[18-Apr-19 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
for coins in floating point, for tokens in satoshis


[18-Apr-19 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
i think that makes sense


[18-Apr-19 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
using one or two rpc calls


[18-Apr-19 01:49 PM] dimxy#2587
seems leverage  always deserialized as 0 from opreturn
no, it's deserialized okay


[18-Apr-19 03:24 PM] dimxy#2587
I changed profits calculations to double arithmetic. The existed variant caused overflow and loss of value.
updated the code in my repo

@dimxy, for display doubles is fine, but in consensus code it is non-deterministic so uint64_t will need to be used


[18-Apr-19 11:03 PM] jl777c#5810
what part of the equation overflowed and what is the current price that leads to profits of 100? that is 100% profit


[18-Apr-19 11:03 PM] jl777c#5810
did you not subtract 1 from the currentprice/costbasis ?


[18-Apr-19 11:05 PM] dimxy#2587
this expression seems overflows when price=526272990000
((price * SATOSHIDEN) / costbasis) - SATOSHIDEN


[18-Apr-19 11:06 PM] dimxy#2587
for the second, actually now it calculates not profits/loss but closing price:
 return(positionsize + addedbets + profits);


[18-Apr-19 11:07 PM] dimxy#2587
we might return just profits instead


[18-Apr-19 11:08 PM] jl777c#5810
"profits" should be just the profits


[18-Apr-19 11:08 PM] jl777c#5810
return(positionsize + addedbets + profits);
that would be "equity"


[18-Apr-19 11:08 PM] jl777c#5810
and the current price needs to be in the JSON


[18-Apr-19 11:11 PM] jl777c#5810
((price * SATOSHIDEN) / costbasis) - SATOSHIDEN ->

(((price/10000) * SATOSHIDEN) / (costbasis/10000)) - SATOSHIDEN


[18-Apr-19 11:11 PM] jl777c#5810
and actually instead of using 10000, use komodo_pricemult(ind)

{Reactions}
👍 

[18-Apr-19 11:12 PM] jl777c#5810
the komodo_pricemult() is what to multiply the 32bit price to an 8 decimals satoshis based number

{Reactions}
👌 

[18-Apr-19 11:13 PM] jl777c#5810
for BTC/USD it only has 4 decimals precision, so it is multiplied by 10000


[18-Apr-19 11:13 PM] jl777c#5810
for crypto prices it is already at 8 decimals precision, so multiplied by 1


[18-Apr-19 11:13 PM] jl777c#5810
for forex currencies it is in 2 decimals, so multiplied by 1000000


[18-Apr-19 11:14 PM] jl777c#5810
by reversing this scaling, it should always end up with something that fits in a uint32_t and that wont ever overflow


[18-Apr-19 11:14 PM] jl777c#5810
i think around 4000.0000 it overflows the 64 bits when multiplied by 100 mil


[18-Apr-19 11:17 PM] dimxy#2587
yes 526272990000* 100,000,000 =  52 604 650 000 000 000 000   
and max int64                                           =         9 223 372 036 854 770 000


[18-Apr-19 11:17 PM] jl777c#5810
by dividing by 10000 we should be good for at least a few years before BTC price overflow


[18-Apr-19 11:18 PM] dimxy#2587
ok


[18-Apr-19 11:20 PM] dimxy#2587
Another issue might be with temp costbasis value:
actually how I calculate it now, it appears equal to firstprice value


[18-Apr-19 11:26 PM] jl777c#5810
for long position, maximum price since the position was opened


[18-Apr-19 11:26 PM] jl777c#5810
for short position, minimum price

{Reactions}
👌 

[18-Apr-19 11:30 PM] jl777c#5810
if the price is continuing to go up, the the costbasis will be too and the profit is 0. this prevents using future knowlege of the 24 hr delay to gain instant profit


[18-Apr-19 11:34 PM] dimxy#2587
yes seems now I got this:
while we do not reach 24h for the proper costbasis calculation we should use max/min just for the available period < 24h


[18-Apr-19 11:35 PM] jl777c#5810
yes and the real cost basis is the last value at DAYWINDOW after the position is opened


[18-Apr-19 11:36 PM] jl777c#5810
regardless of when the costbasis tx is issued. so once it is DAYWINDOW, then the cost basis doesnt change


[18-Apr-19 11:36 PM] jl777c#5810
but still during the first day, high leverage positions are watched very carefully and maybe more funds added


[18-Apr-19 11:37 PM] jl777c#5810
which is good for the system as this is opposite of proper trading. you cut your losses short and ride your winners. but this looking at changing costbasis and equity, people cant help but put more money into losing positions


[18-Apr-19 11:39 PM] jl777c#5810
we do need to have actual traders use the system to see how things work at high margin, especially how much bankroll is needed.


[18-Apr-19 11:40 PM] jl777c#5810
in case there isnt enough funds, i think we just socialize things and prorate the payouts by the total equity in the system


[18-Apr-19 11:41 PM] jl777c#5810
we also need ways for equity to be able to be injected into the system, probably via some otherwise illegal synthetic "DONATION"


[18-Apr-19 11:41 PM] jl777c#5810
so many unspecified details to fill in to make a working system


[18-Apr-19 11:41 PM] jl777c#5810
but before getting sucked into all this, the pull request for the assets crosschain is needed


[18-Apr-19 11:42 PM] dimxy#2587
BTW for this kind of costbasis calculation I think we always would report zero or losses for time<24?
as costbasis always >= price for long and backwards for shorts


[18-Apr-19 11:46 PM] dimxy#2587
(for assets migration there is a tasks to do: get to a unified burn tx and import tx structure with coda and gateways import as those tx are shared)


[18-Apr-19 11:53 PM] jl777c#5810
but what if the price drops?


[18-Apr-19 11:53 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, yes, 0 profits or losses


[18-Apr-19 11:54 PM] jl777c#5810
that is fine, after all the first hours of the 24hr delay can be easily predicted as the history that will be used is already known


[18-Apr-19 11:54 PM] jl777c#5810
the best traders will start the 24hrs with a 0 loss position


[18-Apr-19 11:55 PM] jl777c#5810
lets get tony what he needs to make progress and you can finish the PR

I use komodo_getprice to get  correlated and smoothed price (and take them in [1] and [2] offsets of returned buffer)
I see it returns values with the lowest 4 digits filled with non-zero:
  "lastprice": 5262.82240206,


[19-Apr-19 01:30 AM] dimxy#2587
"lastprice": 5262.86241241,


[19-Apr-19 01:40 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, only the smoothed price should be used for costbasis calcs


[19-Apr-19 01:41 AM] jl777c#5810
it does get some fractional data, but overflow is not a good thing so we need to sacrifice them, it is a bit of false precision anyway


[19-Apr-19 01:48 AM] dimxy#2587
oh yes, it is from smoothed calculations


[19-Apr-19 01:49 AM] jl777c#5810
correlated shouldnt have any extra precision


[19-Apr-19 02:31 AM] jl777c#5810
@Mihailo @TonyL for REKT1 I want to make it a sidechain for BET, that will allow us to test it even without tokens betting support. Also it will test sidechains with real money at stake. I am hoping to integrate the snapshot payments CC -ac_script so the fees are blockchain enforced to go to coin hodlers, but i guess it is only for the BET that is deposited and converted to REKT1


[19-Apr-19 02:33 AM] jl777c#5810
so REKT1 will be combined testing of sidechain gateways CC, prices CC and snapshot payments CC and will create what i think is one of the first fully automated money making system that distributes automatically to the stakeholders


[19-Apr-19 02:40 AM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c What should be the setup for side chains, we talked that there should be minimal funds on side chain and minimal mining reward so that it does not influence the number of coins?


[19-Apr-19 02:43 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, -ac_end=1 would be required, if not set then it should abort at startup


[19-Apr-19 02:43 AM] jl777c#5810
-ac_supply must also be 0


[19-Apr-19 02:44 AM] jl777c#5810
it also needs -earlytxid so if that is not set, also startshutdown


[19-Apr-19 02:45 AM] Mihailo#5902
Ok, didn't know about -ac_end...


[19-Apr-19 02:45 AM] jl777c#5810
there will be a small number of coins generated still due to magic calcs for testing and issuing the initial tx


[19-Apr-19 02:46 AM] Mihailo#5902
Yes, we need some coins for initial bind tx. But don't forget also for oracle publishers!


[19-Apr-19 02:46 AM] jl777c#5810
i heard it said that there are a "ridiculous number of -ac options"


[19-Apr-19 02:46 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, i think around 10 coins will be issued


[19-Apr-19 02:46 AM] Mihailo#5902
Well, now when I look komodo_globals.h, maybe it is true 😄


[19-Apr-19 02:46 AM] jl777c#5810
which wont be any issue for any chain other than BTC


[19-Apr-19 02:47 AM] Mihailo#5902
So what does ac_end do?


[19-Apr-19 02:47 AM] jl777c#5810
for such chains, we just need to rely on chain creator to burn any excess after all is in place, though having to pay 0,0001 BTC per tx changes the "tx are basically free" concept


[19-Apr-19 02:47 AM] jl777c#5810
ac_end stops mining rewards at that height


[19-Apr-19 02:47 AM] Mihailo#5902
Aha


[19-Apr-19 02:47 AM] Mihailo#5902
So where does the txfee go?


[19-Apr-19 02:47 AM] jl777c#5810
miners


[19-Apr-19 02:48 AM] Mihailo#5902
To the miners, they have just txfee?


[19-Apr-19 02:48 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[19-Apr-19 02:48 AM] Mihailo#5902
Ok


[19-Apr-19 02:48 AM] jl777c#5810
which for BTC sidechain might actually get some decent hashrate


[19-Apr-19 02:48 AM] jl777c#5810
50 cents per tx...


[19-Apr-19 02:48 AM] Mihailo#5902
So when everything is set, the oraclepublishers should never get out of funds. They will be miners and publishers?


[19-Apr-19 02:49 AM] Mihailo#5902
Or if there are other miners, then they can get out of funds?


[19-Apr-19 02:49 AM] jl777c#5810
yes its true


[19-Apr-19 02:49 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess a BTC sidechain might need some special rules


[19-Apr-19 02:49 AM] jl777c#5810
lets not do it!


[19-Apr-19 02:50 AM] jl777c#5810
BTC would be via token only, then none of it is lost to txfees


[19-Apr-19 02:50 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD sidechain, is ok as chain creator can just fund the oracles with enough KMD to pay for the txfees


[19-Apr-19 02:50 AM] jl777c#5810
0.1 KMD per day?


[19-Apr-19 02:50 AM] Mihailo#5902
Depending on how much publishers there is.


[19-Apr-19 02:50 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, we would want to collect the rewards from the deposits


[19-Apr-19 02:51 AM] jl777c#5810
so that is some additional oraclefeed thing to do later. consolidating utxo and collecting rewards


[19-Apr-19 02:51 AM] jl777c#5810
the former useful for all gateways


[19-Apr-19 02:52 AM] Mihailo#5902
In case of lets say 10 publishers. 1440*10ksat * 10 publishers= 1.4 KMD per day if my calc is right


[19-Apr-19 02:53 AM] Mihailo#5902
0.14 per publisher per day


[19-Apr-19 02:53 AM] jl777c#5810
we dont need all to be publishing every block


[19-Apr-19 02:53 AM] Mihailo#5902
we need at least n/2 to have publishing


[19-Apr-19 02:54 AM] Mihailo#5902
But to be sure it is working it must be more (if some is down)


[19-Apr-19 02:54 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess it is a cost we need to pay. 500 KMD per year


[19-Apr-19 02:54 AM] jl777c#5810
so if 100,000 is deposited, it will be from rewards. ok, that works assuming we can collecte the msig rewards


[19-Apr-19 02:55 AM] Mihailo#5902
The msig should basically pay it self, the marker for msig is spent on last markdonetx for tx fee.


[19-Apr-19 02:56 AM] Mihailo#5902
On withdraw it is created and spent in every sign tx and then spent for txfee in markdone.


[19-Apr-19 02:58 AM] Mihailo#5902
Deposit tx in case of sidechains does not have any markers and txfee either as it is import tx.


[19-Apr-19 02:59 AM] Mihailo#5902
So it is selfcontained system. The only cost is the tx fee of withdraw and msig signing.


[19-Apr-19 03:00 AM] jl777c#5810
oracles seems the main cost


[19-Apr-19 03:00 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe we make it so that the oracles tx on the sidechain are free?


[19-Apr-19 03:02 AM] Mihailo#5902
Yeah, that is the cost of maintaining the system


[19-Apr-19 03:02 AM] jl777c#5810
i think @blackjok8r made some free tx possible in the miners for notarization, but if ( KOMODO_SIDECHAIN != 0 && valid oracletx )


[19-Apr-19 03:03 AM] jl777c#5810
then the miners will mine oracle txid without txfee, or if some txfee is needed for the CC logic, some really small amount


[19-Apr-19 03:36 AM] Mihailo#5902
So to summarize ac params, beside ac_import, ac_end=1 and ac_supply=0 should be set, anything else that should exit the daemon if not set?


[19-Apr-19 03:39 AM] jl777c#5810
ac_perc needs to be 0 too

we need to test to make sure only txfees go to miners


[19-Apr-19 03:42 AM] Mihailo#5902
So the ac_perc should also be added to shutdown condition or is already added somewhere?


[19-Apr-19 03:43 AM] jl777c#5810
should be added, there is no special detect for sidechain shutdown conditions, you are writing the first


[19-Apr-19 03:43 AM] jl777c#5810
the ac options setting is really not so complex, there are just so many of them

costbasis print is wrong


[19-Apr-19 03:49 AM] TonyL#3577
From which moment `rekt` start to display and am I understand correct that it's a liquidation price?


[19-Apr-19 03:49 AM] jl777c#5810
costbasis has to be at least 5293.97990000 as that was the open price


[19-Apr-19 03:50 AM] jl777c#5810
so there is at least a 5263.45900000/5293.97990000 - 1 percentage loss


[19-Apr-19 03:51 AM] jl777c#5810
-0.5765208893219 % loss but at 100x leverage that is 57.6% loss of equity


[19-Apr-19 03:51 AM] jl777c#5810
rekt would be if you go below 10% of (positionsize + addedbets)


[19-Apr-19 03:52 AM] TonyL#3577
`  "profits": 0.00000000,`  should be profits kinda -57.6 on this point?


[19-Apr-19 03:52 AM] jl777c#5810
-0.576 of 1


[19-Apr-19 03:52 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh this bet is 1 yes, thought it's 100


[19-Apr-19 03:53 AM] TonyL#3577
`rekt would be if you go below 10% of (positionsize + addedbets)` yup, but it's definetly not 0


[19-Apr-19 03:53 AM] jl777c#5810
my code had it at 0, but with the chance to add funds, it seems better to add some buffer zone to rekt positions even with some profit so we boost the blockchain bankroll


[19-Apr-19 03:54 AM] jl777c#5810
if you lose 90%, basically it is rekt anyway


[19-Apr-19 03:54 AM] TonyL#3577
~50%  of positions with levarage for example 777 (any very high leverage) will be rekt in 1 block


[19-Apr-19 03:55 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm my daemon hanged


[19-Apr-19 03:56 AM] jl777c#5810
we are planning to only allow rekt to happen after 24hours, so you can be panicking for a day


[19-Apr-19 03:57 AM] TonyL#3577
Ah, so technically I might be rekt in one minute but in fact position will be opened 24 hours?


[19-Apr-19 03:57 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure yet


[19-Apr-19 03:58 AM] jl777c#5810
it might give too much of an advantage


[19-Apr-19 03:58 AM] jl777c#5810
we might make it so that if a position is rekt after the costbasis is establishedm then it is rekt


[19-Apr-19 03:58 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm, if you rekt - you rekt and position liquidated. Not sure if it can work diffent way


[19-Apr-19 03:58 AM] jl777c#5810
at 777x margin a 0.15% move in the wrong direction will wipe it out


[19-Apr-19 03:59 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, ok, @dimxy, make it so


[19-Apr-19 03:59 AM] TonyL#3577
Otherwise you can play with additionalfunding and never be rekt


[19-Apr-19 03:59 AM] jl777c#5810
if a position is rekt, even without costbasis tx, it can be rekt


[19-Apr-19 03:59 AM] TonyL#3577
Just need big pockets and mathematically correct risk managament and will win in 100% of cases I think (in case of 24h immune to rekt)


[19-Apr-19 04:04 AM] TonyL#3577

[19-Apr-19 04:05 AM] TonyL#3577
Or just not stopped correctly (my daemon hanged and I killed its process)


[19-Apr-19 04:07 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, what I proposed first did not have any thorough risk management analysis. i think once it comes together we can see how exactly it works and tweak things till it wont be bankruptable


[19-Apr-19 04:07 AM] jl777c#5810
with bitmex they charge a fee on the entire leveraged amount, so the max leverage cant be more than 100x


[19-Apr-19 04:07 AM] jl777c#5810
and they liquidate before it goes to 0 equity


[19-Apr-19 04:07 AM] jl777c#5810
i want to charge less, but still have it so the overall bankroll will be growing over time


[19-Apr-19 04:08 AM] jl777c#5810
just not needed to be 22,000 BTC in a year


[19-Apr-19 04:08 AM] TonyL#3577
BTC 2200 more probable that 22000 atm 😃


[19-Apr-19 04:10 AM] jl777c#5810
I mean the bitmex insurance fund that is funded by the rekt


[19-Apr-19 04:10 AM] jl777c#5810
that doesnt even count the trading fees


[19-Apr-19 04:11 AM] jl777c#5810
bitmex insurance fund up to 22000 BTC ,iguess in 3 years


[19-Apr-19 04:11 AM] TonyL#3577

It's added 1 satoshi


[19-Apr-19 04:18 AM] TonyL#3577
So `positionsize` is `intialbetsize`, `equity` is `initialbetsize` + `addedbets`


[19-Apr-19 04:18 AM] jl777c#5810
+ profit


[19-Apr-19 04:18 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe rename`positionsize` to `initialbetsize` ? It's quite confusing


[19-Apr-19 04:18 AM] jl777c#5810
well the initial bet is the size of the position


[19-Apr-19 04:19 AM] TonyL#3577
But there is added funding


[19-Apr-19 04:19 AM] jl777c#5810
it might be that we cant allow funds to be added and maintain risk management


[19-Apr-19 04:19 AM] TonyL#3577
Which actually enlarging your position


[19-Apr-19 04:19 AM] jl777c#5810
no


[19-Apr-19 04:19 AM] jl777c#5810
the definition i am using is the position is what the leverage applies to


[19-Apr-19 04:20 AM] jl777c#5810
otherwise if you have a 50% loss and addfunding 50% is lost immediate


[19-Apr-19 04:20 AM] jl777c#5810
i think there is a possible attack...


[19-Apr-19 04:20 AM] TonyL#3577
Ok, so ` "addedbets"` should be `addedmargin` maybe


[19-Apr-19 04:20 AM] jl777c#5810
make a small bet at 777 leverage


[19-Apr-19 04:21 AM] jl777c#5810
as it goes negative add enough margin to prevent being rekt


[19-Apr-19 04:21 AM] jl777c#5810
if on average you add less than 777x small bet size, you end up ahead


[19-Apr-19 04:21 AM] jl777c#5810
so i think the rekt percentage should change based on leverage


[19-Apr-19 04:22 AM] jl777c#5810
at no leverage you are not rekt till negative


[19-Apr-19 04:22 AM] jl777c#5810
at high leverage you are rekt at something higher, like 30%?


[19-Apr-19 04:22 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure need some modeling on this


[19-Apr-19 04:22 AM] TonyL#3577
Bitmex connecting margin to rektprice - when you adding more margin to position your rektprice moving


[19-Apr-19 04:23 AM] TonyL#3577
quite clearly for trader in such case


[19-Apr-19 04:23 AM] TonyL#3577
You can also take back some (or all) added margin if your position stands good


[19-Apr-19 04:24 AM] TonyL#3577
So for now: 
```costbasis print is wrong
rekt price showing as 0
profits showing as 0
priceaddfunding add funding in satoshis```
@dimxy


[19-Apr-19 04:28 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, lets change it to work more like bitmex


[19-Apr-19 04:29 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe I just not understood current clue so far with costbasis


[19-Apr-19 04:30 AM] jl777c#5810
the big issue is that we use the 24hour average


[19-Apr-19 04:31 AM] jl777c#5810
that means if the mined price is significantly above the smoothed price, a price rise for the next 24hrs is already baked in


[19-Apr-19 04:31 AM] jl777c#5810
it cant help but go up


[19-Apr-19 04:31 AM] jl777c#5810
so we cant let bettors use future knowledge. any such future knowledge, leveraged and bankroll is gone


[19-Apr-19 04:31 AM] TonyL#3577
Attacks vectors on oracle stops us to use realtime price?


[19-Apr-19 04:32 AM] jl777c#5810
the chain will stop if the oracle is someone stopped


[19-Apr-19 04:32 AM] jl777c#5810
but yes, we cant use the mined price due to the 2% attack


[19-Apr-19 04:32 AM] jl777c#5810
miner would just need to bias price 1% higher, place a bet, then bias -1%, to get a 2% swing, which under leverage is enormous


[19-Apr-19 04:33 AM] jl777c#5810
so we do the prior 24hr 51% correlation using a deterministic random. that means a miner can bias it +/-1% but wont know which block (if any) it will be used in and much less likely if it is a biased price


[19-Apr-19 04:34 AM] jl777c#5810
so we get the correlated price, but that is literally a random price from the prior day that just happened to be correlated with a majority of prices


[19-Apr-19 04:34 AM] TonyL#3577
https://www.bitmex.com/app/index/.BXBT maybe use such index - so to move price 1% you have to move it on all exchanges

[19-Apr-19 04:34 AM] jl777c#5810
but it is not useful for trading due to this choppiness


[19-Apr-19 04:34 AM] jl777c#5810
but the miner can submit a +/-1% price


[19-Apr-19 04:35 AM] jl777c#5810
doesnt matter the source


[19-Apr-19 04:35 AM] TonyL#3577
Ah, submit into oracle


[19-Apr-19 04:35 AM] jl777c#5810
so the average of the prior 24hrs is the trustless price feed


[19-Apr-19 04:35 AM] jl777c#5810
but this has 24hrs of future knowledge that hasnt been incorporated yet


[19-Apr-19 04:35 AM] jl777c#5810
so....


[19-Apr-19 04:35 AM] jl777c#5810
the cost basis needs to be based on the max value of the pricefeed for 24hrs


[19-Apr-19 04:37 AM] jl777c#5810
so that is the thinking behind the costbasis changing during the first 24hrs


[19-Apr-19 04:48 AM] dimxy#2587
Now profits is 0 as costbasis=lastprice


[19-Apr-19 04:55 AM] jl777c#5810
it shouldnt always be the last price


[19-Apr-19 04:55 AM] jl777c#5810
only if lastprice is the MAX


[19-Apr-19 04:55 AM] jl777c#5810
otherwise there would be a loss


[19-Apr-19 04:57 AM] dimxy#2587
Firstheight block was skipped for calc
Maybe for the blocks after , the lastprice is max indeed


[19-Apr-19 07:40 AM] Mihailo#5902

[19-Apr-19 01:18 PM] jl777c#5810
good!


[19-Apr-19 01:18 PM] jl777c#5810
so now there should be a loss if ever the price is lower


[19-Apr-19 01:19 PM] TonyL#3577
I wonder it should be a profit now because it's long and last price (and costbasis) is > than firstprice


[19-Apr-19 01:20 PM] jl777c#5810
no the costbasis is what you paid for


[19-Apr-19 01:20 PM] jl777c#5810
remember the "cant use future info" rule


[19-Apr-19 01:20 PM] jl777c#5810
so the price you paid for it wont be known for 24 hours


[19-Apr-19 01:20 PM] jl777c#5810
if you paid the same price as it is now, 0 profits


[19-Apr-19 01:20 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha, so game will actually start in 24hours


[19-Apr-19 01:20 PM] jl777c#5810
for the first 24hrs the best you can do is breakeven


[19-Apr-19 01:20 PM] jl777c#5810
you can get rekt within 24 hours like you suggested, when that is implemented


[19-Apr-19 01:21 PM] jl777c#5810
so there is the game of how much will you put into the position before the 24hrs


[19-Apr-19 01:21 PM] TonyL#3577
Finally almost collected  in head puzzle how it works


[19-Apr-19 01:21 PM] TonyL#3577
Will price from which I start be fixed automatically in 24 hours?


[19-Apr-19 01:21 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, after 24 hours there is the costbasis that is permanent


[19-Apr-19 01:22 PM] jl777c#5810
if you can make a strategy that wins more than random chance, that is a bug


[19-Apr-19 01:22 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm, some "blocks_until_costbasis_fixed" timer might be very helpful imo


[19-Apr-19 01:23 PM] TonyL#3577
`if you can make a strategy that wins more than random chance, that is a bug` - have to make timemachine for it I think


[19-Apr-19 01:24 PM] jl777c#5810
then we are good and it is a matter to tune the monetization, rekt percentages, limits on addingfunds?


[19-Apr-19 01:24 PM] jl777c#5810
stuff like that


[19-Apr-19 01:25 PM] TonyL#3577
So for now I have to open few positions and wait 24 hours to see what will happen.

Maybe we can make some "temporary testing" version in which lock will happen in a few minutes to not wait 1 day to test rekt/profit claim cases?


[19-Apr-19 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, good idea to have a version that locks costbasis in 3 blocks to allow for fast testing


[19-Apr-19 01:26 PM] TonyL#3577
`then we are good and it is a matter to tune the monetization, rekt percentages, limits on addingfunds?` - I tried only longs and only with BTC_USD pair so far


[19-Apr-19 01:26 PM] TonyL#3577
So have to check what happens in case of shorts and create some indexes/synthetic pairs


[19-Apr-19 01:27 PM] jl777c#5810
true, there could well be bugs in the synthetic construction, which needs to also be displayed in the JSON


[19-Apr-19 01:28 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems this is coming together pretty fast

{Reactions}
🚀 

[19-Apr-19 01:28 PM] jl777c#5810
once the basics are working, we can add token betting


[19-Apr-19 01:28 PM] TonyL#3577
And some interface hehe 😃


[19-Apr-19 01:29 PM] jl777c#5810
that too, but now you understand the game, i think you will have some good ideas for it

{Reactions}
👍 

[19-Apr-19 01:30 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, i think i know how to compensate for people adding funds


[19-Apr-19 01:30 PM] jl777c#5810
the more you add, the higher the rekt liquidation percentage is


[19-Apr-19 01:30 PM] jl777c#5810
at some point it wont help even to add more funds


[19-Apr-19 01:31 PM] jl777c#5810
this needs to be tuned a bit, but we can cancel out whatever advantage comes from being able to bail out bad positions with a lot of funds


[19-Apr-19 01:31 PM] TonyL#3577
Just realized what is missing in `pricesinfo` - construction which I used on bet / trading pair


[19-Apr-19 01:31 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, the synthetic it represent


[19-Apr-19 01:33 PM] jl777c#5810
if normally -90% and you are rekt, if you addfunds equal to the initial bet, then maybe -80% and you are rekt


[19-Apr-19 01:33 PM] jl777c#5810
add another and it is -70%


[19-Apr-19 01:33 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe not a linear thing, but that type of effect


[19-Apr-19 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
so where the additional money you put at risk, it shouldnt change the odds to much, more a double or nothing proposition


[19-Apr-19 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
as you play this, think about where the rekt percentage would need to be for you to not add more funds


[19-Apr-19 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
probably we could model this mathematically... but i dont know how


[19-Apr-19 01:34 PM] TonyL#3577
Who will have control over "rekted" funds?


[19-Apr-19 01:35 PM] jl777c#5810
the blockchain


[19-Apr-19 01:35 PM] jl777c#5810
it is where winners are paid from


[19-Apr-19 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
so as more and more people lose, bigger and bigger bets can be made


[19-Apr-19 01:36 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha, so have to design it the way in which it's not drained


[19-Apr-19 01:36 PM] TonyL#3577
If it drained = game over 😃


[19-Apr-19 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
speaking of which, we need to be able to see globally how much has been bet and how much is at risk


[19-Apr-19 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
blockchain deaded


[19-Apr-19 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
well the game on the chain


[19-Apr-19 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
somebody would need to give it CPR by adding funds


[19-Apr-19 01:37 PM] TonyL#3577
I think that chain coins will be "utility" more for such game


[19-Apr-19 01:38 PM] TonyL#3577
Some external assets peged to this coin and reflected on game chain will act as a value holders


[19-Apr-19 01:38 PM] TonyL#3577
Because if there is a risk of dead chain - unlikely there are reasons to have this chain coin itself value


[19-Apr-19 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
unless the chain is a sidechain


[19-Apr-19 01:39 PM] TonyL#3577
Yeah, thats what I'm thinking about 😃


[19-Apr-19 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
that already has value


[19-Apr-19 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
that is why I want it to be a BET sidechain


[19-Apr-19 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
REKT0, REKT1, REKT2,... ,might all get bankrupted


[19-Apr-19 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
but as we tune it we will get the right formula


[19-Apr-19 01:40 PM] TonyL#3577
It's very interesting concept - instead of  many coins  creation with unclear value proect some valuable assets on it and use some chains as utility only


[19-Apr-19 01:41 PM] jl777c#5810
the real BET chain is the store of value


[19-Apr-19 01:41 PM] jl777c#5810
these sidechains are experimental chains that once we tune it so it is fair but not going to bankrupt itself, then maybe the majority of BET will move to that instance of the sidechain


[19-Apr-19 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
even if the game is bankrupted, the BET coins are won by someone, who can just redeem to BET and deposit in the next REKTi chain


[19-Apr-19 01:42 PM] TonyL#3577
We can setup `BET` <-> `BET Token on REKT chain` gateways maybe


[19-Apr-19 01:42 PM] jorian#4555
👀 i read BET


[19-Apr-19 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
simpler just to have a sidechain


[19-Apr-19 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
also, this combines with the payments CC snapshot address that will collect the betting fees, so the holders of the REKT get the payouts whenever there is enough fees to fund a snapshot

{Reactions}
💪 

[19-Apr-19 01:44 PM] jl777c#5810
at that point, then most all the BET should move into the sidechain


[19-Apr-19 01:45 PM] jl777c#5810
once there is a self-sustaining game, the BET becomes a totally automated money making machine


[19-Apr-19 01:46 PM] TonyL#3577
Autonomous financial markets - very futuristc 😃


[19-Apr-19 01:47 PM] TonyL#3577
I have a bit of a mundane question: how to open short?


[19-Apr-19 01:47 PM] TonyL#3577
Ah, maybe minus before leverage


[19-Apr-19 01:48 PM] TonyL#3577
`"BTC_USD, 1"` - also am I understand correct that 1 means amount of pairs I've used?


[19-Apr-19 01:48 PM] jl777c#5810
negative leverage


[19-Apr-19 01:48 PM] jl777c#5810
you need a weight to push the top of stack into the accumulator


[19-Apr-19 01:48 PM] jl777c#5810
"BTC_USD, 1, BTC_EUR, 2"


[19-Apr-19 01:49 PM] jl777c#5810
that would weigh BTC_EUR price double that of BTC_USD


[19-Apr-19 01:49 PM] TonyL#3577
I see


[19-Apr-19 01:49 PM] jl777c#5810
"BTC_USD, USD_JPY, *, 1, BTC_EUR, 2"


[19-Apr-19 01:49 PM] jl777c#5810
that would weigh BTC_EUR price double that of BTC_JPY


[19-Apr-19 01:50 PM] jl777c#5810
it is just like a calculator, push push, operator


[19-Apr-19 01:50 PM] jl777c#5810

[19-Apr-19 01:51 PM] TonyL#3577

[19-Apr-19 02:07 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, should be


[19-Apr-19 02:08 PM] jl777c#5810
1 BTC_JPY + 2 BTC_EUR / 3


[19-Apr-19 02:09 PM] TonyL#3577
Why `1 BTC_JPY` - isnt weights sum should be equal 1 ?


[19-Apr-19 02:10 PM] jl777c#5810
1+2/3


[19-Apr-19 02:11 PM] jl777c#5810

[19-Apr-19 02:16 PM] TonyL#3577
Things which we need so far:
1) Test mode with price lock after 3 blocks instead of 24 hours
2) Synthetic print in `pricesinfo`
3)  getprice rpc call where you can pass in a synthetic string and height and get price
4) "blocks_until_costbasis_lock" indicator in `pricesinfo`

[20-Apr-19 12:28 AM] dimxy#2587
@TonyL  did you downloaded my last prices update (I corrected the costbasis calculation - seems  the prints above indicate there are no the last changes)?


[20-Apr-19 02:02 AM] TonyL#3577
@dimxy yes, costbasis in prints following last price


[20-Apr-19 02:02 AM] jl777c#5810
always? it should be MAX of all prices during 24hrs


[20-Apr-19 02:18 AM] TonyL#3577
Let me track more carefully to see if it MAX or follow on declines


[20-Apr-19 02:37 AM] dimxy#2587
No, the last changes are probably there.
The issue with this call /komodo-cli -ac_name=REKT0 pricesinfo 909291ca7715b14d502899012c8fe797230091deae3ae47c08626657f8a02ba7
was that the sample size was actually only 1 block == 2397. So obviously costbasis == lastprice in this case.
I can see the difference with the firstprice value. It is because firstprice is calculated differently from the costbasis and lastprice, with no minmax calculation, just the smoothed value.

Atm `lastprice` and `costbasis` in this position not matching any of values from last prices


[20-Apr-19 03:22 AM] dimxy#2587
firstprice is the smoothed value from the firstheight block=2397
costbasis is the min (if lev < ) of correlated and smoothed  valuues from the period from firstheight till the height which is passed as pricesinfo param 
(and if its is omitted then lastblock) or 24h  - whatever first


[20-Apr-19 03:38 AM] jl777c#5810
if negative leverage, it is the MIN[]


[20-Apr-19 03:50 AM] TonyL#3577
Negative leverage bets profit if price is falling, positive leverage if rising


[20-Apr-19 03:51 AM] TonyL#3577
So profits calculation should be different too for negative leverage (if it the same now)


[20-Apr-19 03:51 AM] jl777c#5810
profits calc multiplies by leverage


[20-Apr-19 03:51 AM] jl777c#5810
so if it would have made money as a long trade, it loses as a short

Profit and loss in LONG and SHORT non linear in bitmex , due  all contracts  settlement in BTC .  And you can choose isolated margin or cross (all in).

At the moment `priceslist` returns list of all bets on chain what is not very useful. I think it will be great if there will be separation between pending and finished bets and also `mypriceslist` to get list of user bets (similar to rogue)

If in satoshis it might be fine


[20-Apr-19 11:16 PM] TonyL#3577
But I should be in loss in this short, not profit - last price is higher than both firstprice and cost basis


[20-Apr-19 11:17 PM] TonyL#3577
So not sure why it looks reasonable tbh


[20-Apr-19 11:19 PM] TonyL#3577
If costbasis representing my position its less than 1% profit so shohld be not more than 100% profit with 100 leverage


[20-Apr-19 11:24 PM] jl777c#5810

[20-Apr-19 11:27 PM] TonyL#3577
Rekt on long looks reasonable yup


[20-Apr-19 11:30 PM] jl777c#5810
it is down by about 1.2%, so it is indeed rekt and without any rekt miners it was able to live past its death. but for such positions, it would be able to be rekt using the first block that it was rekt and shouldnt be able to be cashed out


[20-Apr-19 11:30 PM] jl777c#5810
however if it goes back into profit before someone rekts it, then i guess a cashout would be possible


[20-Apr-19 11:32 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha, so some "rektbot" scanner is needed


[20-Apr-19 11:33 PM] TonyL#3577
Like a anybody can initiate rekt for someone position if `rekt: 1` but only opener can initiate close not into rekt?


[20-Apr-19 11:34 PM] TonyL#3577
If needed I can start simple scanner which will check positions for "rekt 1" and close it

only people that want to earn money from generating rekt transactions should be scanning

[23-Apr-19 07:48 AM] TonyL#3577
https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/32YYcqPkrw/ not totally understand how it works, but after costbasis fixing `profit` changing  (costbasis value remains the same)


[23-Apr-19 07:51 AM] TonyL#3577
Looks like before `pricessetcostbasis` field `profit` reflects some not correct value and after this call it became correct


[23-Apr-19 11:51 AM] dimxy#2587
before  pricessetcostbasis call, a temp costbasis is used which is calculated with another algorithm ('minmax')


[23-Apr-19 11:54 AM] jl777c#5810
the minmax needs to be used for the pricessetcostbasis call also!


[23-Apr-19 11:54 AM] jl777c#5810
there should be no sudden change in costbasis


[23-Apr-19 11:54 AM] jl777c#5810
and the same should be used for permanent as the minmax


[23-Apr-19 11:58 AM] dimxy#2587
yes, however for the permanent costbasis it is calculated as max (or min) value for the single point at 24h
and for temp costbasis (before 24h) it is additionally calculated as max (or min) for the point for the total period  for firstheight to refheight!


[23-Apr-19 11:59 AM] dimxy#2587
that is why the difference might be


[23-Apr-19 11:59 AM] dimxy#2587
(or this needs to be corrected?)


[23-Apr-19 12:00 PM] jl777c#5810
it needs to be corrected


[23-Apr-19 12:01 PM] jl777c#5810
the permanent costbasis should be the max (or min) for entire first 24 hour period


[23-Apr-19 12:01 PM] jl777c#5810
regardless of when the tx is actually made


[23-Apr-19 12:06 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm still not understand clear purpose of `pricessetcostbasis` call. By design - should it be done by trader or some automated tool? Why this basis cost can't be set automatically after bet "maturing" ?


[23-Apr-19 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
who sets it?


[23-Apr-19 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
it is an "event" the passage of 24hrs


[23-Apr-19 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
so an incentivized tx is use to have users "mine" it


[23-Apr-19 12:08 PM] TonyL#3577
There is a RPC call `pricessetcostbasis bettxid` which I have to execute and broadcast transaction for it before execution of `pricescashout bettxid`


[23-Apr-19 12:08 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, initial design required a costbasis set before cashout is allowed


[23-Apr-19 12:09 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha, so in app when user click "cashout" I just can broadcast `pricessetcostbasis` and `pricescashout`


[23-Apr-19 12:10 PM] TonyL#3577
And user will see only pricescashout output


[23-Apr-19 12:11 PM] TonyL#3577
Ok, so just need some maturity flag to make cashout button active only for positions for which possible to call `pricessetcostbasis`


[23-Apr-19 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
yes the one doing cashout can do a costbasis first


[23-Apr-19 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
one there are miners for this, it shouldnt be an issue


[23-Apr-19 12:49 PM] dimxy#2587
again about costbasis.

the min value is only for the greenline


[23-Apr-19 01:18 PM] dimxy#2587
So costbasis is the max of smoothed values
And what about cashout price value?

[23-Apr-19 01:25 PM] dimxy#2587
if I want to cashout at t=T2 
it seems logical if the cashout price value is calculated by a similar way as costbasis (that is, as the max for the following 24h?)
(the value V2 on the screen is how the cashout price is calculated now)


[23-Apr-19 01:33 PM] jl777c#5810
no, the cashout price is the smoothed price at the current height


[23-Apr-19 01:33 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess prior block value


[23-Apr-19 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
the costbasis is the max, the cashout is the current value


[23-Apr-19 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
this is the house edge and compensates for the fee being on just the amount bet, instead of leveraged amount, which is in some cases 100x lower fee


[23-Apr-19 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
cashout must use the realtime price


[23-Apr-19 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
so there is no waiting, it closes the position and it uses just the smoothed price


[23-Apr-19 01:38 PM] jl777c#5810
so costbasis is recalculated during first 24 hours using max (or min) of smoothed price and the permanent one is just the last value

{Reactions}
👌 

[23-Apr-19 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
current price is always the current price and that is used for cashout


[23-Apr-19 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
for rekt, ANY height can be used. I think we need a special case to allow rekt of a position before 24hrs without a permanent costbasis


[23-Apr-19 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
or maybe we can actually get rid of the costbasis tx, it seems like the appendix. a tx without any known reason


[23-Apr-19 01:41 PM] jl777c#5810
i think allowing  position to be rekt during first 24 hours deprecates the costbasis tx and we just need to calculate it all the time for cashout and rekt

{Reactions}
👌 

[23-Apr-19 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
the early rekt compensates for bettors being able to add funding


[23-Apr-19 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
the 24 hours prevents any future knowledge to be used when making the bet


[23-Apr-19 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
the percentage of equity that means rekt would need to change from 10% to higher values if funds are added. just not sure what algo to use to adjust it


[23-Apr-19 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
if we dont do that, bettors can just add 10x the value to avoid any chance of being rekt


[23-Apr-19 01:44 PM] jl777c#5810
what we want to do is tune it so that adding more funds might reduce the rekt chance in the short term, but doesnt change it much at all in the long term


[23-Apr-19 01:44 PM] jl777c#5810
so the adding funds should be equivalent to having made a bigger bet, i guess at a lower margin


[23-Apr-19 01:45 PM] jl777c#5810
open to suggestions


[23-Apr-19 01:45 PM] jl777c#5810
once we see the costbasis and profits at leverage, i think we can see how addfunds affects specific positions


[23-Apr-19 01:45 PM] jl777c#5810
it might be we have to remove the ability to be able to add funds


[23-Apr-19 01:46 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, maybe adding funds adjusts the cost basis so it is a bit more preferential, but it increases leverage?


[23-Apr-19 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
double the funds, then doubles the leverage. i think the odds of rekt are pretty much the same


[23-Apr-19 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
if this checks out, then leverage is the specified leverage * (total funds/positionsize)


[23-Apr-19 01:48 PM] jl777c#5810
it does complicate things quite a bit though if leverage is different at different heights


[23-Apr-19 01:49 PM] jl777c#5810
it might even need a bit of a delay to help save the losing position. anyway, I think you guys can see the tradeoffs and the goal, so hopefully a good solution will emerge


[23-Apr-19 02:06 PM] dimxy#2587
ok, I need to review this more carefully😀 
I can see that who bets should understand he would deal not with real values but with math processed values (more like betting on trends, not short time changes)


[23-Apr-19 02:10 PM] TonyL#3577
Betting on trend is possible when leverage is small, because with high leverage your position might be liquidated super fast and trend forming quite long. 
Usually high leverage positions (like a 100x) aimed to minute candles gambling


[23-Apr-19 02:11 PM] TonyL#3577
So if you bet with high leverage you should be able to close your position on the next price change, otherwise it have not much sense imo


[23-Apr-19 02:17 PM] TonyL#3577
With leverage below level x25 you can monitor it, carefully protect by margin adding or close by stop and your close target might be in few weeks or months, but high leverage it's pure gambling with some apofenia usually where you mostly aiming to "double or nothing" in a few minutes


[23-Apr-19 02:23 PM] jl777c#5810
for such betting needs, there is dice


[23-Apr-19 02:23 PM] jl777c#5810
prices CC is for non-minute by minute tradings


[23-Apr-19 02:24 PM] TonyL#3577
But there is a 777 max leverage 😃


[23-Apr-19 02:24 PM] jl777c#5810
somebody has to finance the payouts for the other leverages

{Reactions}
😂 

[23-Apr-19 02:24 PM] jl777c#5810
i think due to min/max any high leverage will indeed be very rare to payout, but when it does it is a crazy big amount


[23-Apr-19 02:25 PM] jl777c#5810
so we do need to have ways to see total exposure of all the bets


[23-Apr-19 02:25 PM] jl777c#5810
and then maybe to limit maxleverage*position side to be within some reasonable limits

[23-Apr-19 10:43 PM] jl777c#5810
it could be that with different versions with different validations, there are consensus conflicts


[23-Apr-19 10:44 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it is good for now to just always allow CC tx, eg. validation returns true but just have error messages instead of returning false


[23-Apr-19 10:44 PM] jl777c#5810
when all the new tx are working without error messages, then we spawn a new chain with all the validation active


[23-Apr-19 11:00 PM] dimxy#2587
I ve already guessed about just logging😀


[24-Apr-19 12:49 AM] dimxy#2587
I found  what validation error was with that txn  02d161b021fbeebd2257db135ab2463f0da4887377a9ea0526a4fa5807bc897a .
Actually I implemented a validation rule when bettx is checked if its normal inputs are really signed with the pubkey in the opret.
The idea was not to allow to do bets for others.
But if a wallet has several privkeys it might cause this rule violation.
Is this check useful?
(I think I need also to check this also at the creation of bet txns to prevent validation errors, if to do this at all. And the problem is we cannot add normal vins for the specified pk, AddNormalinputs func always adds vins for any available privkey in the wallet)


[24-Apr-19 12:52 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe change to adding just inputs from the same -pubkey?


[24-Apr-19 12:55 AM] dimxy#2587
for this we need to change AddNormalinputs (currently it does not use the pubkey param)


[24-Apr-19 12:57 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, maybe make an optional parameter that allows this


[24-Apr-19 12:58 AM] jl777c#5810
or maybe we dont care who is funding things?


[24-Apr-19 01:05 AM] dimxy#2587
ok, maybe for now it is okay to postpone this issue.
And I had the similar one for tokens: in token creation tx there is also a pubkey who created it. I thought it is good to check if token creation txn's normal inputs are really signed with the pk in the opret (to be able to trust that the token is really created with this pubkey)


[24-Apr-19 01:21 AM] jl777c#5810
the pubkey in the opreturn signifies who owns it


[24-Apr-19 01:22 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems ok to create a token on behalf of someone else


[24-Apr-19 01:42 AM] dimxy#2587
ok,
(but I thought it could be a way of cheating with tokens. As tokens are issued with some pubkey token users should trust this pubkey. So they probably want to be sure that the token was really issued with this pk. What if someone tries to create a fake token and puts in the opret a well-known pk which everybody trusts?)


[24-Apr-19 01:43 AM] jl777c#5810
but then wouldnt the token be owned by that trusted pubkey?


[24-Apr-19 01:43 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe make sure at least one vin is signed by the same pubkey?


[24-Apr-19 01:49 AM] dimxy#2587
yes, if at least one input is signed with the pubkey it would prove the ownership.

Technically the web-interface works now - have graph, showing balance, possible to open position, displaying opened postions with possibility to add leverage or cashout and also possible to check closed positions history
Only problem is that it's super ugly now 😃


[24-Apr-19 07:44 AM] dimxy#2587
I'reviewing the notes from prices.cpp. It states:
 'In order to allow finding the right costbasis, for long bets the maximum price between the correlated and smoothed price is needed over the first day after the bet. For short bets, the minimum price is needed.'
So this is going to be corrected (as we discussed earlier that costbasis is max (or min) for only green line for 24h)?

{Reactions}
🤕 

[24-Apr-19 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
change the notes


[24-Apr-19 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
only use smoothed prices


[24-Apr-19 08:59 AM] dimxy#2587
I'm thinking about adding funds to bets.
To calculate profits for a bet (without any added funds) at some moment we need a costbasis which is actually price value for the moment of position opening (calculated with some algo). Plus we need a price at this given moment. So profits(loss) = position*(price-costbasis)/costbasis*leverage
What if the bettor added some funds? Actually it means the bettor continues to believe in the price's trend.
But as he added funds later, for this addition profits/loss would be at lower proportion (it would allow to save from rekt).
So why not to calculate its own costbasis for added fund, just at the height when the fund was added? 
And the leverage should be the same, the bettor cannot change it (otherwise it would be just a new bet)

Example:
init position=1000, lev=10, costbasis=100, at some moment price=90 (the price decrease was linear)
at this moment profits=1000*10*(90-100)/100 = -1000 (complete loss)
if a fund of 1000 was added in the middle of the period, its costbasis = 95
for the added funds for the same moment profits = 1000 * 10 (90-95)/95 = -526
total profits = -1526
but total bet now = 2000, so we are not rekt!


[24-Apr-19 09:10 AM] TonyL#3577
`So why not to calculate its own costbasis for added fund, just at the height when the fund was added? ` - so added funds will be like a positions inside position which accumulating to single rekt price 
Imo there should be clear formula for rektprice movment depends of margin (aka funding) adding/taking. (added margin is single accumulated number actually) - such separation on each added funding looks like a over complication.
After position opening rekt price (price when position will be liquidated) is X, when added leverage liquadtion price is X1, when added more - liquidation price is X2


[24-Apr-19 09:10 AM] TonyL#3577
Clue is to find correct formula for liqudation price calculation depends of margin amount


[24-Apr-19 09:15 AM] TonyL#3577
Init position=1000, lev=10, costbasis 100: your liqudation price is ~90 (10% spike = 100% loss with 10x leverage)
Let's say 100 funds added to position, now you have 1100 as position amount (your funds placed into position) and initial 9000 as leveraged funds (funds added as margin so werent leveraged), so now actual leverage is less (not 1000/9000 but 1100/9000) and rekt price is moving


[24-Apr-19 09:17 AM] TonyL#3577
Marginal trading working approx like this in my understanding


[24-Apr-19 09:24 AM] dimxy#2587
yes for your example I calculated the liquidation price = 89,5
that is what adding funds allows to achieve - to add cover from losses.


[24-Apr-19 09:37 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, clearly it needs to be a deterministic formula. I think what you describe is certainly better than my initial version


[24-Apr-19 09:38 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe we can model it with a few examples and see how it works, if it seems reasonable, implement it and try it out


[24-Apr-19 09:39 AM] jl777c#5810
or if it is easy to implement it, just implement it and see if it allows for any way to cheat or have some system that can make money more than 50% of the time. We assume that price predictions without future knowledge is a 50% accuracy thing to do

[24-Apr-19 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810

[24-Apr-19 12:08 PM] dimxy#2587
What I am still concerned with is how to get the cashout price.
it was suggested to use the smoothed price at the cashout moment for it.
But smoothed price is calculated as 24h-period-averaged value and it is actually correlated to raw price at 24h ago point. 
So at the cashout moment the actual raw price might be high, but we may get it it as low just because it was also low 24h ago.


[24-Apr-19 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
it is the average value of DAYWINDOW


[24-Apr-19 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
it is correlated to the average value, so maybe 12 hours ago if it is a steady increase/decline


[24-Apr-19 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
since we calculate the costbasis from the smoothed, what is wrong with using smoothed for cashout?


[24-Apr-19 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
for longer term positions, it wont really matter that much


[24-Apr-19 12:21 PM] dimxy#2587
ok, I'll make changes and let's see what we get as profits/losses and compare it with the chart


[25-Apr-19 12:28 AM] jl777c#5810
is it my imagination or is this getting almost ready for public testing?


[25-Apr-19 12:29 AM] jl777c#5810
we can start testing before all the validations as getting user feedback is likely an important factor that will take time and can be done in parallel with validation


[25-Apr-19 12:46 AM] dimxy#2587
yes, I'm finishing the lastest changes for added bets and  making the validation less strict
and  hope it is ready for testing


[25-Apr-19 05:25 AM] Markus#5464
@jl777c how does the whole concept look like? will u be able to bet on any crypto either going up or down? will u pay with that crypto u bet on and get paid in that crypto or will there be a standard coin/token used?


[25-Apr-19 05:36 AM] jl777c#5810
for now you bet in the native coin, but we plan to add token betting


[25-Apr-19 05:37 AM] jl777c#5810
with token betting you could then bet the supported gateways CC coins


[25-Apr-19 05:37 AM] jl777c#5810
you can bet long or short, with margin for any synthetic you can construct out of the prices at http://159.69.45.70:8050/


[25-Apr-19 06:43 AM] jl777c#5810
@dimxy you will need to have some global exposure based limiting of positionsize leverage


[25-Apr-19 06:43 AM] jl777c#5810
it wont be possible to be exact but you should be able to deterministically calculate the total amount of bets that are possible to accept in a given block


[25-Apr-19 06:44 AM] jl777c#5810
then using that to approve/reject bets during validation


[25-Apr-19 06:44 AM] jl777c#5810
this way, we can avoid the system being bankrupted no matter what and if people want to allow more bets, additional funds need to be able to be added to the global balance


[25-Apr-19 06:57 AM] dimxy#2587
so it probably should take into account existing bets and  total bankroll  amount and set some bet limit to protect bankroll to go negative?


[25-Apr-19 06:58 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[25-Apr-19 06:58 AM] jl777c#5810
so at first only small bets would be able to do maxleverage


[25-Apr-19 06:59 AM] jl777c#5810
but as people get rekt the bankroll gets bigger and people can bet more and more


[25-Apr-19 06:59 AM] jl777c#5810

all validation needs to be disabled until it is merged into my repo and I update all my nodes


[26-Apr-19 12:10 AM] dimxy#2587
I've reviewed all validation once more (updated my repo). Might need to use reconsiderblock to force sync


[26-Apr-19 12:14 AM] jl777c#5810
the issue is that my nodes are not running with any validation, so if the validation on your nodes reject any tx it will fork


[26-Apr-19 12:15 AM] dimxy#2587
yes as TonyL use my repo with faulty validation he might need to  force resync after updating

aha, ok, that works too

So it outputs an array with inital bet and subsequent additions
and totals after it


[26-Apr-19 12:18 AM] jl777c#5810
if you are allowing more funds to be added, but each is treated as an independent bet? with the 24hrs scanning for MAX costbasis


[26-Apr-19 12:18 AM] jl777c#5810
otherwise future knowledge is being used with the addition of funds


[26-Apr-19 12:25 AM] dimxy#2587
For a new added bet I calculate a new costbasis beginning from the block where the bet was added and for 24h  (as max value)


[26-Apr-19 12:26 AM] jl777c#5810
i see, so it cant affect the overall success rate, other than by starting fresh it adds more equity so can move an existing positon away from the rekt percentage


[26-Apr-19 12:36 AM] dimxy#2587
yes, if for example I bet on price grow but it constantly went down, then by adding more funds I might delay the rekt


[26-Apr-19 12:36 AM] jl777c#5810
i think as long as future knowledge isnt able to be used the system will be fine


[26-Apr-19 12:36 AM] jl777c#5810
and adding more funds to a bad position is usually a bad thing


[26-Apr-19 07:17 AM] TonyL#3577
Is `pricessetcostbasis` should apply to all "subbets"? Otherwords - should I wait for all subbets to mature to fix costbasis? And what to do if pricessetcostbasis was set already


[26-Apr-19 07:19 AM] dimxy#2587
I believe we have deprecated pricessetcostbasis for now


[26-Apr-19 07:19 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh, ok great


[26-Apr-19 07:20 AM] dimxy#2587
I just scan the chain from the first height and calc the costbasis. When 24h passed I stop and use the latest value


[26-Apr-19 07:21 AM] TonyL#3577
Are these changes in some new branch?


[26-Apr-19 07:22 AM] dimxy#2587
yes, in myrepo, the branch is the same prices-rpc

Rebuilding


[26-Apr-19 07:55 AM] dimxy#2587
I see how Forex works: if I made a position  then later I can add more to it at the price active at this new moment. A position now consists of two.
So I think when we 're adding another funding we 're doing somewhat similar?

`I see how Forex works: if I made a position  then later I can add more to it at the price active at this new moment. A position now consists of two.` - trading on Bitmex let's say working different way - you can add margin to position (funds without leverage) so your leverage decreasing and rekt price moving


[26-Apr-19 07:57 AM] TonyL#3577
Never traded Forex to compare

Would be great to have some fintech-ninja advisor


[26-Apr-19 08:04 AM] TonyL#3577
Because even in Bittmex model which looks simplier than a lot of parallel bets - there are some limits for added margin, and possible to take it back on some points when your position stands good. And these values should be calculated


[26-Apr-19 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
i think like forex is good

😀 

[26-Apr-19 10:45 AM] dimxy#2587
Actually Bitmex like Forex allows adding more orders to a position (combining same orders to one position).
And Bitmex also indeed allows to add or remove margin to a position changing its leverage by this


[26-Apr-19 10:54 AM] TonyL#3577
`Actually Bitmex like Forex allows adding more orders to a position` just realised that it's a same thing which we have now 😃


[26-Apr-19 10:56 AM] TonyL#3577
Imo it'll be super clear for trader if display "synthetic on which bet was made", "average positon price", "position rekt price" for total position


[26-Apr-19 10:57 AM] TonyL#3577
` "average positon price", "position rekt price"` these things possible to calculate on interface side


[26-Apr-19 11:00 AM] dimxy#2587
well I can calculate this on the server side


[26-Apr-19 11:01 AM] TonyL#3577
```average position price = (position1size * position1price + position2size * position2price + ... + positionNsize * positionNsize) / all_positions_sizes_sum```


[26-Apr-19 11:02 AM] TonyL#3577
Should be something like this if my arithmetic correct (by positon1, position2 I mean sub-positions inside position for which we calculating average price)


[26-Apr-19 11:07 AM] TonyL#3577
Am I understand correct that now position can be counted as rekt when `-profit` = `TotalPositionSize` ?


[26-Apr-19 11:10 AM] TonyL#3577
Ah found it in comments ```    if synthetic value + amount goes negative, then anybody can rekt it to collect a rektfee```


[26-Apr-19 11:11 AM] TonyL#3577
So from your side should be not hard to display rekt price


[26-Apr-19 11:14 AM] dimxy#2587
yes I noticed Forex calculates average price in a similar way - as weighed by position sizes.
I consider rekt when  (totalbets + totalprofts) < 0 
(and I also see that it might when it reaches some percentage)


[26-Apr-19 11:16 AM] TonyL#3577
Just for player it's not clear what to track with such condition (when losses equal positon side), but when player see price on which his position will be liquidated he starting to track price


[26-Apr-19 11:17 AM] TonyL#3577
Price X on which losses will exceed the position size is predetermined so clue is only print it


[26-Apr-19 11:19 AM] dimxy#2587
yes  I will add it


[26-Apr-19 11:19 AM] TonyL#3577
Cool! I'll be able to show rekt price line on graph when player select active positon


[26-Apr-19 11:20 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm just realized that would be great to make tool which will make graphs dynamically for "non-standart" synthetics


[26-Apr-19 11:21 AM] TonyL#3577
Let's say player made some USDBTCBTC/JPYKMDSTRAT position and want to check dynamics graph for this synthetic price


[26-Apr-19 11:21 AM] TonyL#3577
Should help with debug as well, will try to make it


[26-Apr-19 11:23 AM] jl777c#5810
I think we should allow rekt before equity goes negative


[26-Apr-19 01:51 PM] dimxy#2587
As I understand it, Bitmex calls the price when all the margin is spent on  the loss (becomes == 0) as 'Bankruptcy Price'
And they set Liquidation price as some fraction from the Bankruptcy Price allowing to collect some value to the Insurance Fund. 
This fraction depends on leverage (more the leverage less the fraction) So for leverage = 1 they would have Liquidation price as 50%


[29-Apr-19 12:12 AM] dimxy#2587
@TonyL  I added the average costbasis and liqudation price  to the pricesinfo.
The liquidation price is now calculated when equity drops to 0 (but it could be easily changed to some percentage like 10%)

Would be great to display synthetic, also there was an issue with `!` (not found the way to use it) and operator  `/` created position with suspicious price. @dimxy is it fine if I open issues in your repo? (so it'll be easier to track issues on github than in chat )


[29-Apr-19 06:09 AM] dimxy#2587
yes I remember about  the synthetic
I need to either store it in the opret or write a function which would reverse parsed vector.
It's  okey to open issues in my repo, of course

[29-Apr-19 07:46 AM] dimxy#2587
if you had bash errors when using '!' operator, I managed to get it work by escaping and quoting:
./komodo-cli -ac_name=REKT0 pricesbet  0.000666 1 "BTC_USD,"\\!",1"


[29-Apr-19 07:54 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh, quotes and escaping.
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=REKT0 pricesbet  0.000666 1 "BTC_USD,"\!",1"
parsed synthetic: BTC_USD ! 1 ```
 That works, thanks!


[29-Apr-19 10:02 AM] dimxy#2587
when I calculate average costbasis,
I could lose precision or get into overflow for either BTC_USD or BTC_USD,!
seems it is time to switch into bignum lib like mini-gmp (which is already used)

LiqudationPrice looks not correct - but this position was opened before than liquadation price was added

Oh such LiqudationPrice should be because of not-correct costbasis `  "costbasis": 9.06956919,`

[29-Apr-19 01:08 PM] dimxy#2587
I temporarily switched all calculations to floating point.
So now the values should b approximately as they are supposed to be


[29-Apr-19 01:17 PM] dimxy#2587
this ./komodo-cli -ac_name=REKT0 pricesinfo e123e5cd42a2942d24a3ac9e89cef3d8c7cadf493ae7bff9db8027e16f6f5c53 really shows big loss  almost 30%
I believe because of leverage=7


[29-Apr-19 02:38 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh yes, just calculated, it's about -4% BTC spike so 4 * 7 ~28%


[29-Apr-19 03:12 PM] TonyL#3577
```I temporarily switched all calculations to floating point.

[29-Apr-19 10:20 PM] TonyL#3577
To make  graphs for "non-standart prices" and other stuff I'm making  python library which counting prices independent on client side. Main idea is possibility to operate with accessory displaying things by single prices call output evaluation to custom (not presented in pricesoutput) datasets which can be used as Python list or as CSV file let's say.

(prices call with depth 1)
```
print(visualization_lib.count_stack(rpc_connection, ["BTC_USD", "KMD_BTC", "*", 1], "1"))
 [0.938448574, 1.01312870023, 0.9942287837837783]
```

and for `./komodo-cli -ac_name=REKT0 pricesbet 1 1 "BTC_USD, KMD_BTC, *, 1"` position: 
```
...
  "LastPrice": 0.99388133,
...
}
```

Looks like it works fine - but not support many things yet. For now it possible to create "non-standart" price dataset for single stack with * or / operator.
! - will not be implemented. Instead made support of mirror pairs: e.g. USD_BTC will grab 1/BTC_USD prices


[29-Apr-19 11:35 PM] dimxy#2587
BTW  one of my tasks is the development of a rpc call which would allow to convert a non-existing pair like  KMD_JPY into a set of existing pairs "USD_JPY, USD_KMD, /,1".  This is to be done yet.

[30-Apr-19 02:03 PM] TonyL#3577
How for diametrical positions one can be in profit and other not in minus


[30-Apr-19 02:03 PM] TonyL#3577
If I've opened -10 and +10 positions at same block: if one is -0.1 I expect other to be +0.1


[30-Apr-19 02:04 PM] dimxy#2587
BTW  firstheight isnt the block where the tx is mined but equals to chaintip at the moment when the tx is created.
Maybe it is better to change it to actually mined block?


[30-Apr-19 02:05 PM] TonyL#3577
I checked `getrawtransaction 1` for these two bets and block is same for both (so profits should be equal to 0 in total I wonder): ```  "height": 3980,
  "confirmations": 5,
  "rawconfirmations": 5,
```


[30-Apr-19 02:06 PM] dimxy#2587
yes but the firstehight is 3979


[30-Apr-19 02:06 PM] dimxy#2587
I think the correct is 3980


[30-Apr-19 02:06 PM] jl777c#5810
if you do the min vs max logic, there is no assurance at all that it will be symmetric


[30-Apr-19 02:08 PM] TonyL#3577
Symmetrical positions with 2 stacks synthetic behave the same atm (short started to show some negative profits, long staying at 0)

Hmm, have to find formula, now not understand  clear how it's calculating


[30-Apr-19 02:13 PM] TonyL#3577
`min vs max logic` shouldn't it calculate as fixed costbasis vs current price?


[30-Apr-19 02:15 PM] jl777c#5810
costbasis changes every block (maybe) for first 24hrs


[30-Apr-19 02:15 PM] dimxy#2587
I calculate it as max price for longs
Or min for shorts for the period to 24h


[30-Apr-19 02:17 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha, so this logic using before costbasis is fixed on some point (24 hours or 7 blocks in test mode)


[30-Apr-19 02:19 PM] TonyL#3577
So let's say: I opened long when price was on 1000, it's spike to 1500 at hour 10, on 24th hour price down back to 1000
My costbasis fixing now.  Will it be like I'm opened long on 1500 but current price is 1000 so I'm in -33% loss?


[30-Apr-19 02:21 PM] jl777c#5810
yes!


[30-Apr-19 02:21 PM] jl777c#5810
but you can leverage it 100x or more and make up for the losses


[30-Apr-19 02:23 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha, so at first it's actually just some "replay" before real data start


[30-Apr-19 02:23 PM] TonyL#3577
Will be omegalul to be rekt during replay 😂


[30-Apr-19 02:23 PM] jl777c#5810
well i think you wanted to be able to be rekt during the first 24hrs


[30-Apr-19 02:24 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh, I've just understood system wrong before I think


[30-Apr-19 02:24 PM] jl777c#5810
we cant have future knowledge being used for the bets


[30-Apr-19 02:25 PM] TonyL#3577
Accept bets which apriori rekt by historical data It's like a accept bets on score 3-1 in football match on the next day when it finished with 0-0 score


[30-Apr-19 02:25 PM] jl777c#5810
since the greenline takes 24 hrs backwards, it is contaminated with future knowledge over the next 24hrs


[30-Apr-19 02:25 PM] jl777c#5810
but in exchange for this, you are only charge fee on the amount bet, not the leveraged amount

`ps looks awesome - is it easy to install, jl777/jl777 & tui?` - thanks 😃 yeah, at the moment it's working with dimxy repo and things not merged in komodo repos because it's in actively debugging stage
This webapp need few more pip deps but in general steps are just: 
start REKT0 chain, start `python3 prices_app_v2.py` and interface by default availiable on 777 port

@dimxy Great! Not totally understood yet how these operators work, will re-read it's description and test when wake-up


[01-May-19 03:06 AM] TonyL#3577
Or maybe understood: so by default all operators multiplying and we can choose which ones we want to flip by `/`


[01-May-19 03:08 AM] TonyL#3577
Am I understand correct that `///` operator for A/B, A/B, A/B actually will do multiplying B/A * B/A * B/A  and `***` operator for  A/B, A/B, A/B will do A/B * A/B * A/B ?


[01-May-19 03:45 AM] dimxy#2587
/// *** etc requires 3 operands


[01-May-19 03:50 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha, but between 3 operands possible to put 2 infix operators 
So actually `A/B, A/B, A/B, ///` is something like a `1 / (A/B) * 1 / (A/B) * 1 / (A/B)` ?

` "expression": "BTC_USD, KMD_BTC, *, 1, STRAT_BTC, BCHABC_BTC, /, 5") `

Maybe it is good to try to calculate a reduced expression, like \"BTC_EUR, BTC_USD, /, 1\"  is  actually \"USD_EUR, 1\" ?


[01-May-19 08:15 AM] jl777c#5810
it wont be exact, but it could be arbitraged as over time it should average the same


[01-May-19 08:43 AM] dimxy#2587
so it might be misleading for the user as he might think it is a real  currency pair?


[01-May-19 08:43 AM] jl777c#5810
displaying the synthetic solves that, plus it is the user that created it

Full expression in such form is great - quite easy for current interface code to build custom graph now on position selection 😃

```./komodo-cli -ac_name=REKT0 pricesbet 10 10 "BTC_USD, USD_RUB, KMD_BTC, ***, 1"```
and ```./komodo-cli -ac_name=REKT0 pricesbet 10 10 "BTC_USD, USD_RUB, KMD_BTC, ///, 1"```
worked fine


[01-May-19 02:03 PM] TonyL#3577
But no luck when using one or two slash in operator @dimxy 

```./komodo-cli -ac_name=REKT0 pricesbet 10 10 "BTC_USD, USD_RUB, KMD_BTC, */*, 1"

Ah, current min/max system is sharp
10+ times difference in profits on yesterdays "symmetrical" placed BTC_USD short and long

Aha, so 3 symbols operators are only `*//, **/, *** and ///`
Understood now clue why it's enough - if I need to flip first I can just put it to third position and use `**/`, so it was a false alarm regards not working operators. It working - just have to carefully test if price calculating correct for all of them

@dimxy In general what is the expected limitation on stacks amount in bet synthetic?


[02-May-19 01:30 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no limit to the accumulator


[02-May-19 01:30 AM] jl777c#5810
other than the overall length limit of opreturn


[02-May-19 01:30 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh I see, thats great


[02-May-19 01:30 AM] jl777c#5810
the weight field puts the product of the weight and top of stack to the accumulator


[02-May-19 01:30 AM] TonyL#3577
Can make indexes even like a CMC top100


[02-May-19 01:31 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, maybe not all 100 due to not being on binance or lack of opreturn space

seems like "why would people pay percentage of profits for a portfolio construction" ?


[02-May-19 01:38 AM] TonyL#3577
It's a thingy from classic investment funds - "management fee" and so on


[02-May-19 01:38 AM] TonyL#3577
And usually it's not only construction but rebalancing also

ok, lets check those things and if there is a way to limit betsize*leverage based on global funds


[02-May-19 01:53 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh yes, I tested cashout few times and it worked fine. But never rekted my bets


[02-May-19 01:53 AM] jl777c#5810
the way it would work if someone wins more than available capital, they can cashout all that is left


[02-May-19 01:54 AM] jl777c#5810
then any other positions wont be able to cashout until we get enough rekt


[02-May-19 01:54 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe that is ok, it socializes the losses and it should only be an issue at the start


[02-May-19 01:54 AM] jl777c#5810
unless someone is able to consistently beat the blockchain


[02-May-19 01:59 AM] jl777c#5810
making it a sidechain will let us test sidechains at the same time and we can bet with real value before tokens support

the equity was in global address not as a specific utxo, just credits against the global funds

for cashout, i guess it should be allowed to collect less than the equity amount if there arent enough funds left


[02-May-19 02:09 AM] jl777c#5810
i would think maxleverage would need to be capped to lower amounts, until the global funds are adequate

We can make some "risk-management" formula for fund.
Like a not to risk more than 1% of fund with approximation that bettors have 0% ROI against us


[02-May-19 02:12 AM] jl777c#5810
ok


[02-May-19 02:15 AM] TonyL#3577
Just an idea of some determenistic level defense. Because bettors can use bankroll-management, strategies with ->inf variance like a many many steps martingale, some arbitrage maybe and autonomous fund looks very defenseless


[02-May-19 02:19 AM] TonyL#3577

I updated this morning and it grabbed commits which added `reduced`, but it worked same way on yesterdays commits


[02-May-19 10:12 PM] dimxy#2587
I removed test costbasis calc  as we deprecated the costbasis tx.
Seems you need this to check profit calculations? 
Ok I willl add testmode for the costbasis


[02-May-19 10:16 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh yes, I wanted to test rekt bet actually


[02-May-19 10:26 PM] dimxy#2587
And last time when TESTMODE was active it actually changed DAY_WINDOW and it looked not so good on the chart.
I think now it is better for testing to change just costbasis calculation  period to 7 blocks but for DAY_WINDOW to set it as it is now 24h


[02-May-19 10:50 PM] dimxy#2587
and there might be  implications for this test costbasis now as we now do not use costbasis tx fixing the costbasis value:
so if a position was closed in test mode but you later recompile with no testmode, the cosybasis and profits calculations will be updated and incorrect for such positions
(updated the repo with testmode)

[02-May-19 11:21 PM] dimxy#2587
I was able to rekt with negative leverage -777 for BTS_USD (at it was growing  yesterday)


[02-May-19 11:26 PM] TonyL#3577
It looks like I'm super lucky because my costbasis is 5402 and LiquidationPrice just 7 dollars beyond


[02-May-19 11:27 PM] TonyL#3577
It's just a miracle to not touch this mark


[02-May-19 11:40 PM] dimxy#2587
for leverage 777 it is okay, isn't it?


[02-May-19 11:57 PM] TonyL#3577
This spread between costbasis and LiquidationPrice is fine for sure


[03-May-19 12:02 AM] TonyL#3577
Just in average somewhere around 776 bets from 777 should be rekt 😂


[03-May-19 02:29 AM] TonyL#3577
@dimxy Tried simple multistack synthetic price: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/TSVJbpv59Z/ (I just copypasted same stack 8 times)
Expected ~400k * 8 (400k + 400k + 400k ...) but it looks like price calculated as one stack price only


[03-May-19 02:32 AM] dimxy#2587
okay, checking...


[03-May-19 02:40 AM] dimxy#2587
I believe this is by design  as synthetic  price is actually a weighed  index: 
```(price1 * weight1  + price2* weight2 +...) / (weight1+weight2+...)```


[03-May-19 02:48 AM] TonyL#3577
1*A + 1*A + 1*A + 1*A + 1*A + 1*A + 1*A + 1*A = 8*A  I wonder


[03-May-19 02:49 AM] TonyL#3577
Ah if indexes normalized on 1 each is 1/8


[03-May-19 02:49 AM] jl777c#5810
8*A/8


[03-May-19 02:50 AM] TonyL#3577
My bad, sry


[03-May-19 02:50 AM] TonyL#3577
So it seems to work correct 😃


[07-May-19 12:11 AM] dimxy#2587
Now we need to implement  some risk management strategy to prevent bankruptcy.
Do we have a technique in mind?
should we for example calculate probabilistic data, like expected values to take into account?


[07-May-19 12:24 AM] TonyL#3577
I think for now we can take some number just from head and then calibrate (start from assumtion that on range contract "playing" 50/50 with players) and not accept bet if winnings exceed 1% of CC bankroll


[07-May-19 12:24 AM] TonyL#3577
Also not accept new bets maybe if active ones cannot be settled with current bankroll and such assumption


[07-May-19 12:26 AM] TonyL#3577
So in case of 50/50 desired formula is `bet_expected_value = bet_amount * loss_probability + bet_amount * won_probability = bet_amount * 0.5 + bet_amount * 0.5 = bet_amount`


[07-May-19 12:28 AM] TonyL#3577
But not sure how it's possible to prevent creation of 100 same bets of 1% in same block


[07-May-19 12:30 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe more cunning mechanism is needed - like a deviding/spread of CC bankroll between different markets 
Lets say 25% of CC bankroll can be used on cryptomarkets bets only, 25% on forex pairs, 25% on stocks, 25% on combined - something like that


[07-May-19 12:35 AM] TonyL#3577
Player with enough bankroll can drain now whole CC bankroll by one bet if he is lucky enough (or have some additional insider information / advantage over the house)
Thinking on very hypotetical situations when in CC bankroll few million USD lets say and to manipulate market 10000 USD needed for example


[07-May-19 12:35 AM] TonyL#3577
So one such "attack" on some low liquidity pair will drain whole bankroll


[07-May-19 12:36 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems needed to only allow betting on high liquidity pairs


[07-May-19 12:36 AM] jl777c#5810
or limit leverage to very small amount for low liquidity


[07-May-19 12:36 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe separate tiers


[07-May-19 12:37 AM] TonyL#3577
First tier markets - bankroll in game 100x, second tier markets - bankroll in game 1x


[07-May-19 12:37 AM] TonyL#3577
Tier depends of volumes


[07-May-19 12:37 AM] jl777c#5810
for start maybe we just allow bets on first tier markets


[07-May-19 12:37 AM] jl777c#5810
we can then see how it actually works with real money at stake


[07-May-19 12:38 AM] TonyL#3577
Thats what bookmakers do actually - on NBA match I can bet 100k USD without problems because it's deeply analyzed and hardly to maniplulate (buy match lets say) but on some low league in same bookmaker my limit can be 100 usd


[07-May-19 12:38 AM] jl777c#5810
then iterate, adding lower and lower volume things as we see how things work


[07-May-19 12:39 AM] jl777c#5810
so globally, if we have the total exposure calculation, we can scale the maxbet/leverage allowed based on that and the tier of the synthetic, initially only dealing with first tiers to simplify


[07-May-19 12:40 AM] TonyL#3577
Problem is that in "centralized" world KYC handling this maxbet issue - security depts trying to make process of multiaccounting as hard as possible but in such decentralized thing if you want to place `100x * maxbet` you just need script which create 100 wallets


[07-May-19 12:42 AM] TonyL#3577
It's super intetesting what happens when real money will be at stake


[07-May-19 12:52 AM] dimxy#2587
so the simplest case is to calculate the current volume for  this kind of synthetic (and maybe totally for those pairs which form the synthetic) and allow a bet for no more than for example 1% from it. 
Plus we need a way to define  tiers (it is some amount scale hard coded in the cc)


[07-May-19 12:56 AM] jl777c#5810
what you can do is cancel out all the positive vs negative positions for each coin


[07-May-19 12:56 AM] jl777c#5810
the net exposure is the sum of exposure of each coin


[07-May-19 12:56 AM] jl777c#5810
meaning, a long XYZ/BTC vs short ZBC/BTC cancel out


[07-May-19 12:57 AM] jl777c#5810
also long ZYX/BTC and long BTC/ABC also cancel out the BTC exposure


[07-May-19 12:57 AM] jl777c#5810
we would need to have a requirement that all bets must be for a A/B synthetic


[07-May-19 12:58 AM] jl777c#5810
then this net balancing can be done and typically a good percentage of positions cancel out other positions


[07-May-19 01:32 AM] TonyL#3577
I tested some positons with different coeffetients multiply stacks - price looks believable. Just thinking maybe for debugging/testing it might be helpful to see somewhere intermediate calculations results (price of each stack, coeff for each stack)


[07-May-19 01:41 AM] dimxy#2587
yes I already output most if them, maybe should mark them better  in debug


[07-May-19 01:43 AM] jl777c#5810
this is idea based on what tony said to me


[07-May-19 01:43 AM] jl777c#5810
we can dramatically limit system risk, by selling the positions to other players


[07-May-19 01:44 AM] jl777c#5810
delta neutral portfolio is the balancing concept


[07-May-19 01:44 AM] jl777c#5810
a delta neutral portfolio doesnt care if the price goes up or down as all positions are hedged


[07-May-19 01:45 AM] jl777c#5810
of course we cant practically achieve 100% delta neutrality... however we can push things to come close to it


[07-May-19 01:45 AM] jl777c#5810
so, lets imagine we add the ability for all existing positions to have their opposite bet listed


[07-May-19 01:46 AM] jl777c#5810
covering the opposite position would be offered at some discount, or we charge a bigger premium to create an initial position


[07-May-19 01:47 AM] jl777c#5810
the house edge can simply be the 24hr min/max, so the initial position and covered position will have different costbasis and this difference is the house profit margin


[07-May-19 01:48 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe this allows us to offer covering an existing position without any fee


[07-May-19 01:48 AM] jl777c#5810
and we charge something like a 1% fee to create a new position


[07-May-19 01:49 AM] jl777c#5810
this then creates an "orderbook" of unbalanced bets that people can choose to make, it should be displayed in the reversed form so people can just see what bet they can make without a fee, they still need the deposit of course


[07-May-19 01:50 AM] jl777c#5810
a complication is that as funds are added, it seems such adding of funds creates the opposite orderbook entry for the amount of new funds


[07-May-19 01:51 AM] jl777c#5810
with this, we can see the total exposure is the sum of the unfilled "orderbook"


[07-May-19 01:51 AM] jl777c#5810
and that due to not needing a fee, people will naturally tend to balance the portfolio over creating a new position


[07-May-19 01:52 AM] jl777c#5810
with such a total exposure that is constantly reduced with the opposite orderbook, we can then cap the amount of new positions allowed, ie. once the max net exposure is reached, no new positions are allowed, only bets that reduce the exposure via opposite orderbook


[07-May-19 01:54 AM] jl777c#5810
please explore this avenue of a balancing opposite orderbook. make it 10x easier to balance an existing position that creating a new one, and more expensive too


[07-May-19 01:55 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL @dimxy does this make sense?


[07-May-19 01:56 AM] jl777c#5810
for example, creating a new position can be limited to 10x leverage, but that can be matched by a 100x leverage using 10% of funds. if it gets rekt, then the original amount is available for the opposite orderbook again


[07-May-19 01:56 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe 5x leverage is the max for creating a new position, not sure what is best


[07-May-19 01:57 AM] jl777c#5810
enough to offer a unique value, not too much so that the system gets capital. As soon as a position is fully balanced, then the system is guaranteed to gain some amount of winnings as both sides cannot win at the same time, one of them will usually get rekt or at least have balancing losses


[07-May-19 01:59 AM] jl777c#5810
this reduces the risk management problem (very hard in the abstract) to more of an incentivized ordermatching, which seems a lower degree of difficulty. for anything but the most common synthetic, we can even make the max leverage 1x


[07-May-19 01:59 AM] jl777c#5810
it would just be covered by the overall system capital as it grows


[07-May-19 01:59 AM] TonyL#3577
Have some crazy idea: what if to make positions as NFTs


[07-May-19 02:00 AM] jl777c#5810
aha! then whoever owns it needs to be the "house" for that position? but that would require to match the leverage exactly


[07-May-19 02:01 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems a needless complication, though the orderbook is automatically gained


[07-May-19 02:01 AM] jl777c#5810
for the BET sidechain, the BET fee address should be a snapshot payments CC script


[07-May-19 02:01 AM] TonyL#3577
I think it can open interesting possibilities because of native tokendex, and can collect fees on position withdraw to NFT and deposit from NFT


[07-May-19 02:02 AM] TonyL#3577
So like a inside of platform trading might be free


[07-May-19 02:02 AM] jl777c#5810
lets do NFT of positions later, the complexity of enforcing leverage, costbasis inside an NFT...


[07-May-19 02:02 AM] TonyL#3577
But if you want to trade on secondary market - you have to pay for position withdrawal into token


[07-May-19 02:02 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh yes sure, just a conceptual idea 😃


[07-May-19 02:02 AM] jl777c#5810
we want to incentivize trading on secondary market


[07-May-19 02:03 AM] jl777c#5810
any trade that lowers system risk is guaranteed profits


[07-May-19 02:07 AM] jl777c#5810
with the snapshot CC as the destination for fees, as you win your bets, you then get a bigger share of the overall trading fees


[07-May-19 02:08 AM] TonyL#3577
`BETS` coin have revenue share from sidechains trading CCs ?


[07-May-19 02:08 AM] jl777c#5810
the prices CC monetization is to go to a BET address, but that requires accumulating and distributing it out manually


[07-May-19 02:09 AM] jl777c#5810
by making a BET sidechain and then paying the BET monetization to the snapshot CC script, it automates the process


[07-May-19 02:09 AM] jl777c#5810
the more BET (sidechain) you have, the larger percentage of the revshare payments you get


[07-May-19 02:10 AM] jl777c#5810
totally blockchain enforced, from the creation of the BET fees to the airdropping of the collected revshares


[07-May-19 02:10 AM] jl777c#5810
BET might become the first actual DAO

[07-May-19 02:16 AM] TonyL#3577
`for example, creating a new position can be limited to 10x leverage, but that can be matched by a 100x leverage using 10% of funds. if it gets rekt, then the original amount is available for the opposite orderbook again` - such dynamic hedging definetly got sense


[07-May-19 02:19 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe we can start from simple thing first:  
some `marketstat` call which output bets directions (like a: market: BTC_USD,  total_longs: 100, total_shorts: 50, spread: -50)
So with such current spread it's possible to open longs with leverage only x5 or x10 lets say but shorts possible to open with leverage up to x100 (in sizes less than moving spread to another side)


[07-May-19 02:21 AM] jl777c#5810
to calculate system exposure the "opposite orderbook" must be calculated anyway


[07-May-19 02:21 AM] jl777c#5810
rpc calls can be made to display just the ones that match a specific synthetic


[07-May-19 02:21 AM] jl777c#5810
so it would be a matter to select an orderbook item, set leverage and fund it


[07-May-19 02:21 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, I'm just explaining on visible example because can't correctly explain what needs to be done on consensus level


[07-May-19 02:22 AM] jl777c#5810
for all bets, find ones without a balancing trade (maybe using baton) and add to opposite orderbook list (or just sum the relevant details)


[07-May-19 02:23 AM] jl777c#5810
from the rpc side, you just need to get a list of available things to match


[07-May-19 02:23 AM] jl777c#5810
and a way to match an orderbook item with a specified leverage


[07-May-19 02:25 AM] jl777c#5810
other than changing max leverage allowed and linking balancing bets, it seems not so much change on the consensus side


[07-May-19 02:25 AM] jl777c#5810
and this avoids having to make many iterations on risk management


[07-May-19 02:25 AM] jl777c#5810
decentralize the risk


[07-May-19 02:25 AM] jl777c#5810
so the system does its best to minimize the net exposure


[07-May-19 02:26 AM] TonyL#3577
But from risk side: 500 with x1 leverage as I see is almost the same as 5 with x100 leverage (500 vs 500). Why we cant just summarize longs and shorts risk amount (bet amonut * leverage) on market and stimulate equalizing?


[07-May-19 02:26 AM] jl777c#5810
and this net exposure is limited to some sane maximum based on system capital


[07-May-19 02:27 AM] TonyL#3577
Balance each positon is complicated but balance whole market should be positions_amount easier


[07-May-19 02:27 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, ultimately that is what the system does, but we have specific utxo and not a balance based system, so how would you deal with 1000 bets made in mempool?


[07-May-19 02:27 AM] jl777c#5810
i disagree


[07-May-19 02:27 AM] jl777c#5810
i think balancing each position is much simpler


[07-May-19 02:27 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe more complex for GUI


[07-May-19 02:27 AM] jl777c#5810
but GUI can treat the possible bets as "utxo" and present a balance based display


[07-May-19 02:28 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe if we change the entire internals to be oriented toward a specific synthetic and all its positions, a balance based method makes sense


[07-May-19 02:28 AM] jl777c#5810
so this is more an implementation question than a design


[07-May-19 02:29 AM] jl777c#5810
the goal is clear, decentralize the risk exposure by incentivizing opposite positions

{Reactions}
👍 

[07-May-19 02:29 AM] jl777c#5810
and yes, the display to user can simply show the max leverage allowed for a synthetic, will be different for long maxleverage and short maxleverage


[07-May-19 02:30 AM] TonyL#3577
Yep that what my thought - for GUI it might be complicated to show "unbalanced" positions with offer to balance in case of endless markets amount


[07-May-19 02:30 AM] jl777c#5810
based on amount bet, N total bets can be made that add up to the desired exposure


[07-May-19 02:31 AM] TonyL#3577
So in GUI might be abstracted just to leverage allowed to choose, yep just implementation question


[07-May-19 02:31 AM] jl777c#5810
it could be that 20% of the bets cant be made due to someone else getting the baton


[07-May-19 02:32 AM] jl777c#5810
so the GUI should show a maximum amount that wants to be bet at the specified leverage, and then it shows how much actually was able to be submitted to mempool (and then confirmed)


[07-May-19 02:32 AM] TonyL#3577
GUI should be quite clever this time hehe


[07-May-19 02:36 AM] jl777c#5810
i think we can name the BET sidechain BETS, so for testing the first one can be BETS0


[07-May-19 02:37 AM] jl777c#5810
make it so it can do the snapshot payments CC using some reasonable amount of accumulated profits, blackjok8r is the one to ask on how to set it up


[07-May-19 02:38 AM] jl777c#5810
i have a feeling there will be some sidechain specific issues, and maybe snapshot issues too. we can do a single node gateways CC for BETS0


[07-May-19 02:39 AM] jl777c#5810
let me know when it is setup and I can fund it with some BET


[07-May-19 02:41 AM] TonyL#3577
Ok, will wrap head a little over paymentsCC, consult with jok3r and go ahead 👍


[07-May-19 02:43 AM] jl777c#5810
since it will be based on BET fees, it doesnt need to do the bootstrapping, well other than getting the right CC vout to hardcode the BET fees to


[07-May-19 02:45 AM] Deleted User#0000
payments seems to be keeping consensus in my game so far. I'm not 100% sure merge RPC stuff is perfectly stable. Need to get a chain up for Alright to test that, however fo test chain, we should just use it and see if any bugs arise.


[07-May-19 02:46 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, BETS0 is just a test chain, dimxy will need the scriptPubKey that sends to a snapshot CC, maybe we need to make a tx with opret first and then update the prices CC, not sure

{Reactions}
👌 

[07-May-19 02:47 AM] dimxy#2587
I think I get the whole idea that we introduce an opposite position and stimulate to use it to get the fund balanced. More details will be discovered while implementing.  I think probably we  might need to calculate the balance for every block (otherwise it is going to be too many calculations for a single rpc call)

yes, balance needs to be calculated every block


[07-May-19 02:48 AM] jl777c#5810
but that can be cached locally, i dont think it needs to be in consensus


[07-May-19 02:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
I already know how to implement tracking of top 3999 address, such that the last notarized height the balance fo the top 3999 addresses is known. Also it will be possible to know the live balance of each top 3999 address at each block, but basing tx conensus on this leaves possibility of tx not being mined in the enxt exact block and such would become invalid if the balance changed before it was mined.

snapshots can just be paid out max daily, likely not even monthly as it is only for the BET fees


[07-May-19 02:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
I have not actaully tried to implement this yet, as the snapshot is working perfectly as it is, just a little slow for chain syncs when chain gets longer.


[07-May-19 03:40 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c Just to be sure if I understood idea correct: should be part of `BETS0` pricesCC revenue  distributed on main `BET` chain between `BET` coin holders or on `BETS0` ?

So scheme is something like this: "buffer" wallet A accumulating fees, then each let's say 6 hours 20% of fees airdropping to holders of (not sure what exactly), another 80% sendning to pricesCC address which covers payouts for bets.

If setup `BET` <- `BETS0` 1:1 gateway I think that I have to set extra low mining rewards on `BETS0` and this chain should be notarised


[07-May-19 03:41 AM] jl777c#5810
no


[07-May-19 03:41 AM] jl777c#5810
BETS0 is a BET sidechain


[07-May-19 03:41 AM] jl777c#5810
that is the only direct connection to BET


[07-May-19 03:41 AM] jl777c#5810
prices CC fees goes to a snapshot CC address


[07-May-19 03:42 AM] jl777c#5810
anybody can then trigger a 100% payout to BET0 holders in proportion, ie. airdrop of the accumulated fees


[07-May-19 03:42 AM] jl777c#5810
all sidechains need to have a low mining reward that is fully covered by external subsidies


[07-May-19 03:43 AM] jl777c#5810
and it should be notarized, but we can live without it while testing


[07-May-19 03:43 AM] jl777c#5810
people use prices CC, snapshot address accumulates fees, anyone can trigger an airdrop in propoprtion to BETS0 held in normal address


[07-May-19 03:44 AM] jl777c#5810
the idea is for BETS0 chain to attract BET deposits into BETS0 to collect the revshares


[07-May-19 03:45 AM] Deleted User#0000
ok so you can send BET to the BETS0 chain, and the amount held there determines the proportions of who is paid.


[07-May-19 03:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
so the BET chain istelf, has nothing much to do with it, apart from being the source of the funds?


[07-May-19 03:46 AM] jl777c#5810
its only purpose is to have external value in the BETS0 chain


[07-May-19 03:46 AM] jl777c#5810
each BET is worth a few dollars


[07-May-19 03:47 AM] jl777c#5810
so this automatically creates a bounty system to find bugs or just earn money betting


[07-May-19 03:47 AM] jl777c#5810
not to mention create one of the first ever fully functioning DAO


[07-May-19 03:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think I understand this now, should work with existing paymetns plan, although we may need to use 2 plans, to distribute the 20/80 revenue first, so the 20% goes to airdrop payments plan, and the otehr 80% can go back where its uspposed to be.


[07-May-19 03:47 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no 20/80


[07-May-19 03:48 AM] jl777c#5810
100% goes to snapshot, tony was just confused

[07-May-19 03:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
so we need a verushash11 chain with low block rewards with a payments plan created, then the pricessCC will need to pay its fees to the txidpk address.


[07-May-19 03:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think this covers it ?


[07-May-19 03:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
if pricesCC fees are hardcoded in source no earlytxid is needed, that is for address to pay to.


[07-May-19 03:50 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems so


[07-May-19 03:50 AM] jl777c#5810
will need to bootstrap just the BET fee scriptPubKey, but that wont affect chain creation


[07-May-19 03:51 AM] jl777c#5810
or with the extra data, maybe we cam know the exact scriptPubKey ahead of time


[07-May-19 03:52 AM] Deleted User#0000
currently the txidpk address does nto use an op_return or ccvout... but if you can create this address before starting the pricessCC, either hardcode this address in pricessCC code, OR use earlytxid to define the address.


[07-May-19 03:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
`./komodod -ac_name=BETS0 -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=10000 -ac_cc=2 -ac_algo=verushash11 -ac_snapshot=1440 ` @TonyL  something like this will work pretty well I think.


[07-May-19 03:59 AM] TonyL#3577
Thanks @Deleted User Is ac_snapshot period in minutes of how often it be claimed or?


[07-May-19 04:02 AM] Deleted User#0000
an_snapshot is required to use payments Airdropp... 1440 means 1440 blocks (24H) a snapshot of the chain is made, this is valid for 24H until the next once happens, any paymentsrelease issued between this range will use the saved balances at that height. It was very tricky to get paymetns airdrop to reach consenus. Currently doing it more than once a day will be just too slow. I know how to fix this, at least at a conceptual level, but I have not implemented it at this stage as this solution seems very stable even if its a little slow.


[07-May-19 04:02 AM] jl777c#5810
this is perfectly fine

[07-May-19 04:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
One thing that needs to be checked is that the address balances saved are actually correct 😉 It has to rewind blocks back tothe last notarized height (or 100 blocks)


[07-May-19 04:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think I can do this by just using -stopat on the payments game chain. Will trey to do this tomorrow.


[07-May-19 04:10 AM] jl777c#5810
it could be months before there are enough revshare accumulated to warrant a payment release, so daily granularity is no problem at all


[07-May-19 04:16 AM] TonyL#3577
After jok3r explanation I wonder that before start sidechain chain pricesCC should be able to send fees to address from `earlytxid` param


[07-May-19 04:16 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no need for earlytxid


[07-May-19 04:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
doing it longer than 1 day is also problematic, as it has to rewind back to the last snapshot height every daemon start, and doing that for thousands and tousands of blocks will take a long time.


[07-May-19 04:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think that we do need it, because we need he scriptpubkey to pay to, and plan must be created for that fisrt.


[07-May-19 04:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
regardless if you use txidpk address or global address you still need the plan creation txid


[07-May-19 04:18 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, ok, i guess we need some detailed step by step

maybe something in validation, to amke sure people cannot start a chain with a diffrent or no -earlytxid and then pay something else.


[07-May-19 09:45 PM] TonyL#3577
So I wonder we need help of @dimxy with hardcoding of address from -earlytxid usage as an address for fees to start a such chain


[07-May-19 10:27 PM] dimxy#2587
seems I had the address for this


[07-May-19 10:29 PM] jl777c#5810
the payout address needs to be to a special CC vout that does snapshots


[07-May-19 10:59 PM] jl777c#5810
payments sent to that address would only be released as a snapshot airdrop


[07-May-19 10:59 PM] jl777c#5810
since it will be a sidechain of BET, (assuming all BET coins are in the sidechain) it acts like sending to BET address and distributing from there


[07-May-19 11:00 PM] jl777c#5810
i expect there will be different BET sidechains, so in a way the BET hodler would bet on which sidechain has the best revshares


[07-May-19 11:00 PM] dimxy#2587
what 's the special vout structure?


[07-May-19 11:00 PM] jl777c#5810
for non-side chains, it would be sent to a normal address


[07-May-19 11:00 PM] jl777c#5810
you need to get the exact scriptPubKey from blockjok8r


[07-May-19 11:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
it is created by making th payment plan, then funded with payments fund. It has no op_return. 
```txidpk = CCtxidaddr(txidaddr,txid);
mtx.vout.push_back(MakeCC1of2vout(EVAL_PAYMENTS,amount,Paymentspk,txidpk));```
You need to create the payments plan First, so you have the txid. this txid could be supplied by an op_return with `-earlytxid` or you can make payments plan, then hardcode the txid in the daemon.


[07-May-19 11:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
any payments ccvout in that address can be spent by paymentsrelease


[07-May-19 11:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
Alternativly you can pay it to global paymentsCC address with a ccopret or opreturn. But I think in this case its not required to do that, only adds extra complexity


[07-May-19 11:17 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont want to hardcode txid in the daemon, it needs to automaticall switch between payout to snapshot for BET sidechain or to normal BET address in other case


[07-May-19 11:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
If showen where in pricessCC it is amking this payment I can add it if required, using -earlytxid.


[07-May-19 11:27 PM] jl777c#5810
I think the prices CC code just needs to look for -earlytxid if it exists and if it is sidechain then send to payments CC scriptPubKey


[07-May-19 11:28 PM] jl777c#5810
else send to BET address


[07-May-19 11:28 PM] dimxy#2587
is it 0,5% of bet amout?


[07-May-19 11:28 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, that sounds good


[07-May-19 11:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
How i did it for appendACscript was ther first time it is needed by validation, lookup the earlytxid op_return and save it to a static variable.


[07-May-19 11:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
pretty sure it must be in validation code, otherwise its not consensus and people will be able to change it


[07-May-19 11:37 PM] jl777c#5810
yes it is in the validation code, of course


[07-May-19 11:37 PM] jl777c#5810
just not the specific txid


[07-May-19 11:37 PM] jl777c#5810
usage of the EARLYTXID variable is done and further it needs to make sure it is within first 100 blocks of chain and a valid txid to use for the intended purpose


[07-May-19 11:38 PM] jl777c#5810
but this can be coded once for all the usages of earlytxid based plans


[07-May-19 11:38 PM] jl777c#5810
we might need another param to differentiate between different usages


[07-May-19 11:38 PM] jl777c#5810
or maybe it is encoded in the scriptPubKey


[07-May-19 11:39 PM] jl777c#5810
its ok to be updating the validation code once, but not for each and every different txid


[09-May-19 12:46 AM] dimxy#2587
as I understand we need to start a new prices cc chain to make earlytxid work


[09-May-19 12:54 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is for bootstrapping a new chain


[09-May-19 12:54 AM] jl777c#5810
so it can have the validations all active too

I haven't merged some fix for earlytxid to FSM yet..

 ASSETCHAINS_EARLYTXIDCONTRACT = GetArg("-ac_earlytxidcontract",0);
fprintf(stderr, "ASSETCHAINS_EARLYTXIDCONTRACT.%i\n", ASSETCHAINS_EARLYTXIDCONTRACT);```

[09-May-19 12:57 AM] Deleted User#0000
Why ?


[09-May-19 12:59 AM] Mihailo#5902
As ac params should affect magiccalc and this is added later when chain is already created so it should be regular param. I think JL mentioned it like that.


[09-May-19 12:59 AM] Mihailo#5902
I've made it like this:
```cpp
KOMODO_EARLYTXID = Parseuint256(GetArg("-earlytxid","0").c_str());
    if (KOMODO_EARLYTXID!=zeroid && (tx_height(KOMODO_EARLYTXID)==0 || tx_height(KOMODO_EARLYTXID)>100))
    {
        fprintf(stderr,"earlytx can be only in first 100 blocks or does not exist\n");
        StartShutdown();
    }```


[09-May-19 01:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
no, incorrect. This needs to be magic value, becuase it defines what contract the earlytxid script pubkey is used by... If iot did not affect magic people can just chagne the contract eval code and pay to diffrent contracts.


[09-May-19 01:01 AM] Mihailo#5902
Oh, maybe I misunderstood EARLYTXIDCONTRACT


[09-May-19 01:01 AM] Deleted User#0000
As earlytxid was already there, I just used it as it was. I guess with that check on daemon load, some of my code can be remvoed, but thats isnt not a big deal, we can sort it out.


[09-May-19 01:01 AM] Mihailo#5902
EARLYTXID should just contain the txid of valid CC create tx.

This is used to strore the scriptPukKey the contract/ac_script pays to. 
There are 2 ways its currently used, it can take an op_return for a contract and append that to the CCvout, so that coinbase cna pay a contract with ac_script, earlytxid appends extra data from the op_return to the ac_script.
Allowing coinbase to fund a contract. Also added yesterday for prices/payments to work together, we can make payments plan before block 100, extract the scriptpubkey that allows it to be paid, and then another contract can use thisscriptpubkey to fund the paymetns plan. Should also work for any contract.


[09-May-19 01:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
In short, coinbase pays a contract, and a contract can pay a contract. But its limited basically to a special chain. You cant create contracts that fund each other on a chain that already exists.

yes by using the `-ac_earlytxidcontract=237` the chain knows that the scriptpubkey inside the earlytxid, is to be used to pay something from the pricesCC.


[09-May-19 01:14 AM] Deleted User#0000
working out teh parameters for the paymentsairdrop is liekly the hardest aprt really. They need to be sane so that the contract will function with the amounts it wil be receiving, how many address it wil be paying etc. An address cannot receive less than 10k sats. So if the plan is designed incirrectly, it could take years, before a release is possible.

Am I missing something or some min blocks amount should pass until other two prices will be calculated? (using latest jl777)


[09-May-19 11:03 PM] jl777c#5810
is it printing out all the prices it is getting?

[10-May-19 12:07 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm, 130 blocks already and still single price. How much data approx it needs to calculate others?


[10-May-19 12:16 AM] TonyL#3577
Tried to delete blocks on one node and resync - now on `./komodo-cli -ac_name=TONYPS2 prices 1` daemon crashing with such backtrace: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/GNxpGnwyJK/


[10-May-19 12:18 AM] TonyL#3577
Ah, blocks not syncing thats why it's crashing. With synced chain prices works fine - just still have single price


[10-May-19 03:21 AM] TonyL#3577
`  "height": 330,`
single price still so maybe clue in something different.
Btw this chain I started with default blocktime vs REKT0 `-ac_blocktime=600` (not sure but maybe its reflecting in these prices calculation)


[10-May-19 06:06 AM] jl777c#5810
how many blocks in a day?


[10-May-19 06:06 AM] jl777c#5810
until then the prices wont be all there

1 minute blocks, so should be around 1440 blocks in a day. Ah it delayed 24 hours, so have to wait 24 hours, I see


[10-May-19 06:40 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe it is worth to have some prices chain test mode? Make delay for test chains 30 minutes lets say so will able to test chains faster.
Because if now I did something wrong with earlytxid on chain setup or want to test chain with stocks param I have to wait 24 hours to accumulate prices what looks like not very effective way to test on this point.

I added a check for acceptable amount, by finding opposite positions like BTC_USD to BTC_USD,!  
Actually I'm checking sum(leverage\*amount) for both up-positions and down-positions. If amount could be fit to balance this is okay to add the bet. (I'm checking this only for simple positions)
if it is not fit to the balance of opposites I check if the bet's leverage*amount  <  10% from free totalfund (that is  collected from fees and rekt positions). 
So we need some initial fund to start accept bets


[10-May-19 08:50 AM] dimxy#2587
there is a new pricesgetorderbook rpc that outputs matched posiitons and  their balances and total fund's amounts


[10-May-19 09:19 AM] TonyL#3577
Great, updating 🔥 
` from free totalfund (that is  collected from fees and rekt positions). ` are rekt positions and fees the same funds at the moment? (we need to airdrop by paymentsCC only fees as I understand)


[10-May-19 10:01 AM] jl777c#5810
you can start with some minimum acceptable risk in a #define, then bets can start. of course we need to seed it with some real funds before sizeable betting can happen

{Reactions}
👌 

[10-May-19 11:42 AM] dimxy#2587
yes  rekt and fees  are printed as one amount 'TotalFund' like this is fund's own  free money.
Oh, no sorry, TotalFund  is all available amount on global pricespk address.  TotalRekt - what was rekt ,TotalBets - amount on all bets not rekt or cashed out.
So fees are somewhere  within (TotalFunds - TotalRekt - TotalBets)


[10-May-19 09:14 PM] TonyL#3577
Got such prints on REKT0 sync atm:
```PricesValidate() ValidateBetTx=false the fee was paid to wrong address.

```I added a check for acceptable amount, by finding opposite positions like BTC_USD to BTC_USD,!```
Btw BTC_USD to BTC_USD,! just one of the cases of opossite positions. More common case of opossite positions should be:
 BTC_USD, minus some leverage  vs. BTC_USD plus some leverage

In general can't imagine situations where `!` sign is very needed because change leverage sign should do the same job (when you short BTC_USD it's the same as long USD_BTC)

@TonyL  ```More common case of opossite positions should be:

Yes, I believe I cover this, because I sort  out up and down positions  and calculate thier balance as 'levegared position' that is  sum(positionUp*leverage). Not sure this quite correct just what I worked out

if isUpPosition should display if it long or short - it should be 1 because it is long and for KMD_BTC, ! it should be 0 because it's KMD_BTC short (so vice versa to current displaying for this pair)

@dimxy great!

 I'm a little bit (actually much) confused with current quest of chain creation with fees airdrop to holders. It looks like @Deleted User implemented mechanism to airdrop some funds from pricesCC - but  I'm not sure if it fees or not, and wasn't able to test it yet because have no luck with new chain starting. We have to airdrop only fees but not rekt funds

Also could you please advice how / in which place of pricesCC code I can change delay in prices forming for testing purposes? (for these airdrops testing I want to make test chain on which second and third price will appear faster than in 24 hours)

Actually I do not know much about airdrop yet. I know that I need to add a special vout to pair a fraction of fee to some script.
For 24 hour cycle  a PRICES_DAYWINDOW #define is responsible


[12-May-19 01:09 AM] TonyL#3577
Ah I see, will wait your review / adjustments to go ahead with this airdrop testing so. I thought you communicated with jok3r on this matter because he PR'ed to your repo 😃 

`For 24 hour cycle  a PRICES_DAYWINDOW #define is responsible` - hmm I've started chain with daemons both precompiled with DTESTMODE flag (thought it will make PRICES_DAYWINDOW = 7) but had only single price


[12-May-19 01:09 AM] TonyL#3577

[12-May-19 01:16 AM] dimxy#2587
TESTMODE now only changes the costbasis detection period (I switched to this as you once noted your chart showed incorrect period in the TESTMODE)
So you need to change PRICES_DAYWINDOW itself too to have shorter period

[12-May-19 01:18 AM] dimxy#2587
I added joker's code for paying out fee but did not enable it yet as I understand we need to switch to a new chain for it to work


[12-May-19 01:21 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe it makes sense to start a chain and have the fees going to a hardcoded address


[12-May-19 01:21 AM] jl777c#5810
that way the fees are easy to understand and can be debugge


[12-May-19 01:21 AM] jl777c#5810
once it is debugged, just change the destination of the fee to the snapshot CC scriptPubKey


[12-May-19 01:24 AM] jl777c#5810
as long as the chain is setup properly, it wont need a new chain to switch the fee destination

just dont enforce validation for the fee until it is all understood


[12-May-19 01:24 AM] jl777c#5810
to understand the snapshot payment CC, imagine a CC where you can specify that all funds to an address are only distributed as an airdrop based on coin balance


[12-May-19 01:25 AM] jl777c#5810
any funds send to the snapshot address, accumulates until an airdrop is triggered


[12-May-19 01:25 AM] jl777c#5810
getting it setup properly requires a few tricks


[12-May-19 01:29 AM] TonyL#3577
I think (or at least hope 😃 ) that I setup correct chain with such earlytxid and payment plan (got prints that snapshot made). Just need a connection with pricesCC now


[12-May-19 01:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yes, payments cc has an address that is calculated from the creation txid. All u need to do is send payments cc vout to this address. Once enough funds arrive you can release it and it makes a tx with up to 3999 recipients


[12-May-19 01:30 AM] jl777c#5810
it checks for dust limits?


[12-May-19 01:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
Your can't release a payment if any recipient gets less than 10k SATs, this can be raised. There is no need for inputs.check because you can do payments merge


[12-May-19 01:33 AM] jl777c#5810
would that allow a dust attack?


[12-May-19 01:33 AM] jl777c#5810
make an address with very few coins so it would end up less than 10k sats revshare


[12-May-19 01:33 AM] jl777c#5810
then it stops all payouts?


[12-May-19 01:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
That's up to the plans designer of who to pay ... If u design a plan that can't be paid coins burnt I guess


[12-May-19 01:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
You can merge any inputs as long as.its not all dust


[12-May-19 01:35 AM] jl777c#5810
can you set a dust threshold for output


[12-May-19 01:35 AM] jl777c#5810
so anybody that would get less than the dust threshold is skipped


[12-May-19 01:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
Its 10k sat


[12-May-19 01:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
You cana already raise it


[12-May-19 01:35 AM] jl777c#5810
it sounds like the entire airdrop is stopped if a single payout address goes below 10k sats?


[12-May-19 01:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yes currently


[12-May-19 01:36 AM] jl777c#5810
its wrong


[12-May-19 01:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
It would fail


[12-May-19 01:36 AM] jl777c#5810
so I make an address with 1000 sats in it


[12-May-19 01:36 AM] jl777c#5810
as a share of overall snapshot, it will be very small


[12-May-19 01:36 AM] jl777c#5810
and basically make the minimum airdrop size very big


[12-May-19 01:37 AM] jl777c#5810
in fact it might need to be 10x the coin supply


[12-May-19 01:37 AM] jl777c#5810
you see the problem?


[12-May-19 01:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think maybe we are talking about something else... I'm talking who can be paid... The amount paid. Your talking about a minimum balance needed to get an allocation?


[12-May-19 01:37 AM] jl777c#5810
lets say we have 100 coins to be airdropped to 100 addresses


[12-May-19 01:38 AM] jl777c#5810
but the smallest addresses dont get more than 0.0001


[12-May-19 01:38 AM] jl777c#5810
this airdrop is not possible


[12-May-19 01:38 AM] jl777c#5810
why not just skip addresses that dont get 0.0001 ?


[12-May-19 01:39 AM] jl777c#5810
the way it is most all airdrops can be prevented just be creating an address with a small amount in it


[12-May-19 01:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
Seems easy enough


[12-May-19 01:40 AM] jl777c#5810
the "attack" would be frequent airdrops of small amounts to make the smaller coins not get anything, but that can be prevented by making the minimum total airdrop big enough


[12-May-19 01:40 AM] jl777c#5810
so it is much better to skip


[12-May-19 11:17 PM] dimxy#2587
I added a test vout with some fixed address where 0.5% fee is sent.
Also I added a check that this vout  should have not less than 10000 sat.


[12-May-19 11:17 PM] jl777c#5810
ok


[12-May-19 11:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
the input amount can be any amount... Im still trying to work out how to enforce minimum pay out... IMO just wait until there is enough funds in it to release


[12-May-19 11:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
Seems to need to rewriere entire validation to acheive this condition...


[12-May-19 11:59 PM] TonyL#3577
@dimxy Is there mechanism already to set this fixed address?


[13-May-19 12:01 AM] Deleted User#0000
Why need fixed address, I already added the paymentsCC address mechanisim... Its nto very complicated. What we need is a minimum release somehow so small amounts of funds can be released. Doyou need help to set this up?


[13-May-19 12:02 AM] Deleted User#0000
Im thinking just some exemption maybe soi that smaller amounts can be released or something... Its simply not possible to shorten the list of address that is paid.


[13-May-19 12:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think I can truncate the tx, but the total allocation would still include all elegible address


[13-May-19 12:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
So its not optimal at all.


[13-May-19 12:25 AM] dimxy#2587
well I just set it in the code as hex pubkey. Do we need it to be parametrized?


[13-May-19 12:27 AM] dimxy#2587
if we need some specific address - let's set it instead
@TonyL  This address is supposed just for testing. 
As we are ready to switch to a new chain I enable the code from blackjok which sends fee to the KOMODO_EARLYTXID_SCRIPTPUB


[13-May-19 12:45 AM] dimxy#2587
@Deleted User  Are you saying that I do not need to check the amount on the vout for payment cc? So it could be any amount on it even small?


[13-May-19 12:45 AM] Deleted User#0000
I already added all this


[13-May-19 12:45 AM] Deleted User#0000
The inputs can be merged.


[13-May-19 12:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
its the utputs that james has the issue with... I see only one simple solution, and I dont really think its very fair as such... although how liley will it be that under 10ksat is paid... if the plan has a sane minimum release it will be fine.


[13-May-19 12:47 AM] dimxy#2587
@Deleted User I set the fixed address as it was suggested just for testing before switching to a new chain


[13-May-19 12:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yes I added all the stuff for new chain. I thaught one had been started. sorry not been avalible much last few days to keep up.


[13-May-19 12:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
it simply takes a scriptpubkey, so for testing you arte hard coding a scriptpubkey that is fine, as long as what I added is actually working... as I didnt test it with a real chain because hte pricessCC wasnt finsihed for it at the time.


[13-May-19 12:51 AM] Deleted User#0000
Ive fixed a few bugs with paymentsCC, and I guess I need to add this trunctation of the tx in the RPC... I assume this will work, although its not a very nice solution it should at least work.

pricesbet: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/j3Rc8ppc5g/
pricesaddfunding: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/9RZYyjzXSK/

Both have 0.5% output to RAvTXi4GRktCdudNsB2ocFLEyvyoWJ4ty6

Is this print:
```PricesValidate() ValidateAddFundingTx = false invalid position size in the opreturn
PricesValidate() funcId=A ValidatebetTx = false incorrect vout number for bet tx```
on pricesaddfunding broadcasting expected? @dimxy


[13-May-19 11:56 PM] dimxy#2587
This could be because as I added payment cc vout so some older bet tx could not be validated.
That is, when an addfunding tx is added I do step back and validate the initial bettx too
(because initial bet tx has no cc vin I think I should validate it this way, that is, after some new tx with cc vins like addfunding tx is added)

they are all in komodo_gateway.h (can find by "http", some are commented out)

I am receiving many errors on my new prices chain:
"CheckTransaction(): invalid script data for coinbase time lock"
(maybe this is because I set ac_blocktime=60?)


[15-May-19 02:21 AM] TonyL#3577
I've started such chain:
```./komodod -ac_name=PRICEST -ac_cc=2 -ac_supply=100000000 -ac_reward=1000000000 -ac_cbopret=7 -ac_prices="LTC, BCHABC, XMR, IOTA, ZEC, WAVES, LSK, DCR, RVN, DASH, XEM, BTS, ICX, HOT, STEEM, ENJ, STRAT" -ac_stocks="AAPL, IBM, EA" -ac_snapshot=50 -ac_sapling=1 -ac_earlytxidcontract=237 -addnode=159.69.45.70 -pubkey=02147f20fbe0c3cc443cbded55a533bf2621a6efa0c089ac3b7a903f1d63f6690f -daemon
```
Then when I'm starting mining:
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=PRICEST setgenerate true 1``` daemon deadly hangs


[15-May-19 02:22 AM] TonyL#3577
Have modified PRICES_DAYWINDOW:
```-#define PRICES_DAYWINDOW ((3600*24/ASSETCHAINS_BLOCKTIME) + 1)
+#define PRICES_DAYWINDOW ((3600*1/ASSETCHAINS_BLOCKTIME) + 1)
```


[15-May-19 02:25 AM] dimxy#2587
what is your blocktime?


[15-May-19 02:25 AM] TonyL#3577
Should be default (1 min)


[15-May-19 02:26 AM] TonyL#3577
I expected window 61 (1 hour)


[15-May-19 02:27 AM] dimxy#2587
on REKT0 it was 600 (10min). I can see checks with 60sec constants - could be overlaps or so. I think I 'll recreate the chain with 120 or more


[15-May-19 02:28 AM] TonyL#3577
Will try now with default PRICES_DAYWINDOW


[15-May-19 02:32 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha, found the reason - it not because of `PRICES_DAYWINDOW` but because of `ac_stocks` param


[15-May-19 02:32 AM] TonyL#3577
With `-ac_stocks="AAPL, IBM, EA" ` daemon hangs right after I start mining, but without this param it works fine


[15-May-19 03:01 AM] dimxy#2587
we would need to wait for 2*PRICES_DAYWINDOW to begin to receive smoothed prices


[15-May-19 03:01 AM] dimxy#2587
so it seems better to set it to a lower value to test


[15-May-19 03:03 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, that was a plan


[15-May-19 03:03 AM] TonyL#3577
Now I'm started chain with such window: `#define PRICES_DAYWINDOW ((3600*1/ASSETCHAINS_BLOCKTIME) + 1)`


[15-May-19 03:04 AM] TonyL#3577
If it's `2*PIRCES_DAYWINDOW` it will take ~2 hours with default blocktime for smoothed prices


[15-May-19 03:14 AM] TonyL#3577
Started chain with such daywindow and earlytxid,  lets check if 3 prices propagate in 2 hours 😃

Ah, from other side player equity is the sum which fund needs to payout if player wants to cashout right now

we may change it of course

It's not a problem I think: if needed current fund equity can be calculated as `totalbets - players_equity (TotalEqutiy in this output)`

```if real funds summarising with equity...```
I did not find yet any methodology how real houses manage their funds. Very interesting to know about them.
I think we are similar to forex. So we could accept bets as long as there are balance with opposite positions (as we discussed). 
Sure real funds use more sophisticated technics than just funding "BTC_USD" vs "BTC_USD,!"

Just have read: some pairs might move in similar directions, in that case they are 'correlated pairs' like EUR/USD and GBP/USD. Correlation is measured with a coefficient.


[15-May-19 08:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
@TonyL  the funds are sending there correctly.. but they are in the wrong vout, so I need to fix this. Will have a look... It seems to me that I can loop each vout of the tx and check which ones are paymentscc vouts so it doesnt need vout 1 or 0 limitation.


[15-May-19 08:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
Pretty sure this is only RPC limitaiton

@Deleted User a little bit confused with `paymentsrelease` call

Have 156 egible funds in payments plan:
``` ./komodo-cli -ac_name=PRICEST1 paymentsinfo '["0deaa8d69fbea7cbaf85fbd1ace7e26c173b52e761cdf6edc3eecf04e1879e7f"]'

  "utxos": 0,
  "totalfunds": 161.00000000,
  "elegiblefunds": 156.00000000,
  "min_release_height": 510,
  "result": "success"
}
```

Trying to release 100:
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=PRICEST1 paymentsrelease "[%220deaa8d69fbea7cbaf85fbd1ace7e26c173b52e761cdf6edc3eecf04e1879e7f%22,100]"
{
  "result": "error",
  "error": "value too small, try releasing a larger amount, or use skipminimum flag"
}
```


[15-May-19 12:39 PM] TonyL#3577
But it looks like "amount to small" limitation determining by "minrelease" :
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=PRICEST1 paymentsrelease "
[%220deaa8d69fbea7cbaf85fbd1ace7e26c173b52e761cdf6edc3eecf04e1879e7f%22,1]"
{
  "result": "error",
  "error": "amount too smal",
  "amount": 1.00000000,
  "minrelease": 10.00000000
}
```


[15-May-19 12:40 PM] TonyL#3577
I thought that `"minimum": 10000` is some dust filter with default 10k satoshi - is it minimum funds amount on plan to execute release? (I'm on latest dimxy/prices-rpc and same chain as b4)

Payments CC RPCs
Payments CC RPCs  paymentstxidopret  ‘[allocation,”scriptPubKey”,(”destopret”)]’ Allocation is a number that defines how much to pay, using 50 and 50 for example would pay half the released amount to each address.  NOTE: this takes scriptpubleys NOT address’s.  ...

I guess I should just make skip minimum the default to avoid future confusion... but I dont really like it as if not enough is released it basically means only the largest whales get anything.


[16-May-19 12:50 AM] TonyL#3577
@Deleted User So should it be: ```paymentsrelease ‘[“createtxid”,amount,true]’ ``` ?


[16-May-19 12:52 AM] TonyL#3577
```Skipminimum is a flag, if there are address with such low balance minimumtoaddress cannot be paid, this will truncate the rich list off at the first address that is being paid the wrong amount. 
``` from description it looks like it's better to use this flag all the time

Or should `paymentsairdrop` call distribute tokens?


[16-May-19 01:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
Thwe problem is with it... if the minrelease has been set too small... Then it will simply always fail, as the amount paid si just dust. If you force skipminimum all the time, then it will alwyas work, but mostly it will only pay a copuple of the top address. I tested ths skipminimum thing and it works quite well, wasnt able to find a way to cheat it. I guess we can enforce it all the time, but that then forces the plan creator to make sane values.

Payments cc has been passed to gcharang and hopefully alright to test when he gets home. I'm 99% sure its good. I have confirmed snapshot height is correct and we ran chain with 20 nodes for 5 days, all seemed to agree on snapshot perfectly.


[16-May-19 01:28 AM] TonyL#3577
Great! Have to re-test `-ac_stocks` and can start 24 hours delay `BETS0` chain today I wonder


[16-May-19 02:24 AM] TonyL#3577
Is it possible to change `-ac_prices` and `-ac_stocks` parameters of chain "on fly" after chain creation or new chain needs to be created each time when you want to change these params?
Not totally understand how nodes come to consensus of which pairs are allowed to trade on this chain


[16-May-19 02:29 AM] jl777c#5810
they are ac parameters, to change it is to change the chain


[16-May-19 02:29 AM] jl777c#5810
choose wisely


[16-May-19 02:30 AM] jl777c#5810
there has to be a minimum payout, otherwise the largest address can attack by doing payments release at max frequency


[16-May-19 02:33 AM] TonyL#3577
There is a `"minrelease": 10.00000000` param of payment plan


[16-May-19 02:33 AM] TonyL#3577
Just hard to predict some fine values now because value/common denomination of BETS0 coin is unknown atm


[16-May-19 02:41 AM] TonyL#3577
I wonder on BETS0 we can test things and make estimates/notes for BETS1 
Since it will be chain with almost 0 emission all depends of BETS "mother" coin 😃


[16-May-19 02:47 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

`-ac_stocks` without space working fine


[16-May-19 04:22 AM] jl777c#5810
likely -ac_prices would too, so might be less confusing to never have space

funny idea


[16-May-19 05:04 AM] TonyL#3577
So proposed chain params are:
```./komodod -ac_name=BETS0 -ac_cbopret=7 -ac_cc=10777 -ac_reward=10000 -ac_supply=7777  -ac_blocktime=300 -ac_snapshot=288 -ac_sapling=1 -ac_earlytxidcontract=237
```
Crypto tickers:
`-ac_prices="ETH,LTC,BNB,NEO,LRC,QTUM,OMG,ZRX,STRAT,IOTA,XVG,KMD,EOS,ZEC,DASH,XRP,STORJ,XMR,BAT,BTS,LSK,ADA,WAVES,STEEM,RVN,DCR,XEM,ICX, HOT,ENJ"`
Stock tickers:
`-ac_stocks="AAPL,ADBE,ADSK,AKAM,AMD,AMZN,ATVI,BB,CDW,CRM,CSCO,CYBR,DBX,EA,FB,GDDY,GOOG,GRMN,GSAT,HPQ,IBM,INFY,INTC,INTU,JNPR,MSFT,MSI,MU,MXL,NATI,NCR,NFLX,NTAP,NVDA,ORCL,PANW,PYPL,QCOM,RHT,S,SHOP,SNAP,SPOT,SYMC,SYNA,T,TRIP,TWTR,TXN,VMW,VOD,VRSN,VZ,WDC,XRX,YELP,YNDX,ZEN,XAU,XAG,XPT,XPD,DJIA,SPX,NDX,VIX,BRK.A"`

and -earlytxid of airdrop plan with such params:
 `paymentsairdrop '[576,100,0,3999,0,0]'`

What should mean funds unlock every 576 blocks (~each two 48 hours) with snapshot every 288 blocks (~once in 24 hours) with 100 coins in fees minrelease for up to 3999 top BETS0 holders wallets


[16-May-19 05:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think `ac_snapshot` sshould be 288 blocks. U300s block time makes 288 blocks per day?  Doing it too often is not a good idea...


[16-May-19 05:07 AM] TonyL#3577
Yep, should be 288 blocks per day


[16-May-19 05:08 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha, so maturing should be 288 as well I wonder


[16-May-19 05:08 AM] TonyL#3577
If maturing is faster than snapshot it looks not fair


[16-May-19 05:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
snapshot just determines who ranks on rich list... It shouldnt really change much each day...


[16-May-19 05:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
guess with a chain with basically 0 balacne on it though.... 🤔


[16-May-19 05:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
you can just make lockedblocks 2x288 
So it takes 2 days, before any fees can be paid out.

cluster is ok, doesnt matter until notarized


[16-May-19 06:56 AM] TonyL#3577
Great, so will start such chain now. ~2 days should take data accumulation for smoothed prices, then on Sunday I'll test and then prepare interface multiOS bundles if betting works fine

[16-May-19 07:04 AM] dimxy#2587
I have read some more about how betting works. Probably we may improve something in prices.
First, how to find opposite positions which cancel out each other. Now I use very simple algorithm just searching explicit opposites like BTC_USD vs BTC_USD,!
I understand real betting brokers calculate correlation between prices for some period which allows to compare different prices.
(BTW we earlier discussed that XYZ_BTC cancels out BTC_ABC but now I see we could take into account the correlation between those prices)
So we might calculate a correlation matrix between prices for some period and use to better define cancelling positions (like EUR_USD vs USD_GBP). 
I think this would even allow to oppose complex synthetics (what we now do not yet)
 
Second, about risk management. Seems betting companies have several strategies. For instance, there are two kinds of orderbooks, A and B. 
As I understood orders in B book are just opposite positions betting against each other, that involves now risk for the house.
But if there are many positions betting in the same direction the house can go on real markets with these funds taking off risks from itself (with A book orders).
Seems we cannot use such strategy in prices cc? That is all we can do is just stop accepting bets if risks of losses for the house are too high, as in this case the house actually bets against the bettors.


[16-May-19 07:23 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe there can be a special bet that allows anybody to fund the opposite positions


[16-May-19 07:53 AM] dimxy#2587
If such bets exist could it be an impression for a bettor that the house actually persuades him to make some kinds of bets? (seems betting companies do not disclose made bets publicly)


[16-May-19 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
just an idea that allows active balancing


[16-May-19 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
not for, or against it


[16-May-19 08:03 AM] dimxy#2587
I have now a rpc that allows a bettor to list all positions grouped by their symbols and up/down sign and where he could find an opposite position and available amount


[16-May-19 08:47 AM] TonyL#3577
Add corellation matrix approach in spot of risk management is definetly very interesting direction for house involvement


[16-May-19 08:48 AM] TonyL#3577
But to build reliable corellation matrix which really means something you need really good sampling depth


[16-May-19 08:48 AM] TonyL#3577
Few years lets say


[16-May-19 08:49 AM] TonyL#3577
And here there will be little difficulties because different coins were overlaid at different times


[16-May-19 08:51 AM] TonyL#3577
In general I think I can make some pilot API (or can do it as script) on top of Binance API (and also can combine it with stocks if needed) which will return corellation matrix for needed pairs. So pricesCC will able to just call this API and use data


[16-May-19 08:53 AM] TonyL#3577
Things with significant positive corellation we will be able to consider as same thing (in spot of risks) and it should simplify life


[16-May-19 08:57 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm for large synthetics we can make some algo based on corellation as well:
Lets say player opened position for synthetic with 3 elements - we can find  most negative corellation (between these prices datasets) "opposite" 3 elements combination and add it as  "recommended" opossite position with discount fee


[16-May-19 09:02 AM] jl777c#5810
if it has 3 elements, likely parts of if cancel out


[16-May-19 09:02 AM] jl777c#5810
what is important is the NET exposure


[16-May-19 09:02 AM] jl777c#5810
total amount long BTC, short BTC


[16-May-19 09:02 AM] jl777c#5810
long USD, short USD, ...


[16-May-19 09:02 AM] jl777c#5810
the net amount is the risk exposure to each coin


[16-May-19 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
so any bet that reduces the overall exposure is reducing risk and should be incentivized


[16-May-19 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
any bet that increases the overall exposure is increasing risk and should be de-incentivized


[16-May-19 09:04 AM] TonyL#3577
In cmc top100 99% of things have strong positive corelllation


[16-May-19 09:04 AM] TonyL#3577
So to simplify we can actually just abstract to crypto longs/shorts balance


[16-May-19 09:04 AM] jl777c#5810
that can be a secondary aspect, but it shouldnt be primary


[16-May-19 09:04 AM] jl777c#5810
statistical correlation usually works


[16-May-19 09:04 AM] jl777c#5810
usually


[16-May-19 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
but if it isnt a delta neutral portfolio, there is exposure, regardless of historical correlation


[16-May-19 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
unless you think that no single crypto will outperform the others


[16-May-19 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
or underperform


[16-May-19 09:06 AM] TonyL#3577
Anyway from past numbers you can take only "usually" cases because you can't know feature
For BTC_USD USD_BTC it's clear how to make 0 risk portfolio, yes


[16-May-19 09:07 AM] TonyL#3577
But if I open position: BTC_USD + some stable pair (USD/CHF let's say) - it's a different case already


[16-May-19 09:07 AM] TonyL#3577
Ah, maybe from huge synthetic just specify most volatile one


[16-May-19 09:12 AM] TonyL#3577
Beside of pairs corellation in spot of risks we should concider volatility: so if BTC_USD have lets say 3%/day avg volatility - Apple stocks move 0.3%/day everage and risks for house different (numbers just from head)


[16-May-19 09:14 AM] TonyL#3577
On Bitmex I can take x100 leverage for BTC but for some EOS or ADA only x20 - it's because of different volatility and trade volumes. Maybe we have to make similar leverage caps for different markets


[16-May-19 09:16 AM] dimxy#2587
I think for different markets should be different correlation matrixes, sure


[16-May-19 09:21 AM] TonyL#3577
I mean not corellation but volatility. Corellation matrixes we can build for everything actually, actually yes statistical corellation its how things did in past and "usually" (means maybe) it will behave same way in future. It might be some third circle of defence: 

Simpliest "first circle of defense" - less leverage on more volatile things
Second circle is to try balance things like BTC_USD USD_BTC (in long synthetics can balance most volatile components) - by dynamic maximal allowed leverage (similar to bookmakers float coefficients)
Third circle might be some statistical methods like corellation matrixes or common components analysis lets say - if Microsoft stocks corelates with BTCSV_BTC - we can try to balance these things and etc


[16-May-19 09:21 AM] TonyL#3577
Moreover I think there is one possibility which we not considered yet - fund can place bets as well


[16-May-19 09:25 AM] dimxy#2587
As I understood it when a bettor places a bet and the fund does not enter real market with this amount, it actually means this bettor is against the fund: if he wins the fund loses and pays its money.
And of course no an opposite bet


[16-May-19 09:26 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh I just had some crazy idea with risks balancing by automated crypto purchasing. Hedging and etc

[16-May-19 09:33 AM] jl777c#5810
this is why i suggested having a way to take on the opposite positions


[16-May-19 09:33 AM] jl777c#5810
then specific nodes can actively try to balance things


[16-May-19 09:33 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh these external purchases was the worst idea from the list above 😃


[16-May-19 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810

[16-May-19 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
we cant have anything overcomplicated


[16-May-19 09:36 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe forex and stock bets can be 777x


[16-May-19 09:36 AM] jl777c#5810
btcusd 100x


[16-May-19 09:36 AM] jl777c#5810
the rest 10x


[16-May-19 09:36 AM] jl777c#5810
complex synthetic uses the lowest

i think if people see that the balancing bets are incentivized, then they are more likely to do them, especially the contrarians who would want to make the bet against what everybody knows will happen


[16-May-19 12:42 PM] jl777c#5810
the question becomes what level of incentive can be allowed


[16-May-19 12:44 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe somewhere around usual maker/taker fee on CEXes
If we taking 0.5% for unbalanced positions we may take let's say 0.2% for "balancing" end


[16-May-19 12:44 PM] TonyL#3577
Or 0.5 0.3


[16-May-19 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe we make it 1% for unbalance and 0% for balancing


[16-May-19 12:47 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha, looks like Bitmex added longs paying to shorts / shorts paying to longs thing to solve similar balance problem


[16-May-19 12:47 PM] TonyL#3577
When more shorts than longs opened - there shorts paying to longs each 8 hours and vice versa


[16-May-19 12:48 PM] dimxy#2587
As I can see in the real world situations could be often when many positions are still unbalanced, so the house is at risk to lose


[16-May-19 12:49 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, perfect balance is never achieved


[16-May-19 12:49 PM] jl777c#5810
the trick is to manage it within the range where the capital available will absorb the worst case


[16-May-19 12:52 PM] TonyL#3577
I wonder we can evolve risk management mechanisms with each BETSX chain - let's say if chain 1 rekt - we can add more "defense" for next chain and start it with more funding and so on


[16-May-19 12:54 PM] TonyL#3577
Not possible to predict now what will happen because there is no such markets for now (at least I don't know any) where you can construct some synthetic with stocks and cryptos and bet on it with leverage


[16-May-19 12:54 PM] jl777c#5810
exactly


[16-May-19 12:55 PM] jl777c#5810
this is an iterative process


[16-May-19 12:55 PM] jl777c#5810
at some point the BETi chain will represent real money and we get to see the real testing


[16-May-19 12:55 PM] jl777c#5810
at first it will be easy to break though


[16-May-19 12:57 PM] TonyL#3577
Will BETS0 be pegged to BETS value?


[16-May-19 12:57 PM] TonyL#3577
Or maybe we can just set some bounty in KMD for best traders to try to drain it asap


[16-May-19 12:57 PM] jl777c#5810
if it is ready for sidechain testing, we can


[16-May-19 12:57 PM] TonyL#3577
And with each BETSi chain we can make traders tournament


[16-May-19 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, that is simpler


[16-May-19 12:58 PM] TonyL#3577
Until it's solid


[16-May-19 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe sidechain testing is done separately


[16-May-19 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
until the betting and sidechain are working in isolation


[16-May-19 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
then we combine it


[16-May-19 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
and it will automatically be a for money tournament all the time


[16-May-19 01:00 PM] TonyL#3577
Ok, so for now for BETSi chains will make bounty mechanics similar to KMDICE funds locked in betting plan


[16-May-19 01:01 PM] TonyL#3577
And I think I can put BETSi KMD gateway for winning withdrawal to battletest gateways as well


[16-May-19 01:01 PM] TonyL#3577
Ah, gateway import value not export 😃


[16-May-19 01:01 PM] TonyL#3577
So need vice versa - deposit some KMD to get some BETSi


[16-May-19 01:03 PM] jl777c#5810
how will you do that? you would need -ac_pegs working


[16-May-19 01:03 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, wait


[16-May-19 01:03 PM] jl777c#5810
you can make a normal KMD gateways CC


[16-May-19 01:03 PM] jl777c#5810
and then put orders in the DEX


[16-May-19 01:03 PM] TonyL#3577
Yeah, thats what I'm thinking about


[16-May-19 01:03 PM] TonyL#3577
gatewaysCC


[16-May-19 01:04 PM] TonyL#3577
I have 700 free supply now and 7000 locked in plan


[16-May-19 01:04 PM] TonyL#3577
At first I can sell these 700 in gatewaysCC for KMD


[16-May-19 01:04 PM] TonyL#3577
Then players can bet to try drain these funds and withdraw back


[16-May-19 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
or make an NFT, with expensive price


[16-May-19 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
the winner is the first that can purchase the NFT


[16-May-19 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
redeemable for all the deposited KMD


[16-May-19 01:05 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh nice idea


[16-May-19 01:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Only problem is that what if somebody will buy all available in gateway supply


[16-May-19 01:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Like a one person - it will kill all fun


[16-May-19 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
i think there would be contest participants that are just given a fixed amount of BET0


[16-May-19 01:09 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha, at first collect applications with discord username and wallet address, then just send available supply in same proportions between participants


[16-May-19 01:10 PM] TonyL#3577
Winner have to make most profit from trading


[16-May-19 01:15 PM] TonyL#3577
I think I have to redesign chain so:  700 supply + 7000 in fund if give each participant 7 coins (100 participants cap) it might take a lot of time and a lot of luck is needed to drain it.
I think I'll make 7000 circulating supply and 7000 funds in house so players will have 1:100 proportion


[16-May-19 01:16 PM] TonyL#3577
Have to make some leaderboard also


[16-May-19 01:16 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh explorer richlist will be leaderboard actually 😃

By CCN: On May 17, within minutes, the bitcoin price plummeted from around $7,800 to $6,400 in a flash crash, recording an unexpected 18 percent drop.        The sudden decline in the bitcoin price led the valuation

[17-May-19 12:51 AM] jl777c#5810
a single trader games bitstamp price (buy dumping 2000+ BTC!) to change bitmex marked price to gain on his short positions!


[17-May-19 12:52 AM] jl777c#5810
interestingly prices CC design avoids such things as we use the 24hr price so it isnt the free money the "short bitmex and dump on the market" strategy is


[17-May-19 01:08 AM] Andersen#8337
Mean  median  24Hrs  index  ?


[17-May-19 01:09 AM] Andersen#8337
Like  Bitmex marking price , but longer period


[17-May-19 01:14 AM] jl777c#5810
the marking price is the 24 average of the correlated prices: http://159.69.45.70:8050/


[17-May-19 01:14 AM] jl777c#5810
the green line


[17-May-19 01:15 AM] jl777c#5810
correlated price is the brown line, which is a randomly selected price from the past day that correlates with majority of price samples starting from that random price (rotating buffer)


[17-May-19 01:18 AM] Andersen#8337
great


[17-May-19 01:27 AM] jl777c#5810
it is still possible to mess around with prices, but only if you sustain it for better part of the day


[17-May-19 04:42 AM] jorian#4555
so you dump the market to shit, but because you opened short positions you profit insanely


[17-May-19 04:42 AM] jorian#4555
smart move


[17-May-19 05:48 AM] jl777c#5810
if he opened a 100x short, on a 35 million dollar sell, drops price $1000, makes $200 million?


[17-May-19 05:48 AM] jl777c#5810
even if he didnt collect the $35 mil from selling, it would be ok


[17-May-19 08:18 AM] TonyL#3577
Trying to make  testnet for BETS0 with same chain params but with little delay to test rekt bot and GUI 

So for this chain using specific daemon with  `#define PRICES_DAYWINDOW (7)` in komodo_defs.h but in prices output daywindow is 289. 
```  "result": "success",
  "seed": 2525121736298361961,
  "height": 27,
  "maxsamples": 1,
  "width": 580,
  "daywindow": 289,
  "numpricefeeds": 127
```
Am I need to change daywindow defining somewhere else?


[17-May-19 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
how is the 289 calculated in the rpc call that prints the "daywindow"


[17-May-19 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
the answer is in the source code


[17-May-19 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810

As I understand it should print just `PRICES_DAYWINDOW`


[17-May-19 08:29 AM] TonyL#3577
So problem is that `PRICES_DAYWINDOW` not changed


[17-May-19 08:41 AM] TonyL#3577
Problem was obviously on human side haha 😃 (messed with aliases and daemons folders)

Also looks suspicious that profits loss became more than positionsize with negative equity (I wonder if it's rekt it should became 0)
```  "positionsize": 1.00000000,
      "profits": -1.04048070,```


[17-May-19 10:24 AM] TonyL#3577
https://github.com/dimxy/komodo/blob/prices-rpc/src/cc/prices.cpp#L1337 I think there should be special case kinda `if is_rekt` it became 0 but not negative

should be, but no guarantee. need to handle even negative cases

actually it is time to setup some min amount percentage below which rekt is considered. 
Now I simply check if equity are  < 0.
Maybe set something like 10% from initial betamount ?


[17-May-19 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[17-May-19 11:07 AM] TonyL#3577
Will be these 10% of left equity returned back to player in case of rekt on this point?


[17-May-19 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
no


[17-May-19 11:08 AM] TonyL#3577
Insurance liquidation lambo fund? 😃


[17-May-19 11:08 AM] jl777c#5810
it will be split between whoever submits the rekt and the house


[17-May-19 11:08 AM] jl777c#5810
90% to house 10% to the rekt-er


[17-May-19 11:08 AM] jl777c#5810
i think that will ensure all rektable positions are rekt


[17-May-19 11:09 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm,  10% from initial betamount looks too huge


[17-May-19 11:09 AM] TonyL#3577
imo


[17-May-19 11:10 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe something around 2-3%?


[17-May-19 11:11 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe depends on leverage


[17-May-19 11:11 AM] jl777c#5810
the more leverage the higher the percentage cutoff


[17-May-19 11:11 AM] jl777c#5810
2% for 1:1, 10% for 100x


[17-May-19 11:11 AM] TonyL#3577
Since fee is flat - thats fair


[17-May-19 11:11 AM] jl777c#5810
with the daily smoothing its not like dumping 2000 BTC to change the price will rekt you immediate


[17-May-19 02:06 PM] dimxy#2587
BTW, before this, we fixed to whom who did rekt 0,2% from the amount
now he will receive from 2%\*10% = 0,2% to 10%\*10% = 1%


[17-May-19 02:10 PM] TonyL#3577

so i need to wait for sometime

but cannot check arithmetic  as no historical data yet

it still easily goes negative with leverage 777 even with min margin (or something wrong with arithmetic)
(but my daywindow is test and small =7)


[17-May-19 03:24 PM] TonyL#3577
Using same daywindow on the test chain


[17-May-19 03:24 PM] TonyL#3577
What if for this use some variable B which connected to variable A and if variable A is positive B = A, but if A is negative B = 0 ?


[17-May-19 03:25 PM] TonyL#3577
So B will never jump into negative


[17-May-19 03:27 PM] TonyL#3577
Have non-zero data for my positions afrer update with some negative profits/equity


[17-May-19 03:30 PM] TonyL#3577
In general if despite of negative amounts all payouts doing correct I can just show negative as 0 in GUI


[17-May-19 03:34 PM] dimxy#2587
it is possible, just arithmetic  will be incorrect in pricesinfo


[17-May-19 03:36 PM] dimxy#2587
as I understand  777 is too big, and 100%/777 = just 0,12% price change sends position to negative


[17-May-19 03:38 PM] dimxy#2587
as we allow %1 price change per block we probably should not allow leverage > 100 or even less


[17-May-19 03:40 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha, x100 is nice limit


[17-May-19 03:40 PM] TonyL#3577

Hi @dimxy ! So if back to rekt things:
https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/8Cyvw5fxz3/ made some rekts yesterday, it looks like 10% from `profit` sending to "rekter" (since profits went negative `-1.5` rekter received `~0.15`, for other bet where profit was `-1` rekter received `~0.1`
I thought it should be 10% from 10%


[18-May-19 05:48 AM] dimxy#2587
yes, needs to be corrected


[18-May-19 05:51 AM] dimxy#2587
I thought yet about negative equity due to large loss: 
if we cut such losses at 10% not allowing to go negative, we would actually forgive the bettor his losses from his thoughtless big leverages.  It could be unfair


[18-May-19 05:53 AM] dimxy#2587
I think better to limit allowed leverages to never allow to go negative.


[18-May-19 05:54 AM] TonyL#3577
I had some dream last night about PoW rekt mechanics 😂

[18-May-19 05:56 AM] dimxy#2587
Unlike bitmex or similar who can more precise control on prices moves, we don have it as we have 10min time interval and changes might go to  1%


[18-May-19 05:57 AM] TonyL#3577
Btw I'm starting chains with 5 mins blocktime now


[18-May-19 05:57 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, we have not best mechanics for high leverages gambling


[18-May-19 05:57 AM] TonyL#3577
But just can left it up to 100 in case if somebody will want to sponsor house this way 😃


[18-May-19 05:58 AM] dimxy#2587
i can see you use 200 leverage, so 0,5% move would eat position


[18-May-19 05:58 AM] TonyL#3577
Yeah, very easy to get rekt


[18-May-19 05:59 AM] TonyL#3577
But almost impossible to take profit because bet maturing 24 hours


[18-May-19 06:01 AM] TonyL#3577
Only attention deserving strategy with high leverage is scalping - but imo it's not possible to scalp with 24 hours delay and bet on average


[18-May-19 06:05 AM] dimxy#2587
yes our betting is based on very smoothed value


[18-May-19 06:07 AM] TonyL#3577
From my point of view it's strategy based mostly on apophenia TA and coin toss gambling - maybe for such bets chain with blocktime/prices updates every 10 seconds or so is needed

But if somebody will want to sponsor fund on 10 minutes blocks chain - it's good for fund 😃


[18-May-19 06:11 AM] jl777c#5810
we cant have too fast a blocktime, that would mean a lot of price queries and nodes could get blocked


[18-May-19 06:12 AM] dimxy#2587
the services return updates with 1 min interval as I can see


[18-May-19 06:13 AM] jl777c#5810
not faster than a minute, yes


[18-May-19 06:14 AM] jl777c#5810
for 10 minute blocks, i think at 2 minutes or so

@dimxy Updated. https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/DZZMkVTSHW/ initial bet size was 1 coin but in rekt outputs only ~0.84 🤔

[18-May-19 08:43 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha, looks like initial 0.995 bet (1 - 0.5% txfee) was separated there, and then on rekt this 0.84 vout used

[18-May-19 08:45 AM] dimxy#2587
0.84 is probably the change


[18-May-19 08:49 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm thats strange - it looks like in input tx of pricesrekt 0.15 from initial 0.995 bet returned to player and 0.84 to fund

Also rekter received  `"value": 0.00100000,`, initial bet was 1 coin (200 leverage), 10% from 1 coin is 0.1, 2% from 0.1 is 0.002


[18-May-19 08:57 AM] dimxy#2587
actually I consider fund's coins as a whole. That is I don't spend specific bet's inputs but add any available inputs from fund's global address and just provide the balance (if I correctly understand your concern)


[18-May-19 08:57 AM] TonyL#3577
Ah, I see


[18-May-19 08:57 AM] TonyL#3577
But anyway rekter received twice less funds than should


[18-May-19 08:58 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe math working not correct there because balance became negatvie


[18-May-19 09:01 AM] TonyL#3577
Funds coins as a whole sounds dangerous - like a one left hole might allow to spend all fund funds 
Just Ethereum DAO hack sit in memory 😃


[18-May-19 09:03 AM] dimxy#2587
need to consider this


[18-May-19 09:03 AM] dimxy#2587
fund value as whole allows better value management


[18-May-19 09:04 AM] TonyL#3577
Yeah, thats should remove complicity. Our chains isolated so aftermath of hack should be less than for ETH


[18-May-19 09:04 AM] dimxy#2587
BTW for large leverage seems we set min margin as 10% and rekt fee 10% from it


[18-May-19 09:04 AM] TonyL#3577
Thats one of assetchains as sidechains scaling advantages - easier to fork without mainchain value /info loss 😃


[18-May-19 09:06 AM] TonyL#3577
`BTW for large leverage seems we set min margin as 10% and rekt fee 10% from it`
Hmm in such case shouldn't it be `1 * 0.1 * 0.1 = 0.01` instead of 0.001 ?


[18-May-19 09:06 AM] dimxy#2587
min margin calculation is: 
[1, 100] - min margin propotional to leverage, 
[100, 777] - min margin fixed at 10% (otherwise it would grow > 50%)


[18-May-19 09:08 AM] dimxy#2587

```Funds coins as a whole sounds dangerous - like a one left hole might allow to spend all fund funds ```
In the validation code we check that only cashout or rekt transactions could spend the fund

if spending from global address, need to check txfee always in validation. I added function for this to make it easy

when everybody runs it, there will be a big mempool conflict


[19-May-19 12:08 AM] jl777c#5810
which is ok, but if there will be literally N variants of same tx, then this will likely cause some issues


[19-May-19 12:09 AM] jl777c#5810
i strongly suggest to require a rekt tx to be like faucetget, ie txid start and end with 0x00

[19-May-19 09:34 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe in future it can evaluate to some rekt mining so people will setup mining pools to share rekt rewards


[19-May-19 09:34 AM] TonyL#3577
Kinda on top of blockchain blocks some "rekt blocks" transactions


[19-May-19 09:38 AM] jl777c#5810
faucetget basically does mining and takes about 20 to 60 seconds


[19-May-19 09:45 AM] TonyL#3577
Yup, can remember that. I meant some version where diff is not hardcoded but dynamic

Ubuntu users who want to participate in prices testing might test this precompiled portable of prices web-interface and komodod 

1) Download
2) unzip
3) cd prices_app_v2
3) start daemon and wait until BETS0 is synced:  ```./komodod -ac_name=BETS0 -ac_cbopret=7 -ac_cc=10777 -ac_reward=10000 -ac_supply=156177 -ac_blocktime=300 -ac_snapshot=288 -ac_sapling=1 -ac_earlytxidcontract=237 -ac_prices="ETH, LTC, BNB, NEO, LRC, QTUM, OMG, ZRX, STRAT, IOTA, XVG, KMD, EOS, ZEC, DASH, XRP, STORJ, XMR, BAT, BTS, LSK, ADA, WAVES, STEEM, RVN, DCR, XEM, ICX, HOT, ENJ" -ac_stocks="AAPL,ADBE,ADSK,AKAM,AMD,AMZN,ATVI,BB,CDW,CRM,CSCO,CYBR,DBX,EA,FB,GDDY,GOOG,GRMN,GSAT,HPQ,IBM,INFY,INTC,INTU,JNPR,MSFT,MSI,MU,MXL,NATI,NCR,NFLX,NTAP,NVDA,ORCL,PANW,PYPL,QCOM,RHT,S,SHOP,SNAP,SPOT,SYMC,SYNA,T,TRIP,TWTR,TXN,VMW,VOD,VRSN,VZ,WDC,XRX,YELP,YNDX,ZEN,BRK.A" -addnode=159.69.45.70 -earlytxid=d0de610ad271e0ef966d006a1c6cde67780bb40118f3efdec9bf07e86081e184 -daemon```
4) Start application `./prices_app_v2`

5) Webinterface should be availiable in browser `0.0.0.0:777`

replace Rxxxxxxxxx with the address you got

`What can I do with this now?` - more details/guidance will be revealed during this week. Traders competition is coming 😃 
`BETS0` supply is not distributed yet and will be distributed among the participants. 

Testing of portable GUIs  start it's a step0 of preparation 😃

Good news is that no bets/rekts yet on BETS0 so I just updated it nodes. Temporary deleted from github testing portable GUI since it contains daemon out of consensus (rektsensus)


[21-May-19 11:39 AM] dimxy#2587
better to remove the validation of txid then... removed

How many bet tx are we expecting?
(searching the opposite bets algo is not very efficient and it might be a bottleneck)

`How many bet tx are we expecting?` 
In case of bots/automated trading it might be thousands per day. On early stages maybe tens-hundreds

just let me know when to start


[21-May-19 12:12 PM] TonyL#3577
Sure, you can start miner if you wish. Just blockreward is very low on REKT0 (10000 sat) because idea of this bounty chain is "fixed" supply


[21-May-19 12:16 PM] SHossain#0007
i'm not after mining reward. want to keep the chain going and validate all txs for tests

Hi, I thought that there was a really good explanation of how to create trading pairs by jl777 at the start of the channel.  Can't seem to find it.
Where should I look to find info on creating pairs?

Hi Tony 👋
Thanks.  I wasn't able to get the `synthetic` formatted correctly to make a bet.

I'm about to head out for the day but will try again tomorrow.

Which synthetic you've tried to make and which error received?


[02-Jun-19 06:16 AM] CrisF#3405
I tried "ZECUSD, USDAAPL, *, -1.7" and multiple variations of that.

I see, so doc is not clear I think :/

I'll add to it all pairs which activated on CFEKBET1 chain to make it more clear

can you play `prices` without LABS or you need LABS installed with prices?


[02-Jun-19 09:58 PM] Mylo#8306
`mypriceslist` changed to `pricesmylist` would not break the naming convention used for RPC calls (already noted on google doc) - everything is named `prices*****`


[02-Jun-19 09:59 PM] Mylo#8306
looks like answer to my first question is `can play without LABS` - because of the precompiled binaries example for pirces @TonyL


[02-Jun-19 09:59 PM] Mylo#8306
the "CFEKBET1" bundle.

from other side it might confuse somebody yeah

<app><func>
app=prices 

8 out of  9 RPC methods follow that naming convention.

but dont we currently have just one common pool too? i guess we need to separate things out per synthetic?

We have one common too at the moment


[06-Jun-19 01:05 PM] TonyL#3577
`i guess we need to separate things out per synthetic?` - I think it might be easier to implement on some chain where allowed to trade only few pais without possibility to create complex synthetics.
When you have endless amount of synthetics - you need to maintain funds in each synthetic pool to make player be able open positions. Now we have infinity variations of prices

are the quotes stored in the PRICES blockchain accessible by OTHER blockchain through some cross-chain verification/lookup, currently?

if so, can the OTHER blockchain issue a payment based on a quoted price being higher than a specified value?


[01-Oct-19 02:59 AM] Mylo#8306
e.g.
OTHER blockchain will send a payment every 50,000th block if PRICES records the price of KMD being >$0.60


[01-Oct-19 03:00 AM] Mylo#8306
if not now, possibly in the future.


[02-Oct-19 11:21 AM] dimxy#2587
The quotes are accessible only through prices rpc call (no any oracle solution for this yet AFAIK)


[02-Oct-19 11:32 AM] jl777c#5810
you would need to do something like the gateways CC does, write the merkle roots to an oracle for the PRICES chain. then you can prove any specific transaction, using merkle proofs.


[02-Oct-19 11:32 AM] jl777c#5810
the prices are stored in the coinbase opreturn. so prove the coinbase tx that has the price you need


[02-Oct-19 11:33 AM] jl777c#5810
alternatively, a multi-nspv solution  might be more direct way to solve this sort of multichain problem

above page is very out of date. there is a lot of different DTO that can be launched now

thanks! will update

hey out of curiosity @gcharang do you know how to retrieve stored prices on a chain via -ac_feed ?


[15-Jan-20 07:05 AM] jl777c#5810
there is an rpc for this, dont remember the details


[15-Jan-20 07:11 AM] TonyL#3577
If I remember correct it's a `prices` RPC call

at least that's what I used in my interface code 😅


[15-Jan-20 07:14 AM] sergipcm#2275
ok so I guess they can be fetched by ts


[15-Jan-20 07:14 AM] sergipcm#2275
or hopefully by closest matching block timestamp


[15-Jan-20 07:14 AM] sergipcm#2275
that would be helpfull


[15-Jan-20 07:15 AM] TonyL#3577
there are timestamps in response, sure


[15-Jan-20 07:16 AM] sergipcm#2275
hopefully we can have the RPC call documented soon


[15-Jan-20 07:17 AM] jl777c#5810
@gcharang this isnt documented?


[15-Jan-20 07:17 AM] sergipcm#2275
maybe I missed it but so far havent been able to find it

PricesCC doc
PricesCC - betting "game" based on “synthetic prices”, though most would call this margin trading  Users can open long and short leveraged positions against the house (CC module) for various assets. The prices of assets are recorded on the blockchain by a trustless oracle...

[15-Jan-20 07:20 AM] TonyL#3577
I can remember we've started to write some doc for a kmdlabs testers and then pricesCC testing stopped


[15-Jan-20 07:22 AM] sergipcm#2275
thats nice doc thanks Tony, would keep it to check it later. Guess its easier to understand how rpc call works here

@jl777c am still working on it
will have it ready by tomorrow

@dimxy from  <https://github.com/dimxy/komodo/wiki/%27Prices%27-module-configuration-notes>
> The Prices module also allows to add a custom shared object library that could retrieve values if the internal parser features are not sufficient. The library should implement a specific parsing function that will be provided with the returned json and configuration parameters for data retrieving and should return the value.

can you confirm what I have written below is an accurate description?
```
The Prices module allows the addition of a custom shared object library (a `.so` file) that has the necessary parsing function that can retrieve values from the json returned by a web api. This can be used if the the json returned is non-standard and the internal parser's features are not sufficient. The parsing function will take the json and some configuration options like `customdata` as arguments and returns the price

'is non-standard' may be?

[20-Jan-20 03:26 AM] gcharang#6833
ty! can you tell me the branch and repo from which I can test the latest prices module? @dimxy


[20-Jan-20 03:27 AM] dimxy#2587
it is in the jl777 FSM branch

> To make the Prices module work there should be also -ac_cbopret, -ac_cclib=prices and -ac_cc=n (where n >=2) komodod parameters.
@dimxy is the parameter `-ac_cclib=prices` still required to launch a prices chain ?


[20-Jan-20 06:31 AM] dimxy#2587
I dont know much about about this param -ac_cclib I thought it is needed to run cc as .so libs.
Prices cc module is built within komodod executable, so seems -ac_cclib is not needed
I tried to run a prices chain without it and no any errors occurred.


[20-Jan-20 06:33 AM] gcharang#6833
hmm, got it
the -ac_cclib param is used to indicate a so file that contains an entire Antara module (dynamic module)


[20-Jan-20 06:36 AM] dimxy#2587
I can see there is yet another prices.c in cc/games subdir


[20-Jan-20 06:36 AM] dimxy#2587
seems ac_cclib=prices is to load it


[20-Jan-20 06:38 AM] dimxy#2587
that prices.c is not related to the prices cc module which works with prices DTO data (obtained by ac_cbopret)


[20-Jan-20 06:47 AM] gcharang#6833
understood. fyi, this is the method to load a dynamic module (sudoku):
```
cd src/cc
./makecclib
cp sudokucc.so ../libcc.so
cd ../..
make -j$(nproc)
```
after doing that, the chain needs to be started with `-ac_cclib=sudoku`
anyway, this detail is not relevant now as prices cc is builtin

The -ac_feeds parameter has interval with minimum 120s. Why so high?


[24-Mar-20 10:19 PM] jl777c#5810
all nodes need to query online api and some (many) rate limit

[24-Mar-20 10:22 PM] Mylo#8306
Ok thanks. I’m going to test with non-financial data. Will have more questions relating to DTO.

40% of the way down this page, cumulative time waited average price.  https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v2/

Does kmd dto do any of this stuff?


[24-Mar-20 10:23 PM] Mylo#8306
Sorry on iPad, cannot disable embed atm


[24-Mar-20 10:24 PM] jl777c#5810
there isnt a weight to each DTO data, it is in consensus or it isnt. a binary state


[24-Mar-20 10:24 PM] jl777c#5810
you can construct whatever time series you want from the raw consensus data


[24-Mar-20 10:25 PM] Mylo#8306
Ok understand.


[24-Mar-20 10:25 PM] Mylo#8306
Thx
