Why is komodo doing kyc?

lol kinda rude they turned on the music on kushti because they had a 10min break.. why not let him talk for some of those 10min.


[27-Mar-21 12:08 PM] Komodefi#5638
the euro team is doing kyc out of a preponderance of caution. non kyc versions from dogedex and marmara chain are available and share the same orderbooks.


[27-Mar-21 12:08 PM] Jcharming#2693
We have to wrap mic checks and stuff for next speakers - note is taken though we're figuring out our process as we go along.  
It's a pretty tight schedule


[27-Mar-21 12:09 PM] jerny#8324
totally understandable


[27-Mar-21 12:09 PM] Jcharming#2693
Definitely lots of love for Ergo and I've already got notes of setting up a CTO and tech talk that is more suited for that conversation - there was just so much good info

hey all, I'm getting some questions from the Turkish channel about participating, many of them don't speak english so they are having a difficult time with understanding the video. Is there a wrap up or something? or does that kind of defeat the purpose? I created a very rough transcript of the video (it's pretty large since it's +3 hours, so I'm keeping it in `.txt` format) it should be helpful for translations.


[30-Mar-21 05:28 AM] Regnar#6164
Here's the unofficial transcript from the video.

I didn't do any real editing, cleaning, or even proofing lol.


[30-Mar-21 05:31 AM] Regnar#6164
whole document is about 26 pages, and it's not perfect


[30-Mar-21 05:34 AM] unalsengun#0892
You are perfect Manüëçüëçüëç i read now on translate ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è


[30-Mar-21 05:35 AM] Regnar#6164
if you go through and translate the whole doc, make sure you share it with the Komodo-Turkey telegram channel


[30-Mar-21 05:36 AM] unalsengun#0892
Yes i will share on turkish Komodo too


[30-Mar-21 05:36 AM] unalsengun#0892
And i have also a telegram group and a big Instagram group


[30-Mar-21 05:37 AM] unalsengun#0892
i share Komodo everytime on social platforms and now i will share this event too

Looks like Google translate lets you upload .txt files directly and get the plain text results. Just copy it all and save to a new text file.


[30-Mar-21 05:58 AM] Regnar#6164
Just tried it, looks like a bunch was translated to turkish but some stuff still looks like english. nbd, save the turkish chunks and retranslate the remainder lol


[30-Mar-21 06:30 AM] Regnar#6164
Also I saved the script I wrote to build that transcript, so I can run it again on most any video assuming the video has captions enabled.

wow, thanks @Regnar !

We are looking to publish the presentations separately over the coming weeks. 

Perhaps we should publish a short wrap-up blog post also and then later update all the presentations there.

If someone is wondering what the whole BPSAA is about then this one is a good starting point: https://blog.komodoplatform.com/en/earn4learning-bpsaa-spring-2021/

What I've learned from the @BPSAA_Official webinar: 
1) #Privacy. From @TheInfamousKata (@PirateChain) I've learned that our privacy is under attack.
But we can avoid that with so called shielded peer to peer transactions on the pirate chain!

Is it possible for token holders to anticipate that Kmd may be able to introduce new tokens specifically for the use of Atomix Dex. Tha would be great for mass adaption and good marketing in my opinion.


[04-Apr-21 10:47 PM] Mylo#8306
it's a good question.  i flicked through an anonymizing eth whitepaper, and the function of mixing eth introduced "LP tokens" for holders (investors) to receive the fee for mixing.

This and many other "LP token" mechanism already existed/exists in KMD ecosystem.
Any fees that are payable for network services (e.g. DEX fee in a trade) are usually more than offset by the 5% user rewards of holding KMD.

Market makers have "LP tokens" in other ecosystems.  The DEX asset is the equivalent perhaps, in KMD.


[04-Apr-21 10:48 PM] Mylo#8306
But the DEX asset is not used for market making, it's the original supporters asset for building the dex software/protocol/infra
