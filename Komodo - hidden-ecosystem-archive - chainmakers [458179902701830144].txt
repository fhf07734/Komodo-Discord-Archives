Awesome job @siu ,  will it begin on Sunday?


[13-Jul-18 04:53 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I can run a flash 48 hour KMD giveaway to buy into the dICO.    
Between the last three I've done, i've been able to garner about 200K views and thousands of interactions and over 100 entrants.
Glad to do it from my own KMD pile, just a few to get someone to buy in.   Maybe 25 of my own and 15 from @Alright (he donated 15 "kmd" to the last raffle right after it ended so I pushed it to this one).


[13-Jul-18 04:54 PM] FishyGuts#5085
If so I will spam it on twitter and people here can spam it for exposure.   Typically the entry requires a RT with three tags.   If you have any thoughts or ideas, I am all ears üòÉ

[09-Aug-18 04:55 AM] siu#3920
GLX is developing its own iteration of some tools so they might take some time to go public.


[09-Aug-18 04:55 AM] siu#3920
They have not backed down or anything.


[09-Aug-18 04:56 AM] siu#3920
On the contrary, they have been working hard to get KMD tech to a better UX.


[09-Aug-18 12:30 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I chatted with some of the glx guys on their platform


[09-Aug-18 12:31 PM] Cryptoon#3362

Hi! Just wonder how mutch will be the yearly cost for using KOMODO main chain notarization for asset chain? In whitepaper it says 333KMD yearly. Is it still true, or price was changed?


[10-Aug-18 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chnmkrs] <siu> Hello! The price we charge for annual notarization is 300KMD and 800 of the coin being notarized


[10-Aug-18 01:43 PM] Ara#8697
Also can we use JUMBLR in asset chain?


[10-Aug-18 01:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chnmkrs] <siu> Yes... JUMBLR is integrated in every komodo blockchain


[10-Aug-18 01:59 PM] xRobeSx#5136
is it really siu? I thought JUMBLR was just for KMD


[10-Aug-18 02:00 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, KMD only


[10-Aug-18 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
the more jumblr in one chain the better


[10-Aug-18 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chnmkrs] <siu> That is weird since i see the jumblr rpc calls undrr the assetchains


[10-Aug-18 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chnmkrs] <siu> Im sorry. I verified. Even though the rpc calls are there for all assetchains. Its not reliable to jumblr funds on chains with low tx volume so its not activated on assetchains

[dscrd-chnmkrs] <Cryptoon> Well didnt get it yet, but they did ask for tx ids etc... Only 30ish kmd worth or so (back when was worth 1,75$ though)

Hey guys, I just want to let you know I have had a KMD tipbot made for KMD discord.  
If you have your own discord, it will work there for KMD and you are free to use it.   

DM me for the link and I will get you setup with the creator.

KMDICE has a coin supply of 21 million, of which 10.5 million has been premined


[17-Oct-18 01:57 PM] jorian#4555
this premine has gone into a fund


[17-Oct-18 01:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Some for CHAIN hodlers?

this fund is a dicefund, based on the CryptoConditions that have been tested and developed in the last weeks.


[17-Oct-18 02:00 PM] Raydeon#2053
Is there a website.


[17-Oct-18 02:00 PM] jorian#4555
what this basically means is that when you own KMDICE, you can use that to do some gambling. 
```minimum bet: 0.001
maximum bet: 1000
maximum odds: 1500
```
so, for example, you can bet 10 KMDICE at 5:1. if you win, you get 50 back


[17-Oct-18 02:00 PM] jorian#4555
website is being worked on as we speak


[17-Oct-18 02:01 PM] CheeseBaby#1954

[17-Oct-18 02:02 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
what makes it different from CHIPS? future functionality wise that is


[17-Oct-18 02:02 PM] jorian#4555
DICE, so if you bet 5:1, you have 1/5 chance you win. 6:1: 1/6. 60:1, 1/60


[17-Oct-18 02:02 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[17-Oct-18 02:03 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
why use KMDICE instead of CHIPS as a gaming/betting token


[17-Oct-18 02:03 PM] jorian#4555
CHIPS is far from done


[17-Oct-18 02:04 PM] jorian#4555
and uses a completely different approach


[17-Oct-18 02:04 PM] jorian#4555
essentially, you will be able to do the same with CHIPS


[17-Oct-18 02:04 PM] jorian#4555
but CHIPS is not done yet. KMDICE is.


[17-Oct-18 02:04 PM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Kmdice has a ring to it also

CHIPS is useful, because it uses lightning channels

We think that with this coin we can move ahead development on top of Crypto Conditions.


[17-Oct-18 02:06 PM] jorian#4555
which means there are no on-chain transactions of whatever many transactions happen inside these channels

this is useful for playing poker

[17-Oct-18 02:07 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
so using KMDICE for poker is not as good/convenient/possible as CHIPS?


[17-Oct-18 02:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If there is no house edge then in theory the losses are only tx fees? @WayneDingo

[17-Oct-18 02:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy for kmdice I assume every move is a tx, which is not the case when using lightning


[17-Oct-18 02:09 PM] siu#3920
The bet is just a other type of tx for KMDICE


[17-Oct-18 02:09 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Playing poker become expensive if every move from every player at the table is a tx


[17-Oct-18 02:09 PM] siu#3920
Only that in a CC address


[17-Oct-18 02:09 PM] WayneDingo#1455
Is this one of those provably fair random number generator deals where you bet a token and 3 numbers spin to the high or low?


[17-Oct-18 02:09 PM] jorian#4555
you can't play poker with KMDICE


[17-Oct-18 02:10 PM] jorian#4555
it is very simple: bet an amount at some odds; the higher the odds, the higher the payout if you win


[17-Oct-18 02:10 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
makes sense @Cryptoon, thanks for info

[17-Oct-18 04:16 PM] siu#3920
so  we now have a coin which 50% of the supply is locked in a dice game contract and the only way to get that 50% is by betting the other 50% of the supply against it


[17-Oct-18 04:17 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
or if I mine and play, using the remaining 25% to get 75% out of the contract üòõ

So how does it work ,  meaning how does mining vs locked coins work


[17-Oct-18 04:30 PM] SHossain#0007
50% premine which is locked to dice game contract. mine the otrher 50% and play to win the first 50%


[17-Oct-18 04:31 PM] siu#3920
who will win? ü§î

I can imagine with the difficulty it would be like 10 kmd for 100 DICE -- but I have no idea how long it takes to mine either - 10 KMD for 1000 DICE?? I guess the miners win this game

We spent like what a week on dice on staked for Smk to make a GUI... We found there was no way to withdraw coins James told us to leave it as it had an attack vector and couldn't be used in production... BTW if lots of ppl play your going to need more than one chain, it doesn't like being tx flooded with bets.

it doesnt need its own chain... and the dealer can never withdraw

Will any of the previous Stake coins carry forward or is it starting off fresh? @Deleted User

the STAKED4 coins will be kept .


[17-Oct-18 07:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
but we will probably time lock them, so they cannot be staked for a certain amount of time to ahve a fair launch

the supply is tiny at the point anyway less than 1 million

the surrent chains are just a test net .. all will be discarded

[17-Oct-18 07:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yes... I have a chain that only the creator can mine, by a consenus rule, so that nobody else cna submit data to it, and I have a way of sequentially feeding in 8kb chunks of data into the opreturn in a way that allows them to be taken back out and reassembeled.

Im pissed because we did all the testing and work to launch something like this, and weere told to stop working on it because it had some flaw, and the funds in the contract could not be withdrawn. They have gone ahead and launched a chain, that doesnt respect ANY of the limitations we found in testing, and clearly didnt test it.

Why dafuq "should" anyone be pissed? Did you really think james made the feken contract, put it on the public git, and it was *solely* for STAKED and no one would ever use it? Really?

you can use dice on any AC it doesnt need a new chain... Im confused as hell.

the dice CC should not be used for any big money bets, there is a known 51% vuln


[17-Oct-18 09:54 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a cool demo and if KMDICE leads to an improved dice2 CC and GUI that is a good thing


[17-Oct-18 09:54 PM] jl777c#5810
but do not imagine the dice CC in its current state is ready for production usage


[17-Oct-18 09:56 PM] jl777c#5810
an assetchain kind of has an automatic path to being dPoW and a chain without dPoW just feels like not even a testchain, but having dPoW doesnt mean the chain itself is ready for casino level usage.

Following this warning, I will not take this new assetchain seriously yet. So, at least I'll be just watching it from sideline. It's cool thing, but I'll stay away from mining/buying it yet. Let's see how things turns out. ü§î

Keep it CPU mineable so people can all play nice and easily and we will make progress.... if everyone starts thinking the coins have value people will start hoarding them and not testing anything ... thats the oppsite of what this chain was made for.

Creating a dice GUI was something i had on my list, but given my limited out of work hours and the inherent issues with 51% and withdrawl, I left it alone after knocking up the TUI. Far down my list now, if at all. Much more interested in implementing LBS via oracles now.


[17-Oct-18 10:19 PM] Deleted User#0000 (pinned)
```From my testing on DICEv1 anyone looking to improve it needs to start with the following:
1) Show if the contract has entropy TX in diceinfo 
2) Have a table end parameter on table creation, where the dice contract expires and the funds can be withdrawn by the creator
3) Figure some solution to scale, a single table can only take so many parallell bets before it just stops working. 
4) Make a GUI to make it easier for people to play```


[17-Oct-18 10:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
In that order


[17-Oct-18 10:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
the 51% problem is low chances with close enough dPoW freq... we were gfong to try and notarise the chain with just 2 blocks, this could also be solved, by having a single miner, like I have done with STREAMER chain, and have all coins mined out of the faucet.


[17-Oct-18 10:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
Or if you want to bet wirh real money, use a sister chain, where coins are mined/ bought and MoMoM migrate them to the DICE chain to play dice.


[17-Oct-18 10:24 PM] jl777c#5810

We did this to have a public chain people can use to try dice and get some people from the community pumped to make a gui


[18-Oct-18 01:17 AM] siu#3920
We have no interest in withdrawing the funds locked, that is why we put 50% of the supply in the contract. Just to see what happens


[18-Oct-18 01:18 AM] siu#3920
If more coins end up locked or if all the coins are withdrawn we dont know and that is kind of the purpose.


[18-Oct-18 01:18 AM] siu#3920
We didnt get any funding for this or separated any coins for funding... it was just an idea that grew in itself too fast.

As you say, anyone can do a dice contract in any assetchain so you can do your own. The purpose of this one is to exclusively use it for dice game only and locking most of the coins for this sole purpose.

Also if it was james who said it was not production ready wjat made you stop, the difference here is that we didnt ask james.

Hello @everyone, we will be doing an airdrop of 75% of Chainmakers funds this december. This means that CHAIN notary nodes voters will get a holiday's present from Chainmakers! üéâ  The snapshot for the airdrop will be done on Friday, December 14, 2018. So users can have some time to put their CHAIN in a accessible wallet. The actual airdrop we hope to be able to do it during the weekend. We will let you know when all is ready. HAPPY HOLIDAYS!

so taking into account that total funds is 35,265 KMD, the total airdrop will be of 26,448.75KMD

to 900,000 CHAIN

since we wont include the Chainmakers development funds addresses.

You just need to hold CHAIN in a address you hold, preferably in agama.

For the Airdrop i think


[14-Dec-18 04:07 AM] jorian#4555
yes, the airdrop. this file contains all addresses that are included in the airdrop. The threshold is 0.01 CHAIN

you guys considering moving CHAIN to assets contract once KMD has cc activated?


[14-Dec-18 05:20 AM] Alright#0419
just throwing the idea out there, we'll need someone to showcase it eventually


[14-Dec-18 06:17 AM] jorian#4555
@Alright care to explain that a bit?


[14-Dec-18 06:17 AM] jorian#4555
assets contract?


[14-Dec-18 06:23 AM] siu#3920
he means a token in komodo


[14-Dec-18 06:23 AM] siu#3920
using tokens contract


[14-Dec-18 06:24 AM] jorian#4555
to do what exactly?


[14-Dec-18 06:36 AM] Alright#0419
not sure what CHAIN is exactly, but if it's solely for paying out KMD, seems a perfect fit for an on chain asset


[14-Dec-18 06:41 AM] jorian#4555
why?


[14-Dec-18 06:42 AM] Alright#0419
Why not? :trollface:


[14-Dec-18 06:43 AM] Alright#0419
but seriously, does it have any reason to be it's on chain if it could instead just be on KMD itself as a token


[14-Dec-18 06:43 AM] Alright#0419
this is all based on the assumption that it's only for payouts, not sure what else it does


[14-Dec-18 06:43 AM] jorian#4555
oh you mean as a token on KMD.. i thought on CHAIN


[14-Dec-18 06:43 AM] jorian#4555
ok, maybe that's a good idea


[14-Dec-18 06:44 AM] jorian#4555

Hi here :).
Barterlly is now open on BETA mode, and will provide tools for users and CoinOwners to perform OTC trades in a safe way.
Any KMD assetchain dPowed will be listed, and supported, for free.
Other coins not already listed can submit a listing application at : https://barterlly.typeform.com/to/iqpS1H
During the BETA, Barterlly won't charge any fee other than the transaction ones. after the release we will charge 1% on top of every transaction.
Our goal is to provide premium tools for coins listed on the platform. (Discord swapbot, twitter integration, public orders, wallet integration, API, custom templating, and many more).
Feel free to join us on our Discord.
https://discord.gg/RHc95zw
The app link is located at : https://app.barterlly.io
We are open to suggestions, and partnerships.

See you soon !

Barterlly's team

i think 1% is too much fee huh? should be 0.1% and after 1year or so 1% cuz i think there will be more people out there who will join if there is lower fee


[30-Jun-19 03:32 AM] Oszy#5734
considering the $ amount it took to develop barterlly without any public community funding i say it's fair for now. there were huge costs to make it legal as well.

Where do you enter the seed in chameleon pay?


[13-Jul-19 05:33 AM] BitcoinTony123#2784
Hello, I was wondering how much it costs to set up an average Smart Chain? Also, do I pay for it to be set up in KMD? Thanks


[13-Jul-19 05:44 AM] gcharang#6833
@BitcoinTony123 
to setup the smartchains by yourself, there is no cost: https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/installations/creating-asset-chains.html

to have the process in the above doc done  automatically, along with various services, we have a blockchain builder coming soon (web portal and aws managed vps used to create the chains), will also have spv servers, explorers etc., - yet to launch, prices to be announced
^^^ all the above can be done as DIY by a capable developer

To add dPoW, there are additional costs

atleast 365 KMD + 365 coin to be notarized + integration costs

[13-Jul-19 05:47 AM] BitcoinTony123#2784
Great thanks! is this atleast 365 KMD + 365 coin to be notarized a 1 time payment?


[13-Jul-19 05:47 AM] BitcoinTony123#2784
and do you have any estimates on how much integration costs are?


[13-Jul-19 05:47 AM] gcharang#6833
365 KMD + 365 coin - per year


[13-Jul-19 05:49 AM] BitcoinTony123#2784
Great


[13-Jul-19 05:50 AM] BitcoinTony123#2784
Do you have any estimates on how much integration costs are?


[13-Jul-19 05:50 AM] BitcoinTony123#2784
Sorry for my persistance, I just want to get it right


[13-Jul-19 05:50 AM] gcharang#6833
will let you know in a moment, just asked in internal chat


[13-Jul-19 05:53 AM] BitcoinTony123#2784
ok thanks!


[13-Jul-19 06:11 AM] gcharang#6833
@BitcoinTony123 
the prices are not public currently
but  its currently several thousand dollars for a smart chain (i.e., a chain created using Komodo)

for an external chain that is  a BTC fork, there are additional costs of adding the dPoW code to their coin and a security audit
prices will be made public with the auto blockchain builder coming soon


[13-Jul-19 06:19 AM] BitcoinTony123#2784
Great, final question, Is this only payable in KMD?


[13-Jul-19 06:32 AM] gcharang#6833
365 KMD + 365 coin in their respective coins
integration costs: I think BTC and KMD will be accepted, other forms of payment not sure


[13-Jul-19 10:26 AM] BitcoinTony123#2784
Ok thanks for the help

@siu does chainswap use the same liquidity that atomicdex uses? There seems to be less on chainswap


[04-Oct-19 01:18 AM] jorian#4555
same liquidity as on atomicdex mobile


[04-Oct-19 01:18 AM] jorian#4555
you just see less on chainswap, because you can't see all the orders


[04-Oct-19 01:19 AM] jorian#4555

@jorian can the chainswap desktop app unlock funds stuck when using the hyperDEX app?


[22-Oct-19 03:27 AM] Oszy#5734
@gcharang are you trying to get that guy's DEX back?


[22-Oct-19 03:27 AM] gcharang#6833
yup


[22-Oct-19 03:28 AM] Oszy#5734
if you could get him to have curl and sha256 his seed (userpass) it can be done in 1 command whilst running hyperdex


[22-Oct-19 03:28 AM] Oszy#5734
It's how i done it with chainswap before


[22-Oct-19 03:29 AM] gcharang#6833
do you know if the latest hyperDEX release has mm2 with `recover_funds_of_swap` ?


[22-Oct-19 03:30 AM] Oszy#5734
now that's what i am afraid of that it might not


[22-Oct-19 03:30 AM] gcharang#6833
I'll check


[22-Oct-19 03:31 AM] Oszy#5734
but there is no unlock funds button in the chainswap gui  to answer you question i only seen it in atomicdex so far


[22-Oct-19 03:32 AM] gcharang#6833
thanks for that, I guess building mm2 is the way to go for him


[22-Oct-19 03:33 AM] Oszy#5734
IF he's willing to sure.


[22-Oct-19 03:35 AM] gcharang#6833
do the both apps use the same data directory?

even if they don't ,if chainswap app has the mm2 with the `recover_funds_of_swap` api, the curl method might work
I will try with chainswap first


[22-Oct-19 03:36 AM] Oszy#5734
not sure i didn't use hyperdex on the same machine, they're both in appdata/local/programs on win


[22-Oct-19 03:37 AM] Oszy#5734
both has the mm2.exe in the folder


[22-Oct-19 03:38 AM] Oszy#5734
maybe he could overwrite HD binary with Chainswap binary and launch HD with updated mm


[22-Oct-19 03:40 AM] gcharang#6833
ok, will try all the options

so the mm2 instance started by chainswap uses sha256 of seed words as userpass?


[22-Oct-19 03:41 AM] Oszy#5734
Yes
`function userpass(passphrase) {
  const pp = new Buffer(passphrase, 'utf8');
  return crypto.createHash('sha256').update(pp).digest('hex');
}`

@siu any help on making this work?

you can do the yarn install in the home directory now.

no need to do it for each package

hey makers how much monthly does it cost to run a new chain ?

is it possible to have a chain with forced minimum fee (always > 0 )

1. depends, 2. yes, although it depends on the miners

we can't dictate what miners mine
