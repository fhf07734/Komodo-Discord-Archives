there is only the need to make sure that it works and the sudoku aspect of it is a blackbox using external code anyway

what are you passing to `cclib` rpc?


[30-Jan-19 10:38 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm passing RPC arguments - it's quite same. For example to get list of pending puzzles: ``` pending_puzzles = rpc_connection.cclib("pending", "17")["pending"]
```


[30-Jan-19 10:40 AM] Alright#0419

trying to figure out what the equivalent is now. I see that cclibinfo output changed and the methods are now separated from contract name

`cclib "pending" "17"` ?


[30-Jan-19 10:42 AM] TonyL#3577
In cli it's `./komodo-cli -ac_name=SUDOKU cclib "pending" 17`


[30-Jan-19 10:42 AM] Alright#0419
I don't understand the list following where you called the function. Is that the response?


[30-Jan-19 10:42 AM] TonyL#3577
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=SUDOKU cclib "txidinfo" 17 \"5d13c1ad80daf37215c74809a36720c2ada90bacadb2e10bf0866092ce558432\"```
17 is evalcode


[30-Jan-19 10:42 AM] TonyL#3577
Which list?


[30-Jan-19 10:43 AM] Alright#0419
rpc_connection.cclib("pending", "17")`["pending"]`


[30-Jan-19 10:43 AM] TonyL#3577

test1 = test["b"]

[30-Jan-19 10:44 AM] Alright#0419
ah the result of the function is dict than "pending" is value?

[30-Jan-19 10:45 AM] TonyL#3577

Btw it's not so easy to connect automated solver even with current protection


[30-Jan-19 10:49 AM] TonyL#3577
There are tricky moments - especially when will be enabled full validation. That's why I have a dynamically updating dictionary where keys are cells numbers from 1 to 81 and values are timestamps from keyboard valid key input handler

[30-Jan-19 11:20 AM] TonyL#3577
It's in my enhancements list - navigation logic I not touched at all so far. Forked code loops looks very scary


[30-Jan-19 11:22 AM] TonyL#3577
Btw it's easy to use custom backgrounds - just need to put 600x400 background.png


[30-Jan-19 11:22 AM] TonyL#3577
So possible to make CFEK super custom skin


[30-Jan-19 12:32 PM] jl777c#5810
I just picked 60000 for a clusterid


[30-Jan-19 12:32 PM] jl777c#5810
i added support for multiple evalcodes, so I needed something other than faucet2 and didnt want to be lame and make faucet3


[30-Jan-19 12:32 PM] jl777c#5810
so I combined a gamified blockchain and made SUDOKU.


[30-Jan-19 12:33 PM] jl777c#5810
with the timestamps, we should be able to get a decent captcha, but I need a few dozen actually human solve times to train the AI with, hundreds would be better


[30-Jan-19 12:34 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe make some solving competion with screen streaming let's say on Twitch?


[30-Jan-19 12:34 PM] jl777c#5810
so when this is all working, it will be a gamified chain that is basically its own automated entity as it is an ac_perc chain, so as people solve puzzles new puzzles can be created. It will also create a database of sudoku solve timestamps to be useful for captcha pattern recognition


[30-Jan-19 12:35 PM] jl777c#5810
and the rich list will be the top sudoku solver list


[30-Jan-19 12:35 PM] TonyL#3577
To get more these human times


[30-Jan-19 12:35 PM] jl777c#5810
so it has the multifaceted purpose


[30-Jan-19 12:36 PM] jl777c#5810
I came up with another game I can put into the blockchain,but not sure yet if it will make sense.  I guess it can be a race for people to solve the same game, which turns what is otherwise a solitaire game into a multiplayer, even though there is no direct interaction


[30-Jan-19 12:37 PM] jl777c#5810
once all the sudoku are solved, then issuing a single one with multiple players turns it into a competitive race, but before we can have any much value to SUDOKU coins, we need the timestamp data


[30-Jan-19 12:38 PM] jl777c#5810
also, it serves as PR material as I could see some project raising 13 million USD, just to do a sudoku blockchain (2017), so it is funny that we achieve it in 2 days


[30-Jan-19 12:38 PM] jl777c#5810
any bugs?


[30-Jan-19 12:38 PM] Alright#0419
what is triggering the CC vout in coinbase


[30-Jan-19 12:38 PM] Alright#0419
I couldn't follow


[30-Jan-19 12:38 PM] jl777c#5810
triggering? it is an -ac_script chain


[30-Jan-19 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure if it is the first chain to ac_perc -> CC vout, that is another function


[30-Jan-19 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
and I made it a clusterable chain just in case it became massively popular


[30-Jan-19 12:40 PM] Alright#0419
so ac_script will just work with any CC vout?


[30-Jan-19 12:41 PM] Alright#0419
`cclib gen 17`


[30-Jan-19 12:41 PM] Alright#0419
the `"amount"` value returned seems random


[30-Jan-19 12:41 PM] Alright#0419
what is it?


[30-Jan-19 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
amount is based on the difficulty score for the generated sudoku


[30-Jan-19 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
the ac_script is specifically for the evalcode 17 to the global pubkey


[30-Jan-19 12:43 PM] Alright#0419
and when it returns `not enough SUDOKO funds`, is this not enough funds in CC address or not enough in my address?


[30-Jan-19 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
it uses global funds


[30-Jan-19 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
so not enough funds means not enough global funds


[30-Jan-19 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
anybody can create new sudoku using the global funds


[30-Jan-19 12:44 PM] Alright#0419
and `"srand"`, what is this?


[30-Jan-19 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
for now you need to be nice, please dont make illegal rpc calls


[30-Jan-19 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
srand is unix rng, read the docs


[30-Jan-19 12:44 PM] Alright#0419
yea, saw the validation code üòÇ


[30-Jan-19 12:45 PM] jl777c#5810
it is basically 1 day of coding and a few hours of bugfixing. couldnt fit in validation in that time


[30-Jan-19 12:45 PM] jl777c#5810
but now the adding of another evalcode is a matter to update a switch statement, well 2 of them, one for rpc another for validation

Ah ... read hint from ca333: `Well its not thaaat easy - c'mon. However, it is not involving the sudoku client at all. Only the above sudoku puzzle, Agama and a little bit of analytical thinking is needed.` )


[31-Jan-19 11:10 AM] Decker#3767

There is ongoing work /enhancement of building process to make it work with dynamic libs (cclib targeted separation of dynamic and static libs)


[02-Feb-19 06:45 AM] siu#3920
awesome


[02-Feb-19 06:46 AM] siu#3920
these cc libs for different languages are super needed


[02-Feb-19 06:55 AM] siu#3920
i just noticed that there are no sudoku rpc calls in help


[02-Feb-19 06:59 AM] TonyL#3577
I guess there is no connection now between `help` and functions in cclib
Anyway it's not possible to play Sudoku via cli calls (at least fair) because of captcha protection


[02-Feb-19 07:00 AM] siu#3920
oh


[02-Feb-19 07:00 AM] siu#3920
interesting


[02-Feb-19 07:00 AM] TonyL#3577
Result checking needs 81 timestamps as arguments and 81 numbers cells state line


[02-Feb-19 07:00 AM] TonyL#3577
And it should be ordered


[02-Feb-19 07:00 AM] TonyL#3577
So GUI handling all this stuff


[02-Feb-19 07:01 AM] siu#3920
so this is a completely new type of cc


[02-Feb-19 07:01 AM] TonyL#3577
It using faucet concepts / functions partially as I understand but this captcha concept is not used anywhere else


[02-Feb-19 07:01 AM] siu#3920
wow


[02-Feb-19 07:02 AM] TonyL#3577
And as for me this CC looks like a dAPP mostly since it have Sudoku generator embeed


[02-Feb-19 07:02 AM] TonyL#3577
And kinda app which sorting captcha stuff


[02-Feb-19 07:02 AM] TonyL#3577
So besides of transactions logic there is non transactions logic in this CC as well


[02-Feb-19 07:07 AM] siu#3920

https://github.com/tonymorony/Komodoku/releases published OSX portable and OSX latest FSM daemon 
Size is suspiciously less 3 times than Ubuntu portable so would be great if someone without pre-installed deps test :)

 @ca333 btw SUDOKU not syncing on beta branch so Windows is open question - tried to force cherry-pick last commits from beta-win to jl777/FSM and build but no luck

@TonyL thanks for the info. Have you tried launching just komodo on WIN to see if komodo net syncs/connects?


[14-Feb-19 01:19 AM] ca333#0333
lets try to find out if this is a sudoku related issue or general problem


[14-Feb-19 01:26 AM] TonyL#3577
@ca333 I've only tried to sync SUDOKU chain on OSX with beta branch komodod. It's stuck on some early block with error that I'm not in agreement with other peers. So I've rebuilt OSX on latest FSM and SUDOKU synced


[14-Feb-19 01:27 AM] TonyL#3577
On Windows not tried anything so far üòÉ  Let me try to build `beta_win` and check if it sync


[14-Feb-19 01:45 AM] ca333#0333
ok thanks @TonyL - if you need a different branch "WINifyied" let me know and i ll get you a temp`branch_win` up.

@ca333 built Windows from `beta_win` - have same problem with sync as on OSX beta:
```CC Eval 0x11 Invalid: mismatched -ac_cclib vs CClib_name spending tx d34dda12e3eb9c4ae85a953065974b1e48301c0bcc4c40883f99bfdb81c08003

I guess beta branch don't have sudoku cclib yet - on MacOS I've got same error when tried to sync with komodod from beta branch, then rebuilt from `jl777/FSM` and it synced fine

Hi @siu You tried 0.1b? Is it on Ubuntu or OSX? Is daemon synced fine and you able to call sudoku rpc calls?


[21-Feb-19 10:58 AM] TonyL#3577
It's not path error but seems problems in rpc calls


[21-Feb-19 10:58 AM] jl777c#5810
i had to make lots of changes for rogue and musig,maybe I broke sudoku


[21-Feb-19 11:08 AM] siu#3920
Yes, it was latest, but maybe i needed to recompile ./makecclib


[22-Feb-19 01:39 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c Is `./makecclib` is what what I need to use if I want Sudoku compatible daemon?


[22-Feb-19 01:39 AM] jl777c#5810
the libcc.so that is in the ~/komodo/src dir when komodod is built is the libcc.so that is inside the komodod


[22-Feb-19 01:40 AM] jl777c#5810
once this is understood, hopefully it will be easier to understand the various things going on


[22-Feb-19 01:40 AM] jl777c#5810
makecclib makes the sudoku libcc.so and overwrites whatever is in ~/komodo/src


[22-Feb-19 01:40 AM] jl777c#5810
same with the rogue


[22-Feb-19 01:41 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, I understand it. Only issue is that now jl777/FSM branches ./zcutil/build.sh making rogue libcc


[22-Feb-19 01:42 AM] TonyL#3577
./makerogue execution is hardcoded


[22-Feb-19 01:52 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[22-Feb-19 01:53 AM] jl777c#5810
once we get the dynamic libs actually dynamic, it will be much easier


[22-Feb-19 01:53 AM] jl777c#5810
just copy the libcc.so you want before starting komodod

On OSX this "old" binary seems work fine.
On Ubuntu built latest FSM now (just changed ./makerogue to ./makecclib in build.sh) - SUDOKU synced from scratch fine

Oh yes, new daemon need cclib args input with %22 %22, thats why it's working on old OSX daemon

Before it was like this:

  "result": "error",
  "error": "couldnt find txid",

But now its like a:

17 or 18 it's evalcode

@TonyL 

It says in your instructions that we need to use the FSM branch of Komodo to build Sudoku. Is that correct?

How does that correlate with building from the `jl777` branch for ROGUE?

Do we need to have separate `komodod` installations for ROGUE and SUDOKU, and anything else?


[11-Mar-19 10:26 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh, when this instruction was written ROGUE doesn't exist yet.

In general it's possible to build Sudoku compatible client from any branch, only difference is that daemon with sudoku cclib (same cclib as musig needs) instead of  roguecclib needed.
Now by default rogue cclib building. Easiest way to build SUDOKU client on fresh installation is change string `./makerogue` to `./makecclib` in `zcutil/build.sh` /  `zcutil/build-mac.sh` / `zcutil/build-win.sh`

```How does that correlate with building from the jl777 branch for ROGUE?```
In #cc-rogue channel description information that ROGUE should be built from FSM branch so not sure why it's needed to be built from jl777. All CC stuff is recommended to build from FSM because it's more stable


[11-Mar-19 10:34 PM] gcharang#6833
@Bryan_Beus musig and sudoku are in the same cclib so the musig instructions will work for sudoku as it is


[11-Mar-19 10:35 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok, so I'll rewrite the install instructions to mirror musig instead of rogue
