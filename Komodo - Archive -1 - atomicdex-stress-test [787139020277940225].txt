is it recommendable to fund atomicDEX with coins now?
I mean, while it is still beta
I want to try some BCH swaps too


[11-Dec-20 07:39 PM] Frank Lloyd Right#9796
I read somewhere, because it's still in beta, it's recommended to only trade relatively small amounts.


[11-Dec-20 07:45 PM] uak#6718
Yeah I guess it's fine for small amounts, I've done some, no issue.

I think the wallet part is solid now, but for trading we recommend trade small amount for the moment !

[11-Dec-20 08:42 PM] Frank Lloyd Right#9796

anytime!


[11-Dec-20 09:52 PM] Zed#8377
@Jcharming I downloaded the desktop app, installed it, re-registered the KMD address - but I see the DEX tab at the left side says 'DEX features are not allowed in CA'. Does this mean that I can't join in the test???? or is that something else?


[11-Dec-20 09:54 PM] Tofino#6999
Same here.  ‚òùÔ∏è I'm in Canada.


[11-Dec-20 09:55 PM] Zed#8377
Me too 'Eh' ... hahaha ....


[11-Dec-20 09:56 PM] Tofino#6999
hey! did you install app on your phone? DEX works in the app


[11-Dec-20 09:56 PM] Zed#8377
No - desktop on Windows machine.


[11-Dec-20 09:58 PM] Tofino#6999
right... I meant did you install on a phone **as well** üòÉ


[11-Dec-20 09:58 PM] Zed#8377
No - don't want to put this on my phone right now.


[11-Dec-20 09:59 PM] Zed#8377
I'm assuming I wouldn't be able to anyway.


[11-Dec-20 10:00 PM] Tofino#6999
wouldn't be able to install? or use DEX? DEX is working on my phone, but not on linux desktop


[11-Dec-20 10:01 PM] Tofino#6999
seem like only restricted on computers


[11-Dec-20 10:02 PM] Tofino#6999
btw, couldn't install on Android but iPhone app worked. You need tester accounts for both but it's easy


[11-Dec-20 10:02 PM] Zed#8377
Still .... NOT putting it on my phone just for a test.


[11-Dec-20 10:03 PM] Tofino#6999
I hear you


[11-Dec-20 10:03 PM] Tofino#6999
do you have vpn? want to give it a try?


[11-Dec-20 10:04 PM] Zed#8377
I just want someone from the team to answer my original question ... need to go get some sleep now .......
If I can't join in the test then I need to stop wasting my time.

Pinned a message.


[11-Dec-20 10:09 PM] Zed#8377
Thanks for the info - not going to setup a VPN just for this - and not sure if I'll have the time to re-install the special version ... should have known about it before I went though the work of the first install .......


[11-Dec-20 10:10 PM] Slyris#2880
You can use the `MaintenanceTool` to uninstall the current version and use the installation from the version above !


[11-Dec-20 10:10 PM] uak#6718
@Slyris see this is a very good use case for a command line argument so people can use a proxy with the official dex


[11-Dec-20 10:10 PM] Slyris#2880
Usually lambda users don't want to go with CLI, but i got you ;p


[11-Dec-20 10:25 PM] Tofino#6999
Thanks! That worked for me on Ubuntu. DEX is enabled now üëç


[11-Dec-20 10:26 PM] Zed#8377
Thanks for the MaintenanceTool tip - uninstalled / re-installed and the wallet was still intact - didn't have to set things up again ... DEX enabled here too ... thanks .....


[11-Dec-20 10:27 PM] Slyris#2880

I have balances in my wallets and it says that we will be using test coins. Does that mean that our balances won't be touched at all?


[11-Dec-20 11:48 PM] dudezmobi#1945

[11-Dec-20 11:48 PM] dudezmobi#1945

Hi! How to get Rick and morty?


[11-Dec-20 11:54 PM] criptobear#6402
there is only one bug bugging me: on android phone when i leave the phone down and i return to it after the display turns off i do the usual fingerprint access to android and atomicdex asks for my fingerprint then i do it and AtomicDex shuts down


[11-Dec-20 11:54 PM] CrisF#3405 (pinned)
`RICK` & `MORTY` **faucet**```https://www.atomicexplorer.com/#/faucet/rick

Just so I understand correctly. We are supposed to swap rick for morty to be eligible for the competition?


[12-Dec-20 12:44 AM] Dantemonion#1010
correct


[12-Dec-20 12:45 AM] t_dan#3334

there is huge amount for expresss swap


[12-Dec-20 12:51 AM] Jurjen#9294
Okay thank you @syl. I am not that active in the community, but loves open source as much as possible, open and anonymous decentralized organization structure, and decentralization idea,my feedback is. 1) it was a bit hard to find out about how to test. I received a one way pin from a channel here with the request to test, but I had to give my email address for prices. I don't like the idea of mixing centralized less anonymous things (email) with my anonymous wallet. It doesn't feel like the decentralized possibility and there are already a lot of initiatives were I just can join by signing from a wallet. So I had to find out about how to stress test by another way. 2) I am now testing. Two swaps takes already 27 minutes and are still at 0%. When I used a less decentralized dex a couple of years ago such as IDEX it was within a minute. I won't use it if it takes this long as in the test.

there's some decentralized emails already! ||offtopic: try at  unstopabble domains||

Every 30 seconds or so I hear maker order placed. That's it


[12-Dec-20 12:54 AM] rionnox#3470
I've performed a swap just now with Rick and Morty. The audio ; keeps saying maker order placed every 30 seconds üòï


[12-Dec-20 12:54 AM] Slyris#2880
@Jack. @naezith-work will help you for resolution settings


[12-Dec-20 12:54 AM] Slyris#2880
You can try to match order 1:1, there is lot of people making small order


[12-Dec-20 12:55 AM] Dantemonion#1010
could the DEX get a decentralized email feature, for some couple words seller-buyer

@naezith-work Are you windows 10? I think I have a fix

DAI/KMD 
ETH/ZEC
Both swaps failed


[12-Dec-20 12:55 AM] Slyris#2880
You don't need any email for using the DEX, it's just for the competition and it's informative


[12-Dec-20 12:55 AM] Jurjen#9294
Okay, where can I find them? I know some temporary email solutions. But I found metamask wallet sign in dapps a very nice way of how easy and decentralized way it could be

the email address collection is to stop bots from claiming prizes during stress test thats all. the dex doesn;t need email


[12-Dec-20 12:56 AM] Dantemonion#1010
alright alright


[12-Dec-20 12:57 AM] Jurjen#9294
Yes I know. But it was hard to find out about that. They main communication was about email and prizes instead of decentralized signing and stress test info. So that is just my feedback

{Reactions}
thanks 

[12-Dec-20 12:57 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah but as mentionned you didn't need any email during the creation of your wallet inside the mobile app


[12-Dec-20 12:57 AM] rionnox#3470

can you set your desktop scale down to 100%. I think yours is 150% or 200% at the moment. though I remember making it fit to all

also, try to do swaps at price 1:1, the swaps at the top of the list might be gone before your request makes it in, very competitive up there.

i used 4 base coins for my maker orders: BTC, BCH, LTC and KMD, all with the same spread
so to avoid BTC fees, you can use BCH, LTC or KMD to buy FIRO or any other coin

some of the top 5 are maker nodes run by team, who have reported their addresses - this is taken into account.

Do not worry - we will not change any rules - prize distribution was announced before and we will stick to it. Just trying to say that we will take care of all testers and not only top of top will get a prize. There will be many prizes sent out - also for the "small stressers".

[12-Dec-20 02:47 AM] Dantemonion#1010

[12-Dec-20 02:48 AM] smkhound#7640
if you dont log back in in time, swap fails, funds returned to participants

Swapping on mobile app is faster than swapping on desktop app.. my experience


[12-Dec-20 03:36 AM] smkhound#7640
literally defined by block time and confirmations, if there are a few fast blocks, swap will be fast. GUI makes no diff, unless you lower confs.

saw some DOGE/MORTY orders but many of the swap fail, like this one: https://dexapi.cipig.net/public/error.php?uuid=b3efc6ab-3da1-45b8-bd59-b06b682c69fc, simply because every transaction lower 1 DOGE is considered dust on the DOGE chain and is rejected... the above swap should have been 0.3 DOGE... that will not work

txn fees are paid in the respective coins. trading fees are paid by the taker in the coin they are selling


[12-Dec-20 05:08 AM] Enorm#6061
Hmm so AtomicDEX doesn't increase demand for KMD, or reduce supply of it, unless you trade in KMD pairs?


[12-Dec-20 05:09 AM] gcharang#6833
not directly. but, KMD is the most liquid coin and the most suited for atomicswaps because of dPoW, its users, etc., there are ideas to allow dexfee payment in KMD too


[12-Dec-20 05:11 AM] Enorm#6061
ok thx


[12-Dec-20 05:11 AM] Enorm#6061
Discount on fees when paying in KMD might be good


[12-Dec-20 05:11 AM] ca333#0333
@Enorm and in the near future DEX protocol gets extension where the protocol will use specific % of the DEX fees to "automagically" purchase KMD from DEX network and burn it - all through decentralized tech.

When you place an order the funds aren't locked? So you could place orders for more than you have in your wallet, and as they get filled the ones you don't have funds for will get cancelled or hang?


[12-Dec-20 05:13 AM] Enorm#6061
I guess that's what I should be testing üôÇ


[12-Dec-20 05:13 AM] ca333#0333
they will get cancelled automagically


[12-Dec-20 05:13 AM] ca333#0333
unless its a partial match


[12-Dec-20 05:14 AM] gcharang#6833
till an order is matched, the coins aren't locked. that is what allows you to place multiple orders using the same coins


[12-Dec-20 05:14 AM] gcharang#6833
you can use the same 1 kmd to place orders for  btc, eth, vrsc etc


[12-Dec-20 05:15 AM] gcharang#6833
the first one that matches removes the the volume matched from the previous order


[12-Dec-20 05:15 AM] Enorm#6061
Really nice feature! Excellent for stop limit orders when they come around


[12-Dec-20 05:15 AM] Enorm#6061
What happens if two of my trades hit the same block?


[12-Dec-20 05:16 AM] gcharang#6833
matching of orders isn't happening on the blockchain. its happening on a dedicated p2p network. just the one matching instantly cancels the other or atleast the part of it that was used up


[12-Dec-20 05:18 AM] Enorm#6061

automated tests are done by us all the time. but, there may be factors we can't take into account if all teh apps are running on data centers. we want the app to be able to be used everywhere in the world regardless of teh type of intyernet connection

count might also be refined to the exact window of the event, but dont worry full count for all events and time in between will be on display after all events are completed

got it. also, not just the mm2 <--> connection is being tested, but also the electrum servers etc.,
but your idea is good. maybe there can be special releases of atomicDEX that have auto order placers etc

When entering numbers into the text box, can't enter a zero if there is already a zero in front of the cursor (when clicking in the box, it would place the cursor behind the 0) Makes it easy to enter integers, but not decimal points

Rick blockchain and Morty blochains handle well all transaction. This is very good ? Do we know the TPS on these chains during the stress test ?

another thing... swaps failing with error `"taker_swap:693] Started_at time_dif over 60 14656"` means the clock of that node is not in sync... max 60s difference is allowed and that node has 14656 seconds... when clock is off, all swaps will fail/not start

How do you get test tokens for to swap?


[12-Dec-20 07:17 AM] ejuliano#8606
within the atomicdex wallet you can receive rick and morty test coins from faucet


[12-Dec-20 07:17 AM] ejuliano#8606
add rick and morty to your list first


[12-Dec-20 07:18 AM] maicero1996#2973
@ejuliano how many should i get


[12-Dec-20 07:18 AM] maicero1996#2973
cause i got 7 only of each


[12-Dec-20 07:19 AM] ejuliano#8606
that is enough, afaik


[12-Dec-20 07:20 AM] ejuliano#8606
you could probably get more... i don't know how much time in between you can access the faucet again


[12-Dec-20 07:20 AM] maicero1996#2973
aha i see


[12-Dec-20 07:21 AM] maicero1996#2973
what is the price of each coin of morty or rick/


[12-Dec-20 07:21 AM] vichiet#4058
No price it's a test coin


[12-Dec-20 07:22 AM] maicero1996#2973
so what the benifit from this


[12-Dec-20 07:22 AM] vichiet#4058
For the stresstest


[12-Dec-20 07:22 AM] maicero1996#2973
sorry my stupid question iam new


[12-Dec-20 07:22 AM] ejuliano#8606
the benefit is no risk of loss


[12-Dec-20 07:22 AM] vichiet#4058
No issue


[12-Dec-20 07:22 AM] maicero1996#2973
do i get prize for that?


[12-Dec-20 07:23 AM] vichiet#4058
Yes there are some prizes


[12-Dec-20 07:23 AM] ejuliano#8606
no worries, it was a good question @maicero1996 keep asking any questions...it's not a bad thing


[12-Dec-20 07:23 AM] vichiet#4058

[12-Dec-20 07:23 AM] ejuliano#8606

[12-Dec-20 07:25 AM] ejuliano#8606
one is like a raffle; another is  airdrop; another is leaderboard; plus there are random ad hoc opportunities during the livestream... so if you watch livestream at the same time as swap hours during the events you could win other prizes


[12-Dec-20 07:25 AM] maicero1996#2973
when i i get it


[12-Dec-20 07:26 AM] ejuliano#8606
make sure you're registered for the swap contest if you want prizes


[12-Dec-20 07:29 AM] maicero1996#2973
how to make sure ?

[12-Dec-20 08:20 AM] Raccoon#4621

Results based on no of swaps or random?


[12-Dec-20 09:07 AM] uak#6718
AFAIK there are different types of prizes, one of them is based on total swaps during all weekend


[12-Dec-20 09:09 AM] warliezdiaz#2564
Does it consider the value of swaps?


[12-Dec-20 09:10 AM] Artist#0765
What about the next one thats based on rick and morty as well?


[12-Dec-20 09:10 AM] uak#6718
no, because it's mostly done using worthless coins $morty and $rick


[12-Dec-20 09:10 AM] warliezdiaz#2564
Or I could put swaps worth 1 RICK or MORTY and let us say, I have 50 each so that would be a total of 100 swaps.

@uak the stress test is based on rick and morty only?


[12-Dec-20 09:13 AM] uak#6718
no, but it's easier, faster and cheaper to do them

swaps between rick and morty are tracked for event, but dont let that stop you from swapping other coins, or swapping outside the event.

[12-Dec-20 10:00 AM] Alana_CryptoGirl#2031
We didn't get EMC2 for the last event....


[12-Dec-20 10:00 AM] tolken#2655
@Slyris to coingirls question, is it safe to delete DB? For market makers, this directory could get quite bloated. Periodically purging old jobs should be safe right?


[12-Dec-20 10:01 AM] tolken#2655
Would it cause issues to delete while running Marketmaker, so long as the swap is finished?


[12-Dec-20 10:01 AM] rionnox#3470
On the live stream they mentioned we'd receive an airdrop for each event as a small reward. I've received nothing as of yet. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÜ


[12-Dec-20 10:02 AM] cipi#4502
@tolken if there are no failed swaps where you are still waiting for refund, you can remove the DB
but i would stop mm2, remove the entire dir and start again
but of course, you loose all swap history

@UrkoKurko in DM to @iazid


[12-Dec-20 10:04 AM] tolken#2655
@cipi thanks - I have a layer that tracks the history outside of MM2, so getting rid of the swap history should ultimately be fine. I would like to avoid shutting down if necessary. Removing all swaps (at once) would be good to avoid as well. I know you know where I‚Äôm coming from - wouldn‚Äôt want to delete everything, if there are ongoing swaps. Don‚Äôt really want to ‚Äòwait‚Äô for every swap to finish, before doing such a purge.


[12-Dec-20 10:04 AM] UrkoKurko#2567
So, its like 12 seed phrase or 24?

Is the stress test NOW? Are we hammering the DEX, or waiting for something? I'm confused


[12-Dec-20 10:09 AM] tolken#2655
@Landingz1 yes ongoing, stats just aren‚Äôt updating yet. So many swaps, stat servers melting.

ok, swapping like there's no tomorrow

will the exchange model be phased out with buys and sells bids? and move to a best price conversion style


[12-Dec-20 10:23 AM] cipi#4502
it's because it waits for a notarization for the incoming KMD transaction... you can disable it and eg set it to 5 confirmations, but you will loose the dPoW protection for the swap that way

not very easy for a cross chain atomic swap to happen with a best price conversion style. as you might know all the best price conversion dexes are single chain, swapping tokens or proxy(wrapped) tokens

there is no way to build a crosschain holding contract that can process a swap. most blockchains don't know anything about other blockchains.

it might be possible to do between two chains that have dPoW enabled. then, they both will be able to know the states of the other and a "best price conversion" swap might be possible. it needs research and till an implementation exists, we won't know for sure

It's not slow - it depends on blockchain confirmations, that's the idea of the atomic swap

2-3 minutes max

[12-Dec-20 11:00 AM] Monkins#5278
I see, I suppose you could have an Ethereum bridge / BTC bridge to your blockchain and hold 1:1 liquidiy tokens on your blockchain.  then in your eco system you can do the conversions, as the tokens should be arbitrage-ing them selves.  then convert back to the native blockchain through the bridge.  The price conversion would then be a convert and not an exchange?


[12-Dec-20 11:01 AM] tolken#2655
VRSC + KMD + AtomicDex will be breathtaking in that respect @Monkins

Stats reset at starter of last test, but they don‚Äôt stop - they keep adding even after it ends. It also has team member marketmakers in it from time to time, so it makes it a bit misleading as well.

[12-Dec-20 12:29 PM] moonshina#4819
I recommend finding a way to better sync your system.  This actually worries me a little about using the Dex. For event 3 I performed almost 550 swaps and I just refreshed moments ago and still my count is at 293. I'm not sure what would cause the discrepancy between reported statistics and using the DEX. But I would like to see better accuracy on the front end before I utilize the software. Congrats to any who managed to gain rewards. More than two hours of non stop clicking netted me 5 komodo.


[12-Dec-20 12:31 PM] moonshina#4819
I think the UI for atomicDex is very easy to manage and comfortable viewing. Perhaps some UI adjustments in the settings would be nice as some text and icons were too small


[12-Dec-20 12:31 PM] Johnny B.#9425
the stresstest site is not the "front end" its just for the test to visualize your trades on a leaderboard.


[12-Dec-20 12:35 PM] Jcharming#2693
Hey @moonshina was announced at the end of the last stream EMC2 rewards are getting batched before Event 4 with the Qtum rewards because Einstienium is dropping off a bigger cahce. 

Giving you an update if you made swaps rewards are coming.


[12-Dec-20 12:35 PM] moonshina#4819
THanks Johnny B. I'm trying to offer positive criticism. I understand that the data for test swaps was checked and uploaded in batches to not overload the server (as per livestream comments), that is why I waited so long to check again. After more than an hour it should have corrected itself. So imagine if instead this statistical data showed live swaps, or current market price etc, it would be concerning to me if this had such a delay in reporting or if it was never accurately portrayed.


[12-Dec-20 12:36 PM] Regnar#6164
Luckily all swaps are on the blockchain and have timestamps of when they happened (during the competition) so they could easily be audited if afterwards you feel there was a discrepency

I enjoyed watching the livestreams and participating (my wrist not so much lol) I'm now extending my experience to help improve Komodo which is what this is all about correct?


[12-Dec-20 12:36 PM] Johnny B.#9425
I guess, but we are not stress testing the analytics of the site, we are stressing the dex. So criticism towards the site seems pointless to me


[12-Dec-20 12:36 PM] tolken#2655
@moonshina I thought my stats were off too, but I was estimating from the wrong time (thought it started 30min prior) but in the end, the numbers lined up. Note swaps must be completed within that hour, not just initiated.


[12-Dec-20 12:36 PM] Jcharming#2693
They haven't QTUM rewards are getting batched before the Event 4 and EMC2 with them as well.  

Einsteinium offered up more rewards and is still linking them over to us.

@Jcharming I think it‚Äôs important to point out all issues. If the stats are wrong, that‚Äôs a poblem and may be an indication of some other problem.

Thannks Tolken! Yeah I was aware that the swap had to occur within the time frame. I started once the countddown for the event was up and continued for one hour. I'm not bitching here. I'm offering my experience. What does everyone feel about the UI? Alot of the text and numbers are quite small in different parts of the software and I couldn't find a way to adjust

I don't think stats are 'wrong' I'm pretty sure that this is a miscommuncation from the way we have to update stats on the stresstest site because of the crazy high volume of tx we have going on vs that we're tracking during swap hour vs that we flip stats back to 24 hours after stress test competition is complete.  

Will review though all the same.  Please DM me specific that I can carry back

not sure i understand you correct or what you trying to say - either way since xcat swaps are 100% blockchain validated and transparent your statement case `may be an indication of some other problem.` is precluded. Website statistics parsed from collection of set of maker DBs has nothing to do with DEX network or DEX operations as such. Admitted a glitch in stats visuals on such a website is possible - but please do not compare or put such website in relation to DEX network or operations. It is two different things - hope this clarified your concerns and and those who got concerned due to statement.

@ca333 anyone get your puzzle yet?


[12-Dec-20 12:45 PM] moonshina#4819
@Jcharming Would you mind providing the time to begin and end for event 3 statistics. That ways I can compare my order history during that time frame to the stats and make sure they are in fact coordinated. I'm NOT doing this to bitch about not getting a reward. I'm trying to find any problems on my end in case their IS a problem with data syncing


[12-Dec-20 12:46 PM] milik#0188
I have a question in my mind. If swaps take such time, how that other markets like Binance can make trading so fast? I may be missing a basic knowledge of blockchain tech.

[12-Dec-20 12:49 PM] tolken#2655
@ca333 All I was saying was that the website with stats was presented to the testers as a resource. There‚Äôs not a lot of clarity regarding what it represents. There are some fun prizes to incentivize testers with a leaderboard to show where they stand, but the leaderboard isn‚Äôt a constant nor does it have an explanation on the page. From one moment to another, it has shown team marketmakers, another moment it doesn‚Äôt. It resets at the start of a test session, but then doesn‚Äôt stop when it ends. It doesn‚Äôt revert to 24h totals, it just continues from the last test start period.

[12-Dec-20 12:52 PM] moonshina#4819
@Jcharming That didn't take long. The data is off, but so was I. Looks like I started a little early. Actual Swaps occurend between 6-7pm UTC were 316, Statistics for Stress Test Showed 293. A smaller margin of error than I thought, I was counting some prior because of time zone differences, my mistake. Still an 8% difference for reporting. Hope that was helpful


[12-Dec-20 12:52 PM] cipi#4502
Binance does not settle the trades on blockchain, it is all only on their servers in some databases... and you have to rely that they will send you the real coins, on blockchain, when you withdraw... the deposits and withdrawals on Binance are on blockchain, and they take long

i like how all of the numerology comes into play here. I turned 33 this year and my son turned 3. Year of enlightenment for the Great Awakening


[12-Dec-20 12:56 PM] Nora Gretz#0461
It is possible to enter the seed on AtomicDex Desktop keeping the the trade wallet on?


[12-Dec-20 12:57 PM] Slyris#2880
wow


[12-Dec-20 12:57 PM] milik#0188
actually u are right. they have withdraw limits for everyone.


[12-Dec-20 12:57 PM] ca333#0333
thank you for clarification and sharing the details @tolken and @moonshina - it helps us lot. 
The rewards distribution is based on result parsing from the team - in https://blog.komodoplatform.com/en/atomicdex-stress-test-contest-details/ we outlined prize structure. We will always ensure this is super provable fair and and there will be additional random bounties for various stress-testers. 

Website is mainly to keep track of swap/DEX activity during event which is main purpose and enable testers to see the pubkey in the list. Slight de-sync can be possible when for instance last parse/sync would increase stats but did not trigger due to event-time passed. Such constellation can happen as we use "batched" syncs. I.e. each N minutes process triggered. But either way, for price distribution and final results of stress-test we ensure it is reliable metric - data is transparent anyway.

@moonshina during last video i said "no digits" in seed and it is only "alpha string" - and in this specific video i showed hint object again which clarifies a doubt comment from first hint (vader photo).


[12-Dec-20 01:00 PM] Slyris#2880
Vader is an alpha male ahah


[12-Dec-20 01:01 PM] BoBot-LunaMaxi#8821
24 word seed or 12


[12-Dec-20 01:01 PM] Slyris#2880
Custom can be less than twelve

lol yeah I wastched you. I tried many strings with no number or symbols. I'm just learning javascript right now, is an alpha string the same a string? A string is text only, I'm guessing an alpha string is text only with no numbers or characters? Thanks for clarifying. In alpha string are spaces still included? Or no spaces in alpha string?

i will show AtomicDex to a friend, and introduce him to Komodo, crypto, ... Komodo made it so he can have a true atomic swap dex on his mobile phone... or his computer if he prefers.  Both if he really likes to use it!  But really, so simple enough to access, make phone swaps, and get used to the next generation.  Can play with test coins, and use the real ones.  :AtomicDEX: ü´Ç üî•

So, if someone knows your KMD address on AtomicDEX, they can lookup your other addresses for other coins?

just to clarify a bit about Komodo's history, I believe Komodo removed privacy features because the team understands that optional privacy doesn't work and mandatory privacy is the only way to go. And Pirate Chain, as a participant of the Komodo dPoW network, offers the strongest private digital currency with mandatory private-only transactions.


[12-Dec-20 04:01 PM] tolken#2655
@wookie I believe it had more to do with regulatory concerns and that Komodo was evolving into more of a platform for other chains to build onto.

we have things we are developing (as pirate, as well as the bpsaa) that will allow for payments in privacy currency without the person receiving it actually holding privacy coins. Also, pirate (and other privacy coins) being listed on dexs, having sub-atomic swaps, etc will also allow users to swap privacy currencies without the fear of being delisted

Secure Enclaves/SGX, to prevent people from looking at computations being performed, is this something you'll be looking at in the Future?


[12-Dec-20 04:28 PM] wookie#7663
That's not possible. BPSAA is incorporated as a private organization. Being a non-profit organization just grants us opportunities to raise funds to provide public education and awareness. There is nothing that ties the BPSAA to any federal organization and certainly not any governmental agenda.


[12-Dec-20 04:29 PM] wookie#7663
Can you clarify what you mean by "directional globalitic"?


[12-Dec-20 04:30 PM] CrisF#3405
> allow for payments in privacy currency without the person receiving it actually holding privacy coins
The power and potential of this is massive.


[12-Dec-20 04:31 PM] Dantemonion#1010
as the BPSAA aims to create and promote certain conditions of security, decentralization, cooperation, economical behaviours and so on, that vision tends to take over world as an enviroment. So, that's I call globalitic, in contrast from politic, that is limited to local or metro areas

The BPSAA promotes security in terms of protection from unwelcome intruders/hackers. We promote interoperability between member projects as an alliance to harness on the power of the brain trust we've accumulated. Decentralization is promoted heavily by crypto overall, it is important to the industry and but is not a primary focus of the BPSAA's efforts.
With regards to "economic behavior", do you mean our focus on privacy? Our goal is not to "take over the world" in any way. "Privacy" is important and a fundamental aspect of humanity, so we see promoting it as something as important as using the safety belt in a car, wearing a helmet when one rides a bicycle. As I mentioned at the beginning of this hour, CBDCs are basically a given thing that will happen in the next few years. With this new form of transparent currency, learning about and how to perform safe practices with privacy is akin to teaching people about wearing seatbelts in cars or airplanes when they first came about.

Completely agree with what @Reuben (Firo) said.
Privacy before was always about personal usage and has been so easy to give away in return for convenience
Humanity has never had transparent money before. Cash is truly anonymous. Credit cards, to a certain extent is still behind the wall of the financial institution/bank. Transparent digital money has a lot of implications, many of which is still not anticipated. But from what we know based on the history and certainly the past 2 decades since the rise of Google and Facebook, personal choices is a tool by both private and governmental institutions. 
Private: when you walk through the liquor store everyday, or go to the liquor website, the Facebook/google app on your phone only knows that you're visiting it. But you may not be buying anything (or buy with cash in the store), they don't know beyond your location. But now that you're buying with transparent digital currency, now they will know what you buy. And your spending choice has more value than your "window shopping" time.

how do you address that on one hand like you said, zsnarks math was so complex the vuln was not likely exposed, yours is less known than the zcash forks and usages.  if the math is complex to that degree, wouldnt less people understand or be exposed to yours?

One of the main points that impresses me with the BPSAA is that it brings together projects with quite different approaches towards a common goal and addressing the same major issue.  For me it's not the method that is used so much, as it is to reach the final goal.  Privacy.

Hi


[12-Dec-20 05:59 PM] wookie#7663
@Reuben (Firo) Coming back to the idea of the original cypherpunk movement that you mentioned earlier. 
Satoshi's vision was about a currency for the people. 
Governments and regulators should be governing for the people, the people's choice to protect personal financial privacy should not have to be compromised just to be built around the regulator's rules.

As @wookie just said, Privacy by default.
With that, and the individual having the option to reveal about themselves what they choose, there is a very worthy goal to work towards.
And it's a goal far larger, and imo more important than, the (financial) success of any particular project.
That's where the BPSAA comes in to things, in my view.

audo is anyone managing the social media channels?

I heard the person who managed the twitter account has family problems at the moment

that is unfortunate but do we have someone else that can help? I thought i would get non stop tagging but been very quiet

Faucet will get you enough to swap. If you want more, put a maker order up for KMD, I'm sure someone will fill it (note: RICK and MORTY are test coins, and only have sentimental value)

Works better then yesterday 1st test. I started 3 swaps on Android app. 1st finished in around 4 minutes, 2nd and 3th take around 6 minutes


[13-Dec-20 04:37 AM] Jurjen#9294
But still to long in my opinion


[13-Dec-20 04:39 AM] cipi#4502
blocktime on RICK/MORTY chain is 1 minute and it takes couple transactions to perform the swap, so it takes couple minutes üôÇ


[13-Dec-20 04:40 AM] Alright#0419
a dpow enabled swap will take significantly longer even


[13-Dec-20 04:40 AM] Jurjen#9294
Okay, so when I swap bitcoin this way, it can take hours?

Generally expect 4-6 blocktimes for swap with 1 confirm.


[13-Dec-20 04:42 AM] gcharang#6833
here, the coins are never at risk as opposed to handing over your coins to a centralized exchange

[13-Dec-20 04:43 AM] Jurjen#9294
Still it is far from ready what someone told me that it would be the future that it didn't matter which coins you have, if you travel by bus and bus company is using their own token you can just pay and it will swap


[13-Dec-20 04:43 AM] Jurjen#9294

A cex is a glorified horse betters notebook. You owe this to him and he owes this to me and so forth. Having a spreadsheet of balances


[13-Dec-20 04:45 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Vs actually owning the coins and actually having them in YOUR wallet


[13-Dec-20 04:45 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Trades will always take time, and it will always depend on the blockchain

Yes I know


[13-Dec-20 04:45 AM] Alright#0419
There are ways to do something along those lines. Barterdex(predecessor to atomicDex) had a feature like this. It involves locking some amount of funds in an escrow however


[13-Dec-20 04:46 AM] Alright#0419
lock $100 of funds, make as many concurrent instant swaps as that is worth

mm2 RAM on a unix machine increased from 200MB to about 3.3GB after 24h


[13-Dec-20 04:56 AM] CrisF#3405
Would that mean that Blur will also be atomic swap-able?


[13-Dec-20 04:56 AM] Dmitry#3146
what is the airdrop based on? on the number of swaps?

yes, once monero is implemented, blur addition will be just a config file update

I pull orderbooks on all pairs each 10 minutes aswell on that node...

Direct integration with Ravencoin's asset platform would be better.  Otherwise there would be config needed for every token.

The RIP11 encrypted data is on-chain already. No swap needed. But you are right that RIP11 can be used for encrypted transaction meta-data.  @Deleted User


[13-Dec-20 05:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
right, that is what I should have clarified.   a 2nd function not for the DEX....   but I would luv to see it used for login identification.  No more passwords...

Absolutely.  We can't access your wallet on AtomicDEX because it's all non-custodial.  However we can use analytics processes to determine what your other pub addresses by their association to creation of your AtomicDEX KMD addy. 
So as long as we have your AtomicDEX KMD address we can rain rewards into your AtomicDEX all day.

how long before a swap times out?


[13-Dec-20 08:52 AM] gcharang#6833
depends on the coins involved. block times and notarizations etc


[13-Dec-20 08:53 AM] gcharang#6833
also, the response time of the maker node


[13-Dec-20 08:53 AM] BoBot-LunaMaxi#8821
rick and morty , did a swap on mobile and phone went off so swap is stuck inprogress for 54 mins

What about KMD swap, it always takes more than 30minutes for me


[13-Dec-20 09:54 AM] daemonfox#6136
Swap to which coin?


[13-Dec-20 09:55 AM] daemonfox#6136
Swaps are at t eh mercy of the blockchain swapping to as well... so BTC could be 30 mins for 3 blocks to pass


[13-Dec-20 09:55 AM] gcharang#6833
you can select "no dpow/no notarization" for the swap. but, it will be less secure


[13-Dec-20 09:55 AM] structi#6733
hƒ±mm, no something strange here

What is the dangerous part here? Sending coin and not receiving coin?


[13-Dec-20 09:59 AM] structi#6733
For example: swapping 36k KMD with 1 BTC. if I select no dpow, is there any situation sending KMD and not receiving BTC?


[13-Dec-20 10:00 AM] gcharang#6833
yes, if a 51% attack(double spend) is happening, a transaction previously thought of as confirmed might become unconfirmed or even invalid. dPoW protects against that


[13-Dec-20 10:00 AM] gcharang#6833
if you are sending kmd, it shouldn't affect you. unless you decrease the number of confirmations of bitcoin

[13-Dec-20 11:28 AM] Jcharming#2693

We've landed an exclusive distribution opportunity on the results of this stress test from Dec 12-13.  
**What this means**  Komodo Platform marketing team promises we won't publicly publish the results of our key findings until the exclusive offer has expired while this pitched opportunity for reporters from major outlets to pick it up exists. 

We're opting to take it as this media op highly increases the chances of getting this event & info picked up - offer expires end of January, after which marketing will be be publishing our media articles around it and pushing out on media channels.
