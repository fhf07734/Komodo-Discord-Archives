would be good to get a channel anyway to keep everything in one place, I'll probs come back with regular questions regarding the reward claiming
we hit a little road block with the app, it turns out the current official KMD app implements BTC consensus rule checks on the TX before signing
and having an output amount larger than the input amount violates this and causes the Ledger to throw an error
You can see the function here: https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-btc/blob/master/src/btchip_transaction.c#L48-L71

For more context it's called from here: https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-btc/blob/master/src/main.c#L1987

I've "fixed" this with a pretty simple hack here: https://github.com/lukechilds/ledger-app-btc/commit/e2ebcada593710faf8f438bd26d21a170a3b60d4
GitHub
Allow Ledger to sign Komodo reward claim transactions ¬∑ lukechild...

it works, and bypasses the check for KMD
However the txfee amounts shown to the user now overflow for reward claim transactions
I wanted to implement the reward amount calculations on the device but:
1) It is completely incompatible with the current BTC protocol coin codebase
2) I'm almost certain Ledger won't accept a PR with all that code

[19-Oct-18 04:56 AM] jl777c#5810
The device has no concept of UTXO height or current block height, it just knows about inputs and outputs and signs them. So we'd need to completely fork the BTC app, add support for passing block height info to the Ledger, implement all the KMD interest consensus rules on the device, and then fork their API client and add the block height support to that too. :/
so the current solution is preferable to that
just force allowing any output amount
Just wanted your opinion on if this change is ok, I don't think it should have any negative effects
The only down side I can see is, if the outputs are larger than the inputs the txfee value overflows so it displays the txfee as like a bazillion KMD
but that would only ever happen if the output amount is larger than the input amount
e.g with an reward claim TX
normal TXs will show up fine
so no normal software is likely to encounter this
worst case scenario possible, someone accidentally crafts a TX that has way more outputs than inputs and sends it to the ledger to sign, the Ledger signs it without error, then they broadcast it to the network and it gets rejected instantly
no loss of funds
it will just sign TXs that break the consensus rules in the single scenario that the outputs are too large
I think
but yeah, I'm a little out of my depth, I'm not very familiar with C at all
so would be great to get your opinion on that
and also if you or anyone else can see an obvious way to not make the txfee overflow so we can show negative fees like on explorers rather that ridiculously high numbers that would be great too

Great work @lukechilds üòÉ


[19-Oct-18 05:35 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe one way is to have two different claim functions? one for old rule utxo and one for new?


[19-Oct-18 05:35 AM] jl777c#5810
or it could try the oldrules and if error, then use the new rules


[19-Oct-18 05:36 AM] jl777c#5810
as far as how GUI displays negative numbers,that seems up to the GUI side of things


[19-Oct-18 05:41 AM] lukechilds#2707
sorry, should have been more clear, regarding calculating the claim amounts, that all happens in the web app, the Ledger device has nothing to do with that.

It's not the GUI displaying a negative number, it's the actual Ledger device itself. It overflows negative numbers as their store as an `unsigned char`:  https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-btc/blob/master/src/btchip_transaction.c#L48-L71

[19-Oct-18 05:41 AM] lukechilds#2707
you can see in that example ‚òù


[19-Oct-18 05:41 AM] jl777c#5810
that is a bit distressing


[19-Oct-18 05:42 AM] lukechilds#2707
lol


[19-Oct-18 05:42 AM] lukechilds#2707
The input amount is 15 KDM and the output amount is 16 KMD


[19-Oct-18 05:42 AM] lukechilds#2707
so it should be -1 KMD


[19-Oct-18 05:42 AM] lukechilds#2707
but overflows to that huge number


[19-Oct-18 05:42 AM] jl777c#5810
but the sum of inputs is really less than sum of outputs, so it is a negative fee using normal rules


[19-Oct-18 05:42 AM] jl777c#5810
but if it works ok and the explorer shows it, maybe its a feature?


[19-Oct-18 05:43 AM] jl777c#5810
when you see big giant txfee, that means you claimed!


[19-Oct-18 05:43 AM] lukechilds#2707
Yeah, they can check out output amounts on the device


[19-Oct-18 05:43 AM] lukechilds#2707
so as long as those are correct, the user can safely ignore the txfee


[19-Oct-18 05:43 AM] lukechilds#2707
only thing I'm worried about is Ledger not being happy about that and not accepting our PR


[19-Oct-18 05:44 AM] lukechilds#2707
but this would never happen with a normal TX using Ledger's KMD wallet


[19-Oct-18 05:44 AM] lukechilds#2707
so they might not notice


[19-Oct-18 05:44 AM] jl777c#5810
can your pull request change their display code too?


[19-Oct-18 05:44 AM] jl777c#5810
but they likely wont notice


[19-Oct-18 05:45 AM] jl777c#5810
and i doubt users would complain if it is explained to them so they dont get a heart attack


[19-Oct-18 05:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
Yeah definitely, but I'm worried if I change to much, they also won't accept the PR. Not sure if your familiar with the codebase but BTC and all BTC style coins use a shared codebase with some if checks for different alts.

So if we had a few lines wrapped in an if check for KMD, (like it is now) they'll likely accept. If we go and rewrite large portions of the codebase that effects all currencies (the tx fee display) just to fix a bug in a very specific use case for one alt coin, I think they're much less likely to accept.


[19-Oct-18 05:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
so I'd rather try and sneak this in first


[19-Oct-18 05:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
if they have an issue, then we can look at fixing it and see if they're open to accepting it


[19-Oct-18 05:48 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, i doubt they will care if the display shows overflow, they dont really seem to care much at all


[19-Oct-18 06:01 AM] lukechilds#2707
but regarding fixing that bug, i'm pretty far out of my comfort zone with all this C stuff, do you have any ideas?

It's the function that calculates the txfee here: https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-btc/blob/master/src/btchip_transaction.c#L48-L71
The first argument `target` is the txfee. It's an `unsigned char` which seems confusing to me as it's a number. After some reading it seems an `unsigned char` is an ascii character AKA a number in the range 0...255 AKA an 8-bit integer.

So I'm not sure how it's getting interpreted as that huge number. I tried changing into a `signed char` which I thought might allow negative numbers but got the same issue. Maybe because `255` is hardcoded into the calculations as they're expecting it to be limited to 0...255?

its doing a long subtract one char at a time


[19-Oct-18 06:03 AM] jl777c#5810
pointer to unsigned char, ie. array of them


[19-Oct-18 06:04 AM] jl777c#5810
it is overflowing into a negative number 0xf... which becomes 186...


[19-Oct-18 06:05 AM] jl777c#5810
the math is correct


[19-Oct-18 06:05 AM] jl777c#5810
the problem is the display of the negative number


[19-Oct-18 06:05 AM] jl777c#5810
well, maybe the math isnt correct, it is a bit tricky, but regardless negative fee will be a binary with MSB set


[19-Oct-18 06:06 AM] jl777c#5810
if you can do an if "KMD" and txfee is negative then display "reward claimed"


[19-Oct-18 06:06 AM] jl777c#5810
but of course that is a dream


[19-Oct-18 06:06 AM] jl777c#5810
i think it is ok as it is, certainly much better than what we have now!


[19-Oct-18 06:07 AM] lukechilds#2707
That's a good idea actually


[19-Oct-18 06:07 AM] lukechilds#2707
but yeah, not sure they'll go for that


[19-Oct-18 06:07 AM] lukechilds#2707
that could be a good option if they have an issue with the negative fees though


[19-Oct-18 06:08 AM] lukechilds#2707
but ok, what you say makes sense, I'll have a look into the display code and see if I can fiddle with anything there

thanks üëç


[19-Oct-18 06:15 AM] jl777c#5810
for the first pull request, just ignore the overflow, it seems harmless


[19-Oct-18 06:15 AM] jl777c#5810
and ledger wont notice or care


[19-Oct-18 06:16 AM] jl777c#5810
it only happens to KMD, which they actively ignore for a year and thousands of customer requests


[19-Oct-18 06:16 AM] jl777c#5810
i doubt they value the sanctity of their positve txfee display

@lukechilds just want to make sure you are using integer math and truncating the numbers in the calcs. Agama had a bug due to using floating point and the fractional amount multiplied out bigger than allowed

Sup guys noob question again.... Where does the 5.1% rewards come from?


[19-Oct-18 06:43 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
The supply which is not out yet


[19-Oct-18 06:43 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Total ever going to be around 200mil


[19-Oct-18 06:44 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Current circulation is around 102mill?? Something like that


[19-Oct-18 06:44 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
It is mined and the majority of that goes to 5.1 rewards

[21-Oct-18 09:59 PM] lukechilds#2707
@jl777c thanks for the heads up, all numbers are floating point by default in JS. I will write a comprehensive test suite to ensure all calculations are correct. Is there an accurate JS implementation of the reward calculations in Agama I can use for reference?

-= 59 is needed


[22-Oct-18 01:58 AM] jl777c#5810
calcs need to use exact values from C code to be exact


[22-Oct-18 02:04 AM] lukechilds#2707
right, but there's no 777 in the C code and the `-= 59` is wrapped in a conditional in the C version


[22-Oct-18 02:07 AM] lukechilds#2707
Also, I had assumed the calculations would consider time as 1 block equals 1 minute, regardless of what the real world time difference is.

The JS code is using the system clock. Is that correct? I'm not too sure about the C code, I'm not too familiar with C


[22-Oct-18 02:15 AM] jl777c#5810
time() is the unixtime from system clock


[22-Oct-18 02:15 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure the question about the 777, if the C code doesnt have it and you do, then it would claim slightly less


[22-Oct-18 02:16 AM] jl777c#5810
which is pretty harmless and provides a buffer for any small calc differences


[22-Oct-18 02:42 AM] lukechilds#2707
as far as I can see, `time()` isn't used anywhere in the interest calculations


[22-Oct-18 02:42 AM] lukechilds#2707
so it's using block height as time, is that correct?

with the scriptPubKey 20 bytes rmd160


[24-Oct-18 03:39 AM] lukechilds#2707
so does that mean the signature is invalid?


[24-Oct-18 03:44 AM] jl777c#5810
dont know, it aborted after it saw that the RMD160 mismatched. well I guess since that is the case, there is no way the signature was valid

maybe you can test with p2pk vout? that has less to go wrong


[24-Oct-18 03:46 AM] jl777c#5810
just the signature is needed

There's no way to sign a P2PK tx with the Ledger

[24-Oct-18 03:50 AM] jl777c#5810
why did you put 03e595e6e348e8d8571eef291a2bda3f4d5ee9c7be1d36991108a9815e86b9ed26 in the scriptSig?


[24-Oct-18 04:01 AM] lukechilds#2707
I didn't, that's generated by the Ledger library, I pass it the previous transaction and the output index for the UTXO I'm spending.  The the BIP 44 derivation path for the privkey. And the output script. The library forms the transaction and sends it to the device to be signed.


[24-Oct-18 04:13 AM] jl777c#5810
do you know the pubkey for: RQm8BNygniNVqVPRYXEosznRZ7uEiooqSm


[24-Oct-18 04:21 AM] lukechilds#2707
I own that address so yeah, I can find it, however if you're thinking maybe I'm using the wrong output I don't think that's it. There are two outputs and I'm using `0` which I'm confident is the correct one. I just tried changing it to `1` to quickly test and then I get:

are you able to make spends at all, with or without rewards

No, just tried with the same value as the input, same error


[24-Oct-18 05:15 AM] lukechilds#2707

[24-Oct-18 05:17 AM] lukechilds#2707
I thought a TX contained the pubkey for inputs you're signing, and that was how you verify the signature, is that not correct?


[24-Oct-18 05:20 AM] jl777c#5810
not a p2pkh that has the hash of the pubkey so you need to have the signature and the pubkey on the stack via scriptSig to allow the OP_EQUALVERIFY against the p2pkh scriptPubKey


[24-Oct-18 05:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
I know the recipient address is the hash of the pubkey for a P2PKH TX but I thought when you spend a P2PKH input you need to include your pubkey in the TX. How else can you verify it? And how do you "have the signature and the pubkey on the stack" without including the pubkey in the TX?


[24-Oct-18 05:29 AM] lukechilds#2707
I just checked, it does.
The `RQm8BNygniNVqVPRYXEosznRZ7uEiooqSm` pubkey is included in the raw TX I linked above. That was going `RQm8BNygniNVqVPRYXEosznRZ7uEiooqSm` -> `RMqevVxyUkgJdSqYEKj5CK4XcX5UvqFsyj `


[24-Oct-18 05:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
In the `scriptSig.asm`:

```
3044022022047c84f9dc59d57d54022b3a9aa61db2f78bea8edd513befacfb55439e560b02202d5b74c539b17a1785b10084556249fc9882778b8cf593a1eaaece6e6e2cc7e501 03e595e6e348e8d8571eef291a2bda3f4d5ee9c7be1d36991108a9815e86b9ed26
```

is everything after the space the stack?


[24-Oct-18 05:48 AM] lukechilds#2707
and in a normal P2PKH TX will that always be only the pubkey?

Thanks, I'll raise this on the Ledger dev slack


[25-Oct-18 07:08 AM] luke#8628
Hey! Do I understand this correctly for how the DEX rewards are paid out?

1. Every time an atomic swap happens in BarterDEX, a 0.15% fee is charged to the Taker in the currency they are sending.
2. That fee is sent to an address in that currency owned by someone at Komodo 
3. Once enough fees are collected, the fees are converted into KMD.
4. Once "accumulated amount is of 1$ million worth of revshares" a payout occurs, and everyone gets a percentage of the fees returned to them.

My questions are 1. how do you know what addresses to send the reward KMD to? 2. how do you know how much to send to each address?


[25-Oct-18 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
a snapshot of the DEX blockchain is made

@jl777c I got the incorrect pubkey issue working but I'm nw getting this when trying to broadcast the TX

```
16: mandatory-script-verify-flag-failed (Script evaluated without error but finished with a false/empty top stack element). Code:-26
```

What does this error mean? That the signature is invalid? I‚Äôm definitely passing the correct derivation path for the input to the Ledger and the pubkey in `scriptSig` matches the pubkey for the input. Any ideas?


[31-Oct-18 01:53 AM] jl777c#5810
it means the signature was not valid. either you are signing the incorrect sigtxid or using the wrong privkey


[31-Oct-18 02:06 AM] lukechilds#2707
That's really odd, as far as I can see I'm definitely using the correct privkey


[31-Oct-18 02:06 AM] lukechilds#2707
there are no hardcoded values, I'm requesting the address from the Ledger device, looking up the available UTXOs on insight, and then sending them to the same address

does anything stand out to you as obviously wrong?

This is going from `RMqevVxyUkgJdSqYEKj5CK4XcX5UvqFsyj` to `RMqevVxyUkgJdSqYEKj5CK4XcX5UvqFsyj` which is the address for the derivation path `"44'/141'/0'/0/0"` on my Ledger.

The Ledger shows the pubkey as `04e4f4b2a6fc1b0b04ae652a961658802c94ffdbe5203ff45466b583c2ac6ec4eb56aaf9d686b1f2035f9f45e63fa156a1bea03cdd67bf20d1735a9cb36c3632c8` which when compressed is `02e4f4b2a6fc1b0b04ae652a961658802c94ffdbe5203ff45466b583c2ac6ec4eb` which matches the pubkey in `scriptSig`.

locktime isnt set


[31-Oct-18 02:24 AM] jl777c#5810
the signing is against a modified tx, I call it is sigtxid, which takes the scriptSig and puts the scriptPubKey there of the entire tx, including nLockTime


[31-Oct-18 02:24 AM] jl777c#5810
if part of the code things nLockTime is set and created the sigtxid based on that, you are signing the wrong sigtxid


[31-Oct-18 02:24 AM] jl777c#5810
signing things properly is the biggest painfullest thing there is


[31-Oct-18 02:51 AM] lukechilds#2707
Yep, learning that the hard way


[31-Oct-18 02:52 AM] lukechilds#2707
From what I understood I thought locktime was required for the UTXO to accrue rewards, but a TX is still valid without it, it just won't accrue rewards


[31-Oct-18 02:52 AM] lukechilds#2707
is that incorrect?


[31-Oct-18 02:52 AM] lukechilds#2707
I was leaving out locktime for now because I just wanted to get the simplest TX possible signed by the Ledger


[31-Oct-18 02:53 AM] lukechilds#2707
I just tried setting the locktime parameter in the Ledger library to 777, the resulting signed TX looks different but still gets rejected with the same error


[31-Oct-18 02:57 AM] jl777c#5810
it is still valid


[31-Oct-18 02:58 AM] jl777c#5810
the vin is a p2pkh and the pubkey matches, and the error indicates it is past the pubkey check, so the signature is failing


[31-Oct-18 02:59 AM] jl777c#5810
the three possible ways it can fail is invalid signature from valid privkey, invalid privkey, the wrong thing is being signed


[31-Oct-18 02:59 AM] jl777c#5810
the first would be rare and doubt it is happening with an already working system


[31-Oct-18 02:59 AM] jl777c#5810
second is likely not the issue as i am assuming the same automatic mechanism that is adding the pubkey is doing the signing, and they are a matched pair


[31-Oct-18 03:00 AM] jl777c#5810
which means it is most likely the sigtxid being wrong and likely it wont printout what it is actually signing, but that is the next step to see what the sigtxid it is signing is and compare it to what it should be

[31-Oct-18 03:09 AM] lukechilds#2707
Do you think it would be useful to dump the privkey from the Ledger, try and create and sign a transaction on my machine using the same key/UTXO and see if it it's valid


[31-Oct-18 03:09 AM] lukechilds#2707
then if it is compare the two


[31-Oct-18 03:09 AM] lukechilds#2707
that might give us some pointers where the Ledger TX is going wrong


[31-Oct-18 03:19 AM] jl777c#5810
signatures are non-deterministic, but if you can sign it on your system, then that eliminates the second issue and makes it pretty certain that the sigtxid is the problem


[31-Oct-18 04:13 AM] lukechilds#2707
Manually crafting the TX on my machine works and doesn't get rejected

What do you mean by "signatures are non-deterministic"?

That the same input will result in a different signature? Because on the Ledger and on my machine, the same input results in the same output each time.


[31-Oct-18 04:19 AM] jl777c#5810
well, it depends on the entropy that is input, it could be deterministic


[31-Oct-18 04:19 AM] jl777c#5810
based on a specific implementation


[31-Oct-18 04:19 AM] jl777c#5810
but this indicates the ledger is signing the wrong rawtx


[31-Oct-18 04:40 AM] lukechilds#2707

[31-Oct-18 04:40 AM] lukechilds#2707
I was manually creating the output script for the ledger TX

nLicktime needs to be a unixtimestamp


[31-Oct-18 05:32 AM] lukechilds#2707
why is nLocktime required btw?


[31-Oct-18 05:32 AM] lukechilds#2707
I don't quite understand


[31-Oct-18 05:33 AM] lukechilds#2707
why can't all UTXOs be claimed and just use the block height they were confirmed as their age


[31-Oct-18 05:52 AM] jl777c#5810
speed


[31-Oct-18 05:53 AM] jl777c#5810
things are slow enough as it is, without required block lookups


[31-Oct-18 05:53 AM] jl777c#5810
CCduration uses the timestamp in the block


[31-Oct-18 06:20 AM] lukechilds#2707
but `txheight` is already used in quite a few places in the interest calculations


[31-Oct-18 06:22 AM] lukechilds#2707
so instead of

```
minutes= (tiptime - nLockTime) / 60)
```

it would be

```
minutes= (tipheight - txheight)
```


[31-Oct-18 06:23 AM] jl777c#5810
at the time i couldnt be 100% sure in the accuracy, also height difference only approximates minutes


[31-Oct-18 06:23 AM] jl777c#5810
anyway, it is done and consensus is based on this, to change it would break consensus and create an entire update, for minimal gains


[31-Oct-18 06:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
yeah, not advocating to change it, just wanted to understand why it's like this


[31-Oct-18 06:24 AM] jl777c#5810
it was done years ago


[31-Oct-18 06:25 AM] jl777c#5810
before I had a 100% assured way of having the block timestamp


[31-Oct-18 06:25 AM] jl777c#5810
also, it allows to implement mempool expiration without changing tx serialization


[31-Oct-18 06:55 AM] lukechilds#2707
ok


[31-Oct-18 06:56 AM] lukechilds#2707
and re setting the nLocktime to a unix timestamp


[31-Oct-18 06:56 AM] lukechilds#2707
can I just use the current time or should it be slightly in the future?


[31-Oct-18 06:57 AM] lukechilds#2707
is there a threshold where a nLocktime is too old and it won't get mined or will be rejected?


[31-Oct-18 06:59 AM] jl777c#5810
slightly in the past


[31-Oct-18 06:59 AM] jl777c#5810
cant be more than an hour in the past


[31-Oct-18 06:59 AM] lukechilds#2707
ok


[31-Oct-18 07:01 AM] lukechilds#2707
doesn't that mean someone can just set nLocktime to 59 minutes in the past and claim after 5 minutes and rinse and repeat?


[31-Oct-18 07:02 AM] lukechilds#2707
or I guess that is what the `minutes -= 59;` is for in the interest function


[31-Oct-18 07:03 AM] lukechilds#2707
but it still means you don't have to wait an hour to start accruing rewards like most normal users if you manually set nLocktime just under an hour in the past, right?


[31-Oct-18 07:09 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[31-Oct-18 07:10 AM] jl777c#5810
we had a compound interest attack that did that


[31-Oct-18 07:10 AM] jl777c#5810
so there is a one hour setback


[31-Oct-18 07:12 AM] lukechilds#2707
awww


[31-Oct-18 07:12 AM] lukechilds#2707

The Ledger reward claiming app will be a third party app


[01-Nov-18 09:46 AM] lukechilds#2707
development should be finished this month but not sure how long it will take for Ledger to approve the changes to the KMD Ledger app


[01-Nov-18 09:52 AM] lukechilds#2707
Btw, I think there are some errors here:
https://komodoplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KPSD/pages/71729215/What+is+the+5+Komodo+Stake+Reward

```
The 5% reward starts accumulating after a few minutes if you hold over 10 KMD in your wallet.
```

It will more likely be around an hour not a few minutes if nLockTime is set slightly in the past.

```
It is very similar to POS 
```
And then in the next line:
```
KMD's POS is a hybrid zero footprint proof of stake
```

These two statements seem to contradict each other, saying it's **similar** to PoS and then saying it **is** PoS then saying it's **hybrid** PoS.

Also, it's completely unrelated to PoS, it's not a consensus mechanism. I think the comparison to PoS is confusing, PoS should either not be mentioned at all, or only be mentioned purely to explain that Komodo is not PoS and KMD rewards are nothing to do with stake rewards.

@jl777c just FYI, in the first transaction I set nLocktime to 777 instead of a timestamp in error.

However it was accepted by the network and confirmed in a block. Shouldn't  777 as a unix timestamp be evaluated as 01/01/1970 @ 12:12am (UTC)?

Which should be rejected?

@lukechilds nlocktime is just a limit on the earliest time a transaction can be included in a block


[02-Nov-18 01:23 AM] lukechilds#2707
@Alright I'm aware of that, but I mistakenly set it to 777, which as a unix timestamp evaluates to 01/01/1970 @ 12:12am. The network is supposed to reject transactions older than one hour. So I'm wondering how that transaction was accepted.


[02-Nov-18 01:30 AM] Alright#0419
pm'd you


[02-Nov-18 02:21 AM] jl777c#5810
anything less than 500 mil is treated as height and the interest calc will ignore it


[02-Nov-18 02:53 AM] lukechilds#2707
Yeah, just figured that out in my testing, `nLockTime >= LOCKTIME_THRESHOLD` to the rescue


[02-Nov-18 02:54 AM] lukechilds#2707
btw @jl777c what happens if the client interest calcs are slightly under the `komodod` calcs?


[02-Nov-18 02:54 AM] lukechilds#2707
say the client is under by 100 sats


[02-Nov-18 02:54 AM] lukechilds#2707
does the miner calculate the interest and realise there are an extra unused 100 sats and credit it to himself in the block reward?


[02-Nov-18 02:55 AM] lukechilds#2707
or are those 100 sats just never minted?


[02-Nov-18 03:53 AM] jl777c#5810
miner gets unclaimed interest


[02-Nov-18 04:46 AM] lukechilds#2707
Thanks


[02-Nov-18 04:46 AM] lukechilds#2707
oh and one more thing


[02-Nov-18 04:46 AM] lukechilds#2707
If you set nLocktime more than an hour in the past the TX gets rejected


[02-Nov-18 04:47 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[02-Nov-18 04:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
is that a normal BTC rule


[02-Nov-18 04:47 AM] jl777c#5810
no


[02-Nov-18 04:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
or was that added to KMD due to the supply infaltion bug


[02-Nov-18 04:47 AM] jl777c#5810
BTC allows any time from the past


[02-Nov-18 04:47 AM] jl777c#5810
it was added to prevent the backdating of utxo, also it achieves mempool expiration


[02-Nov-18 04:48 AM] jl777c#5810
so after an hour if you tx isnt confirmed you dont have to worry about it confirming sometime in the next week


[02-Nov-18 04:49 AM] lukechilds#2707
Can you expand on mempool expiration a little? I'm not quite sure I understand


[02-Nov-18 04:50 AM] lukechilds#2707
oh you just mean if it doesn't get confirmed in an hour, it won't be floating around in the mempool for an unkonwn amount of time, it'll be removed from the mempool because it's now invalid? Is that correct?


[02-Nov-18 04:52 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[02-Nov-18 04:53 AM] lukechilds#2707
got it


[02-Nov-18 04:53 AM] lukechilds#2707
just an idea


[02-Nov-18 04:54 AM] lukechilds#2707
but what would happen if you submitted a transaction with an nLocktime of 59 mins in the past, the network accepts it because it's valid, but the next block takes 2 mins to mine, so your transaction is technically invalid at the time the block is mined


[02-Nov-18 04:54 AM] lukechilds#2707
would the block be invalid?


[02-Nov-18 04:55 AM] lukechilds#2707
or would the network accept it?


[02-Nov-18 04:55 AM] lukechilds#2707
just trying to figure out how far back I can safely set nLocktime to maximise users rewards


[02-Nov-18 04:55 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a consensus rule


[02-Nov-18 04:55 AM] lukechilds#2707
but obvs don't wanna cause failed transactions/blocks


[02-Nov-18 04:55 AM] jl777c#5810
I set it back 777 seconds


[02-Nov-18 04:56 AM] jl777c#5810
the extra satoshis compared to the frustration of a tx being invalidated


[02-Nov-18 04:56 AM] lukechilds#2707
true, was also just kinda interested in that scenario as a thought experiment


[02-Nov-18 04:57 AM] lukechilds#2707
so when you say it's a consensus rule, you mean that the nodes would validate all the TXs in the block, treat that TX as invalid and discard the entire block as invalid? Is that correct?


[02-Nov-18 04:58 AM] jl777c#5810
any block with that tx mined in it will get rejected


[02-Nov-18 04:58 AM] jl777c#5810
a sad miner will be


[02-Nov-18 04:59 AM] lukechilds#2707
ok, wasn't sure if maybe the timestamp in the block header would be used to check the date instead of the time receiving the block. As you could then verify that the miner was following the rules


[02-Nov-18 04:59 AM] jl777c#5810
i think it is using the block timestamp so it can know during block construction it is invalid


[02-Nov-18 04:59 AM] jl777c#5810
in any case, nothing good comes from pushing too close to the edge


[02-Nov-18 05:00 AM] jl777c#5810
we used to get 30 min+ between blocks


[02-Nov-18 05:00 AM] jl777c#5810
now that doesnt seem to be the case anymore, but still always possible to get a long time between blocks


[02-Nov-18 05:00 AM] lukechilds#2707
but a lot of good comes from finding exactly where the edge is so you can be sure you don't go past it üòâ


[02-Nov-18 05:01 AM] jl777c#5810
I only go 777 seconds back out of 3600


[02-Nov-18 05:02 AM] lukechilds#2707
and teh reason for going back 777 instead of 0 is to account for node clock variation so out of (time) sync nodes don't discard yout TX, correct?


[02-Nov-18 05:05 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[02-Nov-18 05:05 AM] jl777c#5810
also the actual check is not current time but the median blocktime of the past 17 block window


[02-Nov-18 05:05 AM] jl777c#5810
or about 9 minutes in the past


[02-Nov-18 05:06 AM] lukechilds#2707
oh interesting


[02-Nov-18 05:06 AM] lukechilds#2707
so if you set nLocktime as -59 mins then you could end up trying to claim a reward before it existed


[02-Nov-18 05:06 AM] jl777c#5810
little know quirk that makes some CLTV claims fail by not being in the past enough


[02-Nov-18 05:07 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe there is an extra 8 minutes in there that you can squeeze out


[02-Nov-18 05:07 AM] lukechilds#2707
also


[02-Nov-18 05:07 AM] lukechilds#2707
one other idea


[02-Nov-18 05:08 AM] jl777c#5810
I just like to have it so the tx confirms and a setback of 777 achieves this in virtually all cases


[02-Nov-18 05:08 AM] lukechilds#2707
yep I understand


[02-Nov-18 05:08 AM] lukechilds#2707
what is the time drift allowed between different miner clocks?


[02-Nov-18 05:08 AM] lukechilds#2707
not sure what the correct terminology is


[02-Nov-18 05:08 AM] jl777c#5810
60 seconds forward


[02-Nov-18 05:09 AM] jl777c#5810
10 minutes behind (I think)


[02-Nov-18 05:09 AM] jl777c#5810
yes a dominant miner can likely gain an extra 10 minutes of rewards


[02-Nov-18 05:09 AM] lukechilds#2707
yep


[02-Nov-18 05:10 AM] lukechilds#2707
but yeah, I guess that's not a huge issues


[02-Nov-18 05:10 AM] lukechilds#2707
if it's only 1 min forward


[02-Nov-18 05:10 AM] jl777c#5810
much bigger issues at play if there is such a dominant miner than fractional gains from rewards


[02-Nov-18 05:11 AM] lukechilds#2707
wait, where does the extra 10 mins come from?


[02-Nov-18 05:11 AM] jl777c#5810
blocktimestamps are arbitrary


[02-Nov-18 05:11 AM] lukechilds#2707
I was gonna say they get extra fees becuase their clock is 1 min ahead of the clients clock that calcualted their interest


[02-Nov-18 05:11 AM] lukechilds#2707
and other miners will accept that due to the 1 min drift allowance


[02-Nov-18 05:11 AM] jl777c#5810
but it is the best time reference the blockchain has


[02-Nov-18 05:12 AM] lukechilds#2707
but how do you go from 1 min extra to 10 mins extra?


[02-Nov-18 05:12 AM] jl777c#5810
there needs to be more negative timestamps allowed than forward timestamps


[02-Nov-18 05:12 AM] jl777c#5810
to avoid timewarp attacks


[02-Nov-18 05:13 AM] jl777c#5810
so you can have a block a minute from the future or 10 minutes in the past


[02-Nov-18 05:13 AM] lukechilds#2707
but the negative timestamps won't affect interest will they? because the interest calcs are done via a users clock, not the blockhcain timestamps


[02-Nov-18 05:14 AM] lukechilds#2707
*the interest calcs signed in the TX


[02-Nov-18 05:14 AM] jl777c#5810
unless there is a timewarp attack going on, it wont affect things


[02-Nov-18 05:14 AM] jl777c#5810
even with a timewarp attack going on, by back dating it 777 seconds, i think most cases are fine


[02-Nov-18 05:15 AM] jl777c#5810
calculate based on local clock, consensus based on previous blocktime and nLockTime


[02-Nov-18 05:15 AM] jl777c#5810
there really are a lot of different things going on and getting a stable working consensus wasnt easy


[02-Nov-18 05:15 AM] jl777c#5810
now that it works, I dont want to fix it


[02-Nov-18 05:15 AM] lukechilds#2707
yeah, I will definitely use 777 in our app


[02-Nov-18 05:16 AM] lukechilds#2707
just wanted to understand how it worked

Hey @jl777c, I‚Äôve implemented the interest calculations in JavaScript.

I used the komodod C implementation for reference, however it seems like there‚Äôs a lot of stuff going on in there and I found it a little hard to follow. Also looks like theres some consensus enforcing logic that‚Äôs important to be enforced in Komodo but really not strictly necessary to be enforced in a client library just used for calculating the values. ‚Ä®‚Ä®I also used the Agama JavaScript and dexstats.info PHP implementations as secondary reference, however I‚Äôve found quite a few contradictions between their implementations and the Komodo implementation so I think there are some bugs in both of those. I‚Äôve followed the C implementation much more closely than the others (I think).

If you don‚Äôt mind taking a look at my code and letting me know If I‚Äôve correctly interpreted your code I can help fix the Agama and dexstats.info implementation.

I‚Äôm not sure how familiar you are with JavaScript but I‚Äôve tried to write the code as clear and readable as possible with comments so hopefully it should be pretty straight forward for you to understand and soo if anything is missing.


[27-Nov-18 09:57 PM] lukechilds#2707
To talk you through what I‚Äôm doing in plain English:

Function accepts locktime, height and satoshis of a UTXO and returns the accrued interest.

- First we need to calculate the coinage.
- - Subtract the locktime from the unixtime to get the coinage.
- - Divide this value by 60 to give the coinage in minutes.
- - Round the coinage down to ensure we have a whole number of minutes.
- Now some checks to see if the UTXO is eligible for interest
- - Return 0 if height >= KOMODO_ENDOFERA
- - Return 0 if locktime < LOCKTIME_THRESHOLD
- - Return 0 if satoshis < 10 KMD
- - Return 0 if coinage < ONE_HOUR
- Now we need to cap the reward period if the coinage is over a certain amount
- - If tx height is < 1000000 cap reward period at one year
- - If tx height is >= 1000000 cap reward period at one month
- Subtract 59 minutes from reward period
- Calculate the final reward amount by:
- - satoshis / 10512000
- - Round the result down to ensure we have an integer
- - multiply this integer by the reward period
-  As a final sanity check, this should never happen, but if the reward amount is a negative number, just return 0.
- Return the reward amount.

Btw, what is this 10512000 value? Some kind of interest multiplier? How would you describe this number? Need a clear variable name for it haha.

I also have a number of questions based on the C code, regarding things that I‚Äôm not quite sure what they‚Äôre doing and whether I should be including them in my calculations or if they‚Äôre not relevant to this use case. But I‚Äôll let you get back to me on what you think of this before I spam you with a load of questions about that.


[27-Nov-18 09:58 PM] lukechilds#2707
Thanks!


[28-Nov-18 12:07 AM] jl777c#5810
above sounds correct. of course there is no need to check about height 1 million or not as we are well past it, just cap to a month I think I used 31 days


[28-Nov-18 12:08 AM] jl777c#5810
the 10512000 I call divisor. it is just what the math works out when you do 5% based on minutes


[28-Nov-18 12:08 AM] jl777c#5810
pbca26 has the same logic in javascript for agama over SPV

@pbca26


[28-Nov-18 12:15 AM] lukechilds#2707
I still need to check the height for old UTXOs though right


[28-Nov-18 12:15 AM] lukechilds#2707
if a UTXO was created before block 1 million then it can accrue interest for a year cant it?


[28-Nov-18 12:16 AM] lukechilds#2707
I'm pretty sure that's how the source code in Komodo handles it


[28-Nov-18 12:16 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, that is true! sorry, need more coffee

There are a few errors in it


[28-Nov-18 12:20 AM] lukechilds#2707
but only minor ones


[28-Nov-18 12:20 AM] lukechilds#2707
should likely not cause it to fail, just will result in less interest being claimed than is available


[28-Nov-18 12:21 AM] lukechilds#2707
and in some cases might result in weird output but I that would only normally occur if people were feeding in dodgy input, not with legitimate transactions


[28-Nov-18 12:22 AM] lukechilds#2707
@jl777c I'm also a little confused about when I should and shouldn't be rounding down


[28-Nov-18 12:22 AM] lukechilds#2707
I think I got it right


[28-Nov-18 12:26 AM] lukechilds#2707
For example I do `coinage = Math.floor((unixtime - locktime) / ONE_HOUR)` so coinage is always an integer. However in Agama it does `timestampDiffMinutes = timestampDiff / 60`. Notice this isn't rounded, so the minutes can be a floating value. All calcualtions are done based on this floating value and then the final value is rounded down.

I think my version is correct in that all calculations should be done with integers with no need to round the final result.
As opposed to Agama where calculations are done to floatin point precision and the rounded down at the end


[28-Nov-18 12:26 AM] lukechilds#2707
Am I correct?


[28-Nov-18 12:26 AM] lukechilds#2707
or should I implement it like it is in the Agama implementation


[28-Nov-18 12:27 AM] jl777c#5810
komodod doesnt use floating point


[28-Nov-18 12:27 AM] jl777c#5810
so all calcs are rounded, even the intermediate


[28-Nov-18 12:27 AM] jl777c#5810
i have zero idea how javascript does its expression handling


[28-Nov-18 12:27 AM] jl777c#5810
the problem with agama was it was using floating point and multiplying a fraction that wasnt there in the integer calcs


[28-Nov-18 12:28 AM] lukechilds#2707
right, but the results I get from my function and the Agama function are different


[28-Nov-18 12:28 AM] lukechilds#2707
only slightly


[28-Nov-18 12:28 AM] lukechilds#2707
and both are accepted by the network


[28-Nov-18 12:28 AM] lukechilds#2707
but I'm only testing with small values


[28-Nov-18 12:28 AM] lukechilds#2707
I think with larger values, the Agama implementation would drift further away, maybe even to the point that it becomes invalid


[28-Nov-18 12:30 AM] lukechilds#2707
I also have a few questions from your source


[28-Nov-18 12:31 AM] lukechilds#2707
just to see if I need to implement any of these missing bits in my implementation


[28-Nov-18 12:31 AM] lukechilds#2707
2 secs, will find my lsit


[28-Nov-18 12:40 AM] lukechilds#2707
@jl777c I‚Äôve numbered the questions, would be great if you could reply with the numbers so I can easily work out which bits you‚Äôre replying to.

1)
What is the `(minutes= (tiptime - nLockTime) / 60) >= (KOMODO_MAXMEMPOOLTIME/60)` check for? Do I need to implement this.

2)
There a re a few checks for `tiptime != 0`. What are these for? Do I ned to implement them?

3)
what is `nValue > 25000LL*COIN` for? Checking max supply? Do I need to implement it?

4)
What is this block of code for? Looks like it‚Äôs maybe blacklisting previous supply inflation attacks or something?

```
if ( (txheight == 116607 && nValue == 2502721100000LL) ||
    (txheight == 126891 && nValue == 2879650000000LL) ||
    (txheight == 129510 && nValue == 3000000000000LL) ||
    (txheight == 141549 && nValue == 3500000000000LL) ||
    (txheight == 154473 && nValue == 3983399350000LL) ||
    (txheight == 154736 && nValue == 3983406748175LL) ||
    (txheight == 155013 && nValue == 3983414006565LL) ||
    (txheight == 155492 && nValue == 3983427592291LL) ||
    (txheight == 155613 && nValue == 9997409999999797LL) ||
    (txheight == 157927 && nValue == 9997410667451072LL) ||
    (txheight == 155613 && nValue == 2590000000000LL) ||
    (txheight == 155949 && nValue == 4000000000000LL) )
    exception = 1;

    printf(">>>>>>>>>>>> exception.%d txheight.%d %.8f locktime %u vs tiptime %u <<<<<<<<<\n",exception,txheight,(double)nValue/COIN,nLockTime,tiptime);
```


[28-Nov-18 12:40 AM] lukechilds#2707
5)
Do I need to do anything to handle pre interest activation?

There are references to less than block 250000 and `activation = 1491350400;  // 1491350400 5th April`.

Is this when interest was activated? Do I need to disable interest claims on UTXOs older than this?

Some examples of where it appears. I‚Äôm not quite sure what it‚Äôs doing but it doesn‚Äôt seem to be disabling anything.

```
numerator = (nValue / 20); // assumes 5%!
                    if ( txheight < 250000 )
                        interest = (numerator / denominator);
```

```
if ( txheight < 250000 || tiptime < activation )
                {
                    if ( txheight < 250000 || numerator * minutes < 365 * 24 * 60 )
                        interest = (numerator / denominator) / COIN;
                    else interest = ((numerator * minutes) / ((uint64_t)365 * 24 * 60)) / COIN;
                }
```


[28-Nov-18 12:50 AM] jl777c#5810
1 . that is the one hour check.
2. just a sanity check that there is a non-zero tiptime. a 0 tiptime would create negative duration
3. ignore
4. ignore
5. no


[28-Nov-18 01:51 AM] lukechilds#2707
thanks for you answers


[28-Nov-18 01:51 AM] lukechilds#2707
also, re the devisor


[28-Nov-18 01:51 AM] lukechilds#2707
I'm still not quite sure what exactly this is


[28-Nov-18 01:52 AM] lukechilds#2707
when you get a value and devide it by a deviser it gives you the interest per minute, right?


[28-Nov-18 01:52 AM] lukechilds#2707
so you can multiply that up for the duration of minutes to find the total interest amount


[28-Nov-18 01:52 AM] lukechilds#2707
how did you actually calculate the value 10512000?


[28-Nov-18 01:53 AM] lukechilds#2707
would just like to make the meaning a bit more clear in my code so I understand it when I come back to it


[28-Nov-18 02:05 AM] jl777c#5810
it does all the multiplying and dividing needed to end up at 5% APR


[28-Nov-18 02:05 AM] jl777c#5810
i just combined numerator and denominator constants into a single one, but this way it avoids any overflow/underflow issues


[28-Nov-18 02:06 AM] jl777c#5810
in essence it is a constant. if you use half its value, then it will be 10% APR


[28-Nov-18 02:06 AM] jl777c#5810
if you use double the value 2.5% APR


[28-Nov-18 02:06 AM] jl777c#5810
it is just the constant that calculates 5% APR when used in the equation where it is


[28-Nov-18 02:09 AM] jl777c#5810
365 * 24 * 60 / 10512000 = 0.05


[28-Nov-18 02:10 AM] jl777c#5810
it is the divisor to use on the minutes in a year to get 5%


[28-Nov-18 02:10 AM] lukechilds#2707
I see, thanks


[28-Nov-18 02:11 AM] lukechilds#2707
and `rewardPeriod -= 59;`


[28-Nov-18 02:11 AM] lukechilds#2707
that is to make sure the first hour of coinage doesn't account towards the accrued interest. Is that correct?


[28-Nov-18 02:11 AM] jl777c#5810
correct


[28-Nov-18 02:12 AM] lukechilds#2707
out of interest, why is it 59 instead of 60?


[28-Nov-18 02:13 AM] jl777c#5810
to avoid divide by zero?


[28-Nov-18 02:14 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess it wouldnt have divided by zero. it was done in the midst of a week without any sleep as we were bombarded with three different attacks


[28-Nov-18 02:14 AM] jl777c#5810
so just instinct to use 59 instead of 60


[28-Nov-18 02:15 AM] lukechilds#2707
ah, I see


[28-Nov-18 02:15 AM] jl777c#5810
and once it was done, it would take a hard fork to "fix" it


[28-Nov-18 02:15 AM] jl777c#5810
there is nothing wrong with the number 59 though, it is just as valid a number as 60. so the 59 numbers lobby fought hard to keep it there


[28-Nov-18 02:16 AM] lukechilds#2707
lol


[28-Nov-18 02:16 AM] lukechilds#2707
this might be a bit of a pain


[28-Nov-18 02:18 AM] lukechilds#2707
but by any chance would you be able to pull out the interest calc code and give me a binary I can pass values to and get the reward output.

I would like to vigorously check my implementation is compliant with the network consensus and write a test suite to ensure it stays compliant


[28-Nov-18 02:18 AM] lukechilds#2707
it would be good to publish my function as an independent module so all other software in the Komodo ecosystem can pull in this module and benefit from it


[28-Nov-18 02:18 AM] lukechilds#2707
rather than having everyoen implement it themselves with their own various quirks


[28-Nov-18 02:19 AM] lukechilds#2707
I'm thinking something like:

```
$ calcinterest locktime height satoshis
0.00257346
```


[28-Nov-18 02:19 AM] lukechilds#2707
as a binary executed on the CLI


[28-Nov-18 02:20 AM] lukechilds#2707
obvs `locktime`, `height`, and `satoshis` would be replaced with numbers


[28-Nov-18 02:20 AM] lukechilds#2707
bonus points for allowing the current time to be passed in too


[28-Nov-18 02:20 AM] lukechilds#2707
instead of using the system clock


[28-Nov-18 02:20 AM] jl777c#5810
gettxout has "interest" field


[28-Nov-18 02:21 AM] lukechilds#2707
is that an RPC command?


[28-Nov-18 02:21 AM] lukechilds#2707
and I pass it a TXID?


[28-Nov-18 02:23 AM] jl777c#5810
gettxout txid vout


[28-Nov-18 02:23 AM] jl777c#5810
yes pass in txid and vout of a utxo


[28-Nov-18 02:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
yep


[28-Nov-18 02:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
got that working


[28-Nov-18 02:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
only issue is it uses the system time


[28-Nov-18 02:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
rather than me being able to pass a time in


[28-Nov-18 02:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
so hard to validate against accurately


[28-Nov-18 02:25 AM] lukechilds#2707
oh no sorry


[28-Nov-18 02:25 AM] lukechilds#2707
looks like it uses the time from the latest block


[28-Nov-18 02:25 AM] jl777c#5810
it should use chaintip nTime


[28-Nov-18 02:25 AM] jl777c#5810
not system time


[28-Nov-18 02:25 AM] jl777c#5810
so not sure the issue


[28-Nov-18 02:25 AM] lukechilds#2707
ah great!


[28-Nov-18 02:25 AM] lukechilds#2707
I must of just checked it twice, the second time right after a new block


[28-Nov-18 02:26 AM] lukechilds#2707
so I can run that, check the current block time and the interest amount, and then use those values to test against my JS implementation by spoofing the time?


[28-Nov-18 02:28 AM] lukechilds#2707
so the network is validing interest on new transactions based on the time of the latest block, not the system time


[28-Nov-18 02:28 AM] lukechilds#2707
is that correct?


[28-Nov-18 02:29 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[28-Nov-18 02:29 AM] jl777c#5810
tiptime


[28-Nov-18 02:29 AM] jl777c#5810
nTime of chaintip


[28-Nov-18 02:29 AM] lukechilds#2707
which means if I create a TX with perfect interest accuracy using my system clock, it would likely be rejected by the network because they checking against the time of the latest block, which could be ~1 minute behind


[28-Nov-18 02:29 AM] jl777c#5810
use tiptime


[28-Nov-18 02:30 AM] jl777c#5810
odds are unless it is a very large amount, it wont matter (it would reduce the actual txfee a bit)


[28-Nov-18 02:30 AM] lukechilds#2707
ah ok, it's just a web app connecting to Insight


[28-Nov-18 02:30 AM] lukechilds#2707
should be able to get the latest block and use the time from that


[28-Nov-18 02:36 AM] lukechilds#2707
Thanks, you've been very helpful üôå


[28-Nov-18 03:17 AM] lukechilds#2707
@jl777c WOOOOOO, I tested some UTXOs against `komodo-cli gettxout <TXID> <index>` and then used the same time of the latest block with my JS implementation and the results are 100% identical üéâ


[28-Nov-18 03:17 AM] lukechilds#2707
I can write a suite of unit tests around that too


[28-Nov-18 03:18 AM] lukechilds#2707
and publish this as a reusable module


[28-Nov-18 03:18 AM] lukechilds#2707
so we'll get notified if any changes are made that breaks Komodo consensus


[28-Nov-18 03:22 AM] jl777c#5810
sounds great!


[28-Nov-18 03:27 AM] CHMEX#0686
@lukechilds  but komodo-cli gettxout only works for your wallets right?


[28-Nov-18 03:28 AM] lukechilds#2707
It worked for me on a UTXO I don't own but possibly because I had txindex on


[28-Nov-18 03:28 AM] lukechilds#2707
either way, it doesn't matter


[28-Nov-18 03:28 AM] lukechilds#2707
this only needs ot be done for me to create a reproducible test suite


[28-Nov-18 03:28 AM] lukechilds#2707
to garantee our reward calculations comply with Komdo consensus


[28-Nov-18 03:28 AM] lukechilds#2707
end users will never need to run it


[28-Nov-18 03:28 AM] jl777c#5810
gettxout works at the blockchain level, not wallet


[28-Nov-18 03:30 AM] lukechilds#2707
@jl777c I just had an awsome idea


[28-Nov-18 03:30 AM] lukechilds#2707
is it desirable that nLockTime is required to be set on a UTXO for rewards to be claimed?


[28-Nov-18 03:30 AM] lukechilds#2707
or is that just a side affect?


[28-Nov-18 03:30 AM] jl777c#5810
it makes it go faster


[28-Nov-18 03:30 AM] jl777c#5810
it is slow enough as it is


[28-Nov-18 03:31 AM] jl777c#5810
would be a hardfork to change it


[28-Nov-18 03:31 AM] lukechilds#2707
I've thought of a way you could remove the nLockTime requirement without a hardfork


[28-Nov-18 03:31 AM] lukechilds#2707
it would be a softfork upgrade


[28-Nov-18 03:31 AM] lukechilds#2707
but I hadn't considered performance


[28-Nov-18 03:31 AM] lukechilds#2707
that may be an issue


[28-Nov-18 03:38 AM] jl777c#5810
each utxo needed to lookup the block...


[28-Nov-18 03:39 AM] jl777c#5810
it is the same reason CLTV requires the nLockTime in the tx itself


[28-Nov-18 03:51 AM] lukechilds#2707
Requiring nLockTime to be set is a pain because many wallets don‚Äôt support setting it. So even if you send your funds to a wallet using nLockTime, any transactions you make which return change will not have nLockTime set meaning you lose the ability to claim rewards on all your change UTXOs. This could reasonably be a large amount of your balance.

Being able to claim rewards without needing nLockTime set would resolve this and allow you to claim rewards on change UTXOs and other UTXOs created by non nLockTime supported wallets.

It also has the added benefit that all the transactions not using nLockTime from users who aren‚Äôt interested in claiming rewards (e.g exchanges) would automatically have rewards available. These users would likely not claim them meaning the rewards would then go to miners, increasing mining profitability.


[28-Nov-18 03:51 AM] lukechilds#2707
My proposal would be:

Instead of calculating the reward period as (latest block time - nLockTime), calculate the reward period as (latest block time - UTXO block time). This can be implement as a soft fork.

One downside would be that it‚Äôs common practise for people to set nLockTime slightly in the past (often 777 seconds). This would mean that people calculating rewards using the nLockTime way would be invalid because the reward period they‚Äôd calculate would be slightly longer (e.g 777 seconds longer than tip to tip accounting for the extra nLockTime) than the consensus rules and so would be rejected.

So its a soft fork, it won‚Äôt cause a chain split. But it would cause people using the old reward logic to get their reward claim transactions rejected. If they used the new logic, everything would work as expected.

However there is a way to also allow the old reward claiming logic to validate against the new rules. nLockTime is limited to one hour in the past. So instead of calculating the reward period as (latest block time - UTXO block time) we calculate it as (latest block time - UTXO block time - 1 hour). Adding this extra hour accounts for all possible nLockTime sizes so people claiming with the old nLockTime based logic would always be inside the allowed reward period.

As you mentioned, the only difference is performance.

With the current method, we need to lookup latest block time.
With the non nLockTime method you‚Äôd need to lookup latest block time and UTXO block time.

I think the benefits are pretty huge, but I have no idea how much that extra block lookup would hurt performance.

How much of a difference would that make? Would it be completely infeasible?


[28-Nov-18 03:58 AM] jl777c#5810
every single vin in every single tx would incur a block lookup, and vins can be from anytime in the past, ie. likely a random seek


[28-Nov-18 03:58 AM] jl777c#5810
also, setting nLockTime is not such a large burden for third party wallets, which by now all are doing


[28-Nov-18 03:59 AM] jl777c#5810
i am reluctant to mess with interest calc consensus rules as it was very tricky to get it stable and if it works, why fix it


[28-Nov-18 04:32 AM] lukechilds#2707
Well the benefits are the reasons I mentioned above


[28-Nov-18 04:32 AM] lukechilds#2707
but yeah


[28-Nov-18 04:33 AM] lukechilds#2707
what you say makes sense


[28-Nov-18 04:33 AM] lukechilds#2707
a random lookup through the entire blockchain for every single input in a block is probably not a good idea


[28-Nov-18 04:35 AM] lukechilds#2707
one other solution would be to count the reward period as number of blocks


[28-Nov-18 04:35 AM] lukechilds#2707
e.g tip height - UTXO height


[28-Nov-18 04:35 AM] lukechilds#2707
but I guess that's still a lookup


[28-Nov-18 04:36 AM] lukechilds#2707
but that seems like it could be indexed very efficiently


[28-Nov-18 04:36 AM] lukechilds#2707
but then that requires treating 1 block as 1 minute


[28-Nov-18 04:36 AM] lukechilds#2707
which in theor is ok


[28-Nov-18 04:36 AM] lukechilds#2707
but in practise could open up some nasty attacks


[28-Nov-18 04:37 AM] jl777c#5810
exactly and this is an area where we were attacked for real


[28-Nov-18 04:37 AM] lukechilds#2707
like messing with difficulty and giving a large incentive to rapidly mine blocks to not only get block rewards but also massive amounts of rewards


[28-Nov-18 04:38 AM] lukechilds#2707
do you have any idea how much of a perf impact looking up the TX time for each vin would have?


[28-Nov-18 04:38 AM] lukechilds#2707
I agree now that you said that it's probably not a good idea


[28-Nov-18 04:38 AM] lukechilds#2707
but I am intrigued to know how much it would affect performance


[28-Nov-18 04:38 AM] lukechilds#2707
and if it would have a negative affect on the network


[28-Nov-18 04:39 AM] lukechilds#2707
or just slightly increase daemon resources


[28-Nov-18 04:42 AM] jl777c#5810
i think it would slow down sync from scratch by 2x


[28-Nov-18 04:45 AM] lukechilds#2707
Ok yeah, thats not really worth the trade off


[28-Nov-18 04:46 AM] lukechilds#2707
I thought I'd had an amazing idea then haha üòÖ


[28-Nov-18 04:54 AM] jl777c#5810
the tricky part is that the tx needs the block it was in to be validated and sometimes the same tx is in more than one block. most of the bitcoin code assumes a tx can be validated in isolation


[28-Nov-18 04:55 AM] jl777c#5810
i am sure that it is possible to do... but it isnt without ongoing cost and if the only downside is wallets that cant do nLockTime, then better to fix them


[28-Nov-18 07:10 AM] lukechilds#2707
ahh I get you


[28-Nov-18 07:11 AM] lukechilds#2707
because a BTC transaction has all the data needed to validate it within itself and the UTXO set


[28-Nov-18 07:12 AM] lukechilds#2707
Once you start requiring external bits of data, the BTC derived code doesn't account for that so you need to start patching things to make it work


[28-Nov-18 07:12 AM] lukechilds#2707
and the more external data you require, the more things you have to patch


[28-Nov-18 07:14 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[28-Nov-18 07:15 AM] jl777c#5810
possible but has risk


[28-Nov-18 03:29 PM] lukechilds#2707
by the way, how do you think is the best way to group the UTXOs to claim interest from a Ledger Live acount?


[28-Nov-18 03:29 PM] lukechilds#2707
They use BIP44


[28-Nov-18 03:29 PM] lukechilds#2707
not sure how familiar you are with it


[28-Nov-18 03:30 PM] lukechilds#2707
but it has the concept of accounts


[28-Nov-18 03:30 PM] lukechilds#2707
and inside an account you have a new address derived for each recieving TX and a new address derived for each change TX


[28-Nov-18 03:30 PM] lukechilds#2707
if you make a payment larger than a single UTXO for one of your addresses it will combine UTXOs together from any addresses in that account


[28-Nov-18 03:31 PM] lukechilds#2707
but it will never combine UTXOs from seperate accounts to preserve anonymity between accounts


[28-Nov-18 03:31 PM] lukechilds#2707
the way that makes the most sense to me would be to allow users to claim rewards per account


[28-Nov-18 03:32 PM] lukechilds#2707
claiming on an account wil combine all UTXOs from all addresses in that account (received and change) into a single transaction and send to a new unused address from that account with interest


[28-Nov-18 03:32 PM] lukechilds#2707
this will consolidate all UTXOs/addresses in the account to a single UTXO


[28-Nov-18 03:35 PM] lukechilds#2707
the pros are:
- It's only a single TX that has to be manually approved by the user on the Ledger
- We can sweep all UTXOs, including one's that don't have nLockTime set (like change UTXOs in Ledger), meaning they will now start acruing interest in the new UTXO
So the end result is you have your entire balance in a single new unused address all now acruing interest (even the UTXOs that weren't acruing interest before)


[28-Nov-18 03:35 PM] lukechilds#2707
the cons are:
- This is bad for privacy, it clearly links all your addresses within that account together in a single TX
However only for that account, other accounts would have their own TX


[28-Nov-18 03:38 PM] lukechilds#2707
It seems like maybe the privacy issue isn't a huge issue in the Komodo community as public addresses aren't *that* private anyway, and can already be linked with chain analysis. This would just make it easier. If Komodo users want privacy they use Z addresses.

It also seems like it's quite common in the Komodo community (encouraged by Agama, BarterDEX) to just have a single address that is re-used for incoming/change transactions and then use a Z address for privacy. Reusing a single address for everything has even less rpivacy than using seperate BIP44 addresses and occasionally consolidating them.


[28-Nov-18 03:38 PM] lukechilds#2707
That's just my assumption, so correct me if I'm wrong. But it seems like if that is the case, then combining UTXOs from different addresses in the same BIP44 account shouldn't be a big deal.


[28-Nov-18 03:40 PM] lukechilds#2707
I've already spoken to Komodo Ledger users who have said they use multiple BIP44 accounts in Ledger to seperate their funds properly. This is issue won't affect them. They will have a seperate reward claim transaction for each BIP44 account consolidating only the UTXOs *inside* those account.


[28-Nov-18 03:41 PM] lukechilds#2707
If this is an issue, the alternative would be to create a seperate reward clam transaction per address. So every address in every account get's it's own claim TX.
the pros are:
- preserves anonymity slighly, all account UTXOs aren't consolidated into a single transaction, it was one TX for 1 address
the cons are:
- requires a seperate TX per address. This is quite a huge pain for the user. Each TX need to be signed on the Ledger device, which is slow, and manually approved by clicking buttons on the Ledger. If they have been using the account for a long time it could have hundreds of UTXOs. This would involve manually verifying and physically clicking the button on the device hundreds of times.
- it isn't actually that much more private than my previous proposal. All addresses in the accounts will probably be claimed very close together and would quite likely make it into the same block. So although they aren't linked in the same TX, it would be quite obvious if you see a block with a large amount of reward claims going from one address to another in the same block that they are all from the same person.


[28-Nov-18 03:47 PM] lukechilds#2707
I'm leaning towards the first implementation, one TX for all account UTXOs. It's not as private as the second option but clear addresses aren't private anyway. Someone can already follow your chain of TXs with chain analysis if they want to, this just makes it a bit more obvious. If users want real privacy, they should use a Z address.


[28-Nov-18 03:58 PM] lukechilds#2707
@jl777c what do you think?


[28-Nov-18 11:24 PM] jl777c#5810
I agree with you. a simpler implementation will be more reliable and anybody that believes they have privacy without zaddr is just kidding themselves


[28-Nov-18 11:25 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as the funds separation is retained for the different accounts, that seems to be a non-privacy related issue, whatever solution seems fine

I hope that everyone in this channel remembers it was due to the work of Luke that made claiming rewards from ledger possible. The fact that @PTYX decided to steal our idea and steal the credit without contributing a cent to the development is low.

the term ```interest``` was used and not ```rewards```. other than that... was it stolen?  I think @PTYX  has contributed to this ecosystem.  How much should it be to integrate the ledger claim feature? I'm sure this could be of value to future white label package clients.


[10-Dec-18 01:58 AM] hyperDEX#6586
The team uses rewards @actionslacks . @PTYX has contributed to the ecosystem i have no doubt, but who has funded the dev hours to get ledger claim support when ledger themselves did not want to do it? Who has contributed to the dev hours to test and come up with this solution?

The answers to the questions above just to be clear was me. I paid for the dev hours to come up with a solution and to get ledger to merge in the code (Without this code merged there is no way for PTYX to do a rewards claim). I did it for the community and to hopefully collect a small fee so we can continue to fund more development for Komodo.

[10-Dec-18 05:22 AM] PTYX#6840
@hyperDEX i stole your idea. how awful of me to use open source software.


[10-Dec-18 05:25 AM] PTYX#6840
if you wanted fame, money, or recognition, then you should have closed sourced it. I am not going to twiddle my thumbs and wait months to have a working claim function on a wallet. I also wasn't going to wait months to see the ChainZilla token on the ledger device. I think your behavior is childish, I do hope all those words sink in later when you read them again.

[10-Dec-18 05:34 AM] PTYX#6840
so let me get this right. @hyperDEX funded the ledger implementation. didn't get a contract, didn't get paid, and released it to the open source wild before securing funding


[10-Dec-18 05:34 AM] PTYX#6840
how exactly does that work?


[10-Dec-18 05:34 AM] PTYX#6840
same for hyperdex


[10-Dec-18 05:34 AM] PTYX#6840
so........


[10-Dec-18 05:34 AM] PTYX#6840
how is that my fault


[10-Dec-18 05:35 AM] PTYX#6840
ok


[10-Dec-18 05:35 AM] PTYX#6840
it's simple. you get it to work 99% of the time, then you sell it


[10-Dec-18 05:35 AM] PTYX#6840
it's not rocket science.


[10-Dec-18 05:36 AM] PTYX#6840
you monetize every part of it. the trades, ads, and implementations. So there is revenue flowing however small.


[10-Dec-18 05:37 AM] PTYX#6840
but it needs to work first


[10-Dec-18 05:37 AM] PTYX#6840
noone wants to buy a DEX that dies every 15 minutes or drops connection for x, y, or z reason

i had a client that wanted a whitelabel HyperDEX


[10-Dec-18 05:39 AM] PTYX#6840
some weeks back. I brought them to @hyperDEX and didn't get a response for 2 weeks. The client is gone now, looking for something more reliable. However, i bring this point up to show the lack of business interest on hpyerdex's part


[10-Dec-18 05:39 AM] PTYX#6840
that could have been a source of revenue

That's the other issue


[10-Dec-18 08:29 AM] lukechilds#2707
So there's the fact that this wallet  clearly makes use of our work on the Ledger firmware. But we've done that for the community, anyone is free to use that how they wish. It's kind of uncool to announce you've done it first right before we've made it clear we're about to publically announce our app, but whatever.

[10-Dec-18 08:32 AM] lukechilds#2707
```
For all software libraries, copyright law applies, and you must read and follow the license in order to use it legally. For a MIT licensed code library, if you distribute the resulting package, you must also distribute it with a copy of the license including the original copyright notices. Failure to do so is "stealing" or more technically a copyright violation, which you should address.
```


[10-Dec-18 08:34 AM] lukechilds#2707
I hate the idea of copyright and I'm definitely not going to sue anyone over a dispute. But sometime it does genuinely serve to protect the right of software developers, and I kind of just trust other developers to respect that.

[10-Dec-18 08:46 AM] lukechilds#2707
If anyone is interested in viewing the actual license infringement, don't take my word for it, you can verify it for yourself.

Here is the link of the current minified JavaScript bundle being served by magnum wallet: https://app.magnumwallet.co/dist/build.js?v=99

You can search for the string "getKomodoRewards" which should bring you to this section of code:

```
{key:"getKomodoRewards",value:function(t,e,r,n){var i=Math.floor((t-e)/60);if(r>=7777777||e<5e8||n<1e9||i<60)return 0;var o=r>=1e6?44640:525600,a=Math.min(i,o);a-=59;var s=Math.floor(n/10512e3)*a;return Math.max(0,s)}}
```

This is a line for line direct copy of our getKomodoRewards() function here: https://github.com/atomiclabs/komodo-ledger-reward-claim/blob/master/src/lib/get-komodo-rewards.js

It looks different because it's been run through a build system and transpiled, minified and bundled. However if you view the logic line by line and compare it with our file you'll see it's functionally identical. 

if you run our function through a build system it'll come out looking the same.

I've added newlines at the end of each statement in the Magnum copy below if you want to compare it to our version more easily.

```
{
    key: "getKomodoRewards",
    value: function(t, e, r, n) {
        var i = Math.floor((t - e) / 60);
        if (r >= 7777777 || e < 5e8 || n < 1e9 || i < 60) return 0;
        var o = r >= 1e6 ? 44640 : 525600,
            a = Math.min(i, o);
        a -= 59;
        var s = Math.floor(n / 10512e3) * a;
        return Math.max(0, s)
    }
}
```

[10-Dec-18 01:34 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I have paid for the development in the hope to get some revenue to keep adding features to hyperDEX which is again a funding hole. So unless you want to help contribute to this funding, words are cheap.

The internet says ```LGPL does not prevent commercial use in any way, see e.g.¬†answers.google.com/answers/threadview/id/439136.html¬†Only a few open-source licenses limit by use case, and none of them are considered "free" by organisations like FSF. If you want to use a free license, the kind of split you want to achieve is usually done by having a strong free copyleft license, which does not prevent commercial use, but is off-putting to commercial users. Then your alternative could be worth purchasing for them, to avoid need to open-source their own code```

doesnt the GPL lincense force you to open source if you don't pay for it, but if you did pay for the code you can close source it.

Right but many companies look at their apps, workflows, and systems as IP

jeeeezus.   what's important is not being a dick.  but if ppl are going to be dicks, i can betya i can be one of the top 5 biggest dicks in this discord.   but being a dick doesn't work.

here's why:
1.  I create some code like a front end to marketmaker.
2. i put an MIT derived license on it, calling it the _dont-be-a-dick_ license.
3. in the license, i put names of the dicks that cannot use this software in any capacity, open source, proprietary, network program, software as a service.
4. some equally dickish group picks up on the dont-be-a-dick license, does a little digging then finds out where these dicks work or their businesses.

you can't work with open source and be a dick. the code is more powerful than the dick.  the only dicks allowed are sociopath ceos of multinationals.  but these dicks do evil things, much more evil that what has happened in this channel.

Please sort it out and audit your licenses and abide by them if acting in a commercial capacity.  copyright  (& more importantly the infringements) can be bought by bigger fish in the litigation game and it all shits on the work of the ecosystem.

I don't know about licenses etc, but after reading chat what I get is:
- MIT allows using the software/code with mention of it's source and authors with credit.
- Magnum intends to add the credit where it used the code from.
- Magnum is not open source?
- Better open source the code and then add the rewards library maybe?
- Until then maybe just hold on to that feature inaccessible until open sourced?

Just random thoughts just in case if there is really a respect for each others between @PTYX @hyperDEX and @lukechilds 

**Even if it sounds total unfair, it could possibly be done just for the good sake of friendship since you guys have been longer here enough working with each other.**


[10-Dec-18 11:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
And open source or not or whatever license it is started with, I'd suggest @lukechilds to immediately make it's code repo private. If you really don't want others to use this code right now until yours own is done.

@grewalsatinder Their wallet is closed source. They ripped whole sections of our code, which from what i understand with MIT they cannot do without including our file itself.


[11-Dec-18 01:04 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I dont think it is a option to have it closed source when it affects peoples funds. That is why we did not do it in such a manner. We just did not think that anyone outside of the Komodo ecosystem would care about it and ones that do care within Komodo would have enough respect for others to actually wait for a official release from the team that came up with the solution.

@hyperDEX  right, I understand this part.
I guess the option I said should be possible.
It might sound unfair, but for keeping the goodwill to me it makes sense.
@hyperDEX  I still suggest you to make that repo private if you don't want anyone to use that code before you release and object.


[11-Dec-18 01:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
At least I put a relationship on top of monetary value.
And like since I know you and worked with you since almost the begening of the project, I would have most probably sactificed by taking this release action back, just to keep the relation healthy, despite being the chances keeping the feature available and public and gaining anything through it.


[11-Dec-18 01:25 AM] hyperDEX#6586
There should be a level of respect in this space. Self promotion and self interest is not greater than community interests.


[11-Dec-18 01:26 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
mistakes can happen. From both ends. How it is sorted is yet to see.


[11-Dec-18 01:26 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I would have been open with them using the code, if they had contacted us and was willing to wait till our release was out.


[11-Dec-18 01:26 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I see it's your team's mistake to keep it public while it shouldn't have been when you are till experimenting and deving.


[11-Dec-18 01:27 AM] hyperDEX#6586
The solution here is that i will finish this app for the community, then some other person can sink their funds into funding devs.


[11-Dec-18 01:27 AM] hyperDEX#6586
No there is no mistake here @grewalsatinder  from our end about keeping repo public. The only mistake is thinking community members would think about Komodo as a whole before their own self interest.


[11-Dec-18 01:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
üôÇ If you don't consider it a mistake mate, then don't mind on the code being used by others.

[11-Dec-18 01:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
The intentions of yours is good mate, I know. 
but keeping the repo private wouldn't have done any kind of harm


[11-Dec-18 01:30 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Well not following the license is ok? Ripping our code instead of including our file is ok?


[11-Dec-18 01:30 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
this whole situation would have been totally avoided.


[11-Dec-18 01:31 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
you can expect to have trust in the team, but you can never have a trust on external parties. Just for the sake of any kind of infringements I think it makes sense to take the repo private until it is solved and the project release.


[11-Dec-18 01:31 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I don't see anything wrong with that.

I will leave the repo public, we have nothing to hide.

[11-Dec-18 01:37 AM] hyperDEX#6586
The only people interested in our code is people from the Komodo community. If someone wanted to use it they could have contacted us about it so they can wait till we have launched.


[11-Dec-18 01:37 AM] hyperDEX#6586
We would have been fine with that.


[11-Dec-18 01:39 AM] hyperDEX#6586

Regarding why the repo wasn‚Äôt private, the code was open source and linked to in this channel for review:

https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/502811530002300939/517217595800289382

The development of this whole project has been in the open. If you scroll up in this channel it‚Äôs pretty much a development log of the project since it began.

We can‚Äôt get peer review from the community on a closed source project.

And just because something is open source doesn‚Äôt mean others can take it and use it without attribution.

I dont care for marketing right now. We need mm 2.0 for HyperDEX to be viable. My stop gap was this ledger app. We will still get this out as our app imports all the addresses whereas magnum doesnt, and who would trust their funds to a closed source project anyway.

[11-Dec-18 08:08 AM] Magnum Wallet#0608
Hey, Magnum Wallet is here.
Let us clarify the yesterday issue from @hyperDEX and @lukechilds. 

Magnum is the active contributor for different coins, we are developing the universal wallet. Recently we decided to support Komodo, as one of the most valuable blockchains. Moreover, it has the perfect match with our marketing idea - multiply your funds. The user can multiply own funds using Komodo PoI build-in function. We have listed BTC, ETH, ETC, XTZ, BTG, BCH, Zilla and other coins in our wallet. It‚Äôs a blockchain infrastructure solution.

The claim of @hyperDEX and @lukechilds is about using the code that was written by @lukechilds chids. Magnum is closed source and because of this nobody is able to see the credentials in our source code. That is true, we are going to become open source next year, but not yet. 
But anyway, what we used from @lukechilds, it‚Äôs a getKomodoReward method that implements Komodo blockchain algorithm for claim value. I want to emphasise that its blockchain method, but not the know-how of the third party. It saved us about 1 hour. It‚Äôs not a rocket science to implement a known function that is described in the documentation I can say.


[11-Dec-18 08:08 AM] Magnum Wallet#0608
At the moment of Magnum release, @lukechilds child doesn‚Äôt have the working application to claim the rewards using Ledger. At least it doesn‚Äôt have transactions. 

We released the working app and make the delivery that solves Komodo needs. Now I see that getKomodoReward is a big deal. Okay, we have removed that method and any code that was used from @lukechilds child. We just spent 3 more hours to write the own code, test and rebuild to close the issue. 

Moreover, we don‚Äôt use the additional commission to own address for a claim using Ledger, as it was in @hyperDEX and @lukechild code. We are contributing solution for the Komodo community that covers customer needs, but not earning money from the users for the network basic functions.

I appreciate for the support of Magnum all of you and all the valuable feedback that we've got. It gives us the opportunity to make the Magnum even better. I wish good luck to @hyperDEX and @lukechilds child on their own way of contribution, using customer's comission.

welp there ya go, it's not rocket science to copy paste someone else's code without attribution then re-constitute it to be legally safe. It's like an episode of Silicon Valley. Thanks for dropping by @Magnum Wallet


[11-Dec-18 09:12 PM] lukechilds#2707
@Magnum Wallet I just checked your JavaScript bundle. You haven‚Äôt removed our code, you‚Äôve renamed the function and moved some of the code around in what seems like a pretty poor attempt at trying to obfuscate it so I didn‚Äôt notice.

You now have the following method bundled in your code:

```‚Ä®{
    key: "kmdCalculateRewards",
    value: function(t, e, r, n) {
        var i = t - e,
            o = Math.floor(i / 60),
            a = 0;
        return r < 7777777 && e >= 5e8 && o >= 60 && (r >= 1e6 && o > 44640 ? o = 44640 : (o > 525600 && (o = 525600), o -= 59), a = Math.floor(n / 10512e3) * o), Math.max(0, Math.floor(a))
    }
}
```

It uses the same same variables in the same order with the same checks in the same order and the exact same mathematic operations in a slightly different order as our original code.

You‚Äôve literally just changed the name and moved the code to the opposite branches of the condition.

If the original code was:

```‚Ä®if(check == false) {
  return 0;
}

return doCalculation();‚Ä®```

You‚Äôve essentially changed it to:

```‚Ä®if(check == true) {
  return doCalculation();
}

return 0;‚Ä®```

After the code has been bundled and minified the code looks different but if you follow the resulting operations step by step it‚Äôs clear that that‚Äôs all that‚Äôs been changed. Did you really think I wouldn‚Äôt notice that?

So not only have you copied our code without attribution, when called out on it you‚Äôve tried to obfuscate it and claim it as your own. This is a pretty shitty thing to do.


[11-Dec-18 09:13 PM] lukechilds#2707
```‚Ä®I want to emphasise that its blockchain method, but not the know-how of the third party.‚Ä®```

Why? Why do you want to emphasise that you haven‚Äôt benefitted from our work? Why are you so adamantly against giving any attribution? Did you not benefit from our ‚Äúknow-how‚Äù getting the changes necessary into the Ledger firmware to make all of this even possible?

And when asked to respect the MIT license, why wouldn‚Äôt you just add attribution? Why would you instead ‚Äúdelete‚Äù the code and implement it ‚Äúyourself‚Äù to avoid having to add attribution? Our solution is open source and free to use, even in closed source applications like yours. The MIT license allows that. You just need to provide attribution. Seems like a rather strange and pointless course of action to take.


[11-Dec-18 09:13 PM] lukechilds#2707
```‚Ä®It saved us about 1 hour. It‚Äôs not a rocket science to implement a known function that is described in the documentation I can say.‚Ä®```

I‚Äôm not claiming it‚Äôs rocket science, but it wasn‚Äôt just a 1 hour job either and it‚Äôs not described in documentation. I don‚Äôt recall exactly but I think it took me a few days to understand how it worked, implement it and test it thoroughly against the `komodod` consensus rules. There is no documentation on how the reward claim works at the low level like you claim, that‚Äôs why it took me so long to implement. There is only the Komodo implementation for reference: https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/dev/src/komodo_interest.h which is a little hard to follow as it also seems to contain a lot of other code important for enforcing consensus or legacy reasons which isn‚Äôt really relevant in a client implementation. I‚Äôm sure @jl777c remembers me picking his brain over every other line of code to make sure I correctly understood what it did as I was implementing it.

I also used the JavaScript implementation by @pbca26 and the PHP implementation by @CHMEX as reference. They were a great help (thanks guys) but neither of those implementations follow the Komodo consensus perfectly. That is testament to the fact that it‚Äôs not a straight forward 1 hour job to implement. As far as I‚Äôm aware, our implementation is the only client implementation that follows the `komodod` consensus rules perfectly.

[11-Dec-18 09:13 PM] lukechilds#2707
So based on the facts, I see only two possibilities that can result in this outcome:

Possibility 1

You have access to this secret documentation you mention that explains in detail how the reward claim functionality works at a low level. You used this documentation along with your impressive programming skills to implement a JavaScript solution that by some crazy coincidence is identical to ours in every way apart from inverting the conditional logic. You do all of this and test it against the consensus rules in a single hour.

Possibility 2

You copied our code, attempted to obfuscate it so I wouldn‚Äôt notice, and failed dramatically.

I‚Äôll let the community decide which they think is the most realistic possibility.

You‚Äôve made it clear you don‚Äôt intend to honour our license and provide attribution so I don‚Äôt see any point in continuing to be involved in this discussion.

I‚Äôm speaking on behalf of myself only and am not an official part of the team here @Magnum Wallet. This action only serves to alienate you from the kmd community. The right thing to do would be to simply give credit where credit is due. You copied the code, and distributed it as your own. That much you have acknowledged.

Here is how I see it... we can let @Magnum Wallet take a shit on the efforts of this community or we can make an example of them


[12-Dec-18 06:15 AM] actionslacks#4072
I am fully prepared, with the support of @hyperDEX and @lukechilds to file suit against @Magnum Wallet for lack of attribution


[12-Dec-18 06:16 AM] actionslacks#4072
I am perfectly within my rights to do so and will cover all legal costs herein

`we can let @Magnum Wallet take a shit on the efforts of this community or we can make an example of them`
That's not even a question at this point, imo
From my perspective, the **main** thing is to ensure that the actions of a 3rd party (specifically @Magnum Wallet *in this instance*) do not get conflated with the action of someone in this ecosystem using that 3rd party (specifically @PTYX  *in this instance*).
It's important to keep the initial lack of 2 text sentences distinctly separate from any blatant action after license was more than well known


[12-Dec-18 06:20 AM] actionslacks#4072
Look, the fucking ledger thing has been a thorn in the paw of kmd for YEARS


[12-Dec-18 06:20 AM] PTYX#6840
If i was magnum, i would drop Komodo and move on. I wouldn't want to deal with this sort of community. One that blames and points fingers at the command or because of pure bias.


[12-Dec-18 06:20 AM] PTYX#6840
they were the first to create a wallet to claim interest with the ledger without having to expose your keys


[12-Dec-18 06:20 AM] PTYX#6840
they are working on fixing the sapling ledger app


[12-Dec-18 06:20 AM] actionslacks#4072
Luke and pondsea fixed it


[12-Dec-18 06:20 AM] PTYX#6840
regardless, they had no working gui.


[12-Dec-18 06:21 AM] actionslacks#4072
Not fucking magnu wallet


[12-Dec-18 06:21 AM] PTYX#6840
i'm not excusing or saying it's good. what i am saying is, there is pure bias here from you and a few others.


[12-Dec-18 06:21 AM] PTYX#6840
honestly, that's what i will recommend to magnum. to drop komodo and keep chainzilla.


[12-Dec-18 06:21 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`If i was magnum, i would drop Komodo and move on.`
If Luke's current accusation is correct, I can't say that I believe that to be a bad thing


[12-Dec-18 06:22 AM] PTYX#6840
then the users wont have any gui to claim until luke or someone else created it.


[12-Dec-18 06:22 AM] PTYX#6840

[12-Dec-18 06:43 AM] PTYX#6840
None of my funds are going into mm2. What is going in though is a full time staff trying to onboard projects on Komodo and find companies that want to build apps on the platform. I am not on a Komodo payroll, I am not part of the internal channels. We are a separate entity.


[12-Dec-18 06:44 AM] actionslacks#4072
Well so as far as core kmd investors are concerned would you agree to defer to someone like @hyperDEX ?


[12-Dec-18 06:45 AM] PTYX#6840
I dont have anything to prove how much pondsea spent on hyperdex

but as far as I know, that's his major contribution to the project.

Oh he is also a notary node.


[12-Dec-18 06:46 AM] actionslacks#4072
Well he spent a bunch on claiming ledger rewards as well and that is why we are having this conversation

The optics are not flattering to your project or magnum wallet


[12-Dec-18 06:48 AM] PTYX#6840
I think you are lumping two things into one problem with the goal of dragging chainzilla into the conversation


[12-Dec-18 06:49 AM] PTYX#6840
i've recommended the magnum team to drop Komodo. To drop the fix for the sapling ledger app, and to just focus on other platforms.


[12-Dec-18 06:49 AM] PTYX#6840
as a business man, these situations are not favorable in the sense that it creates divisions in the community


[12-Dec-18 06:49 AM] actionslacks#4072

[12-Dec-18 09:55 PM] lukechilds#2707
@jl777c is there an initial block height that interest was activated?


[12-Dec-18 09:56 PM] lukechilds#2707
aka, if there is a UTXO from block 2 that still hasn't been spent, should it have accrued interest?


[12-Dec-18 09:56 PM] lukechilds#2707
or is there a certain checkpoint where interest started?


[12-Dec-18 10:12 PM] lukechilds#2707
because if I need to account for that and someone has a really old UTXO in their wallet since before interest was activated, I'm going to try and credit them with a years worth of interest on that UTXO in the claim transaction. If that's not how the `komodod` consensus rules work then it'll ended being an invalid transaction.

Just wondering if I need to add a:

```
if (height < KOMODO_INTEREST_START) {
  return 0;
}
```

check to account for this


[13-Dec-18 01:23 AM] jl777c#5810
height 1 is the start, but it is capped at one year

Btw @CHMEX you might want to consider adding a license to that repo.

Any code that doesn‚Äôt specify a license is automatically considered "all rights reserved" by its author. You could technically assert your copyright at any time in the future and demand people stop using it. So not including a license is actually more likely to stop people using it than encourage use.

If you cba to think about it and don't really care I'd recommend the MIT license. That's what Bitcoin/Zcash/Komodo use and it's what I use for all my projects.

It basically means you waive all rights to the code, anyone can use it for anything without asking you for permission. The only requirement is that they provide attribution to you (normally by distributing the license file with you name in inside their work).

@jl777c looking through recent transactions it looks like I just need to set the version byte to `4` instead of `1`. Is that the case? Literally just the version byte needs changing and nothing else? Or do I need to change the way the transaction is structured at all?


[24-Dec-18 12:57 AM] lukechilds#2707
ahh fuck


[24-Dec-18 12:58 AM] lukechilds#2707
that's probably going to completely break Ledger support :/


[24-Dec-18 12:59 AM] lukechilds#2707
@Deleted User are there any docs you can point me to on how transactions need to be formed?


[24-Dec-18 01:01 AM] lukechilds#2707
All transactions are created and signed on the actual Ledger device itself


[24-Dec-18 01:01 AM] lukechilds#2707
so we can't use a client side lib


[24-Dec-18 01:02 AM] lukechilds#2707

identical


[24-Dec-18 01:29 AM] jl777c#5810
other than rewards


[24-Dec-18 01:30 AM] lukechilds#2707
Great, ok, looks like Ledger support Zcash so we should be able to get Ledger support back fro Komodo without too much trouble


[24-Dec-18 01:31 AM] lukechilds#2707
although I think it will require Ledger firmware changes


[24-Dec-18 01:31 AM] jl777c#5810
i heard they are working on a release


[24-Dec-18 01:32 AM] lukechilds#2707
For Komodo or Zcash?


[24-Dec-18 01:32 AM] jl777c#5810
zcash


[24-Dec-18 01:32 AM] lukechilds#2707
I think they already support P2PKH TXs on Zcash


[24-Dec-18 01:32 AM] lukechilds#2707
just not sapling


[24-Dec-18 01:32 AM] lukechilds#2707
I don't actually know though


[24-Dec-18 01:32 AM] lukechilds#2707

[24-Dec-18 01:43 AM] lukechilds#2707
what is the difference between sapling and overwinter btw?


[24-Dec-18 01:44 AM] lukechilds#2707
I see two branches on Ledger's GitHub `zcash_sapling` and `zcash_overwinter`


[24-Dec-18 01:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
dm `zcash_overwinter` branch is merged in to `zcash_spaling`


[24-Dec-18 01:48 AM] lukechilds#2707
and they are activating it for Komodo too

[24-Dec-18 02:02 AM] jl777c#5810
overwinter did some (or all?) of the txformat changes, but had no sapling. but it applies to taddr also


[24-Dec-18 02:03 AM] jl777c#5810
sapling has overwinter active and also of course does sapling tx


[24-Dec-18 02:03 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, one of the new fields in the tx serialization is the net change in sapling funds, so for overwinter that was either not there or always 0

ok thanks

@jl777c I played around with ledgers overwinter branch firmware a bit more and managed to get it to sign a TX


[03-Jan-19 01:42 AM] lukechilds#2707
there are still no docs on how to use it and Ledger haven't got back to me


[03-Jan-19 01:42 AM] lukechilds#2707
But I think it might be a kind of frankenstein half legacy half overwinter TX


[03-Jan-19 01:43 AM] lukechilds#2707
This is the hex I got out of the Ledger:

```

```


[03-Jan-19 01:44 AM] lukechilds#2707
and instead of the normal error:

```
16: tx-overwinter-active
```

I got this:

```
TX decode failed. Code:-22
```


[03-Jan-19 01:45 AM] lukechilds#2707
so obvs looks like I've got it to mangle the TX


[03-Jan-19 01:46 AM] lukechilds#2707
but if you have a chacne to take alook at the hex and could give me any pointers as to where the TX is mangled that might help me figure out how to get overwinter working with Ledger

if cfd72d5c is locktime


[03-Jan-19 05:16 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
where it used to be
```hashOutputs (32-byte hash)

it's now

Unfortunately, due to the hardfork there are some updates required to the Ledger firmware before it can sign transactions properly. But once the @LedgerHQ team have that sorted we're ready to rock and roll!

`I'm assuming the outputscript has the same format with overwinter TXs right?`
afaik, basically it's the tx "container" (for lack of a better descriptive term) that changed and the description of the tx (ins and outs) is still the same

@ComputerGenie yeah that makes sense

[04-Jan-19 03:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
I finally got it to sign an overwinter TX


[04-Jan-19 03:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
but only with none overwinter UTXOs


[04-Jan-19 03:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
and only without locktime


[04-Jan-19 03:48 AM] lukechilds#2707
setting locktime or using overwinter UTXOs produces a mangled TX

Magnum team pushed the fix for the Ledger app to the ledger team around a week ago. Ledger  responded and said it would be merged in the first 2 weeks of January. So ledger tx's should start working again after that is added.

@PTYX That's odd, the Magnum CTO has been talking to me directly on the Ledger Dev Slack asking for help and said he hasn't been able to sign an overwinter TX yet, I managed it by just reading through the source and have been working with the Ledger CTO to fix the remaining bugs.

Also there is no PR submitted by Magnum regarding to overwinter support as you claim: https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-btc/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc

And the current overwinter branch has no one's work in it apart from the Ledger CTOs and my own: https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-btc/compare/zcash_sapling

Can you back up your claim at all?

Because as far as I can tell, I've been working with Ledger to get this functionality working, and you/Magnum seem to be trying to take credit for it (again)

@Deleted User 

```
EmmanuelYesterday at 20:20
That means that we'll have it first, before Zcash?
```

Zcash and Komodo share the same codebase. Once they have overwinter/sapling support working they'll likely roll it out to both coins at the same time

hey @lukechilds got a question by-proxy:   would it be hard to have a KMD ledger app compatiable with smart phones after ledger goes live with your updates?   e.g. https://www.ledger.com/pages/ledger-nano-x

Ledger Nano X - Secure your crypto
Make sure your crypto assets are safe anywhere you go with our most advanced hardware wallet yet. The Ledger Nano X is a bluetooth enabled secure device that stores your private keys and offers an easy-to-use experience for crypto owners.

[07-Jan-19 09:52 PM] lukechilds#2707
@Mylo I've actually been discussing this with the Ledger team internally.

I can't confirm for definite but I'm fairly sure that I should be able to get our Ledger reward claiming app working with both Nano S and Nano X on both Desktop and mobile.

although this would be limited to browsers that support Web Bluetooth which is currently only Chrome for Android on smartphones


[07-Jan-19 09:53 PM] lukechilds#2707
so no iOS support


[07-Jan-19 09:54 PM] lukechilds#2707
but we could add iOS support by building a native app if there is enough interest and I can get funding


[07-Jan-19 09:54 PM] lukechilds#2707
but that's a load more work and I don't think it's a good option


[07-Jan-19 09:55 PM] lukechilds#2707
either Apple should pull their finger out and support Web Bluetooth in which case it will just work, or iOS users will have to use a desktop to claim

Thx for reply


[08-Jan-19 03:27 PM] lukechilds#2707
Np


[08-Jan-19 03:27 PM] lukechilds#2707
Also worth noting, I think the Nano X should be usable over USB in the exact same way the Nano S is


[08-Jan-19 03:28 PM] lukechilds#2707
So if people are looking to upgrade then it should just work with no changes


[08-Jan-19 03:28 PM] lukechilds#2707
Additional changes will only be required for Bluetooth/mobile support


[08-Jan-19 03:28 PM] lukechilds#2707
Obviously that's untested though, just going on what I've heard from Ledger devs

@ComputerGenie would you be able to take a look at this?


[11-Jan-19 02:15 AM] lukechilds#2707
from your last message:

```
ComputerGenie „ÉÑ03/01/2019
000000000000000000000000000000cfd72d5c
looks like it needs to be
cfd72d5c000000000000000000000000000000
if cfd72d5c is locktime
where it used to be
hashOutputs (32-byte hash)
nLockTime of the transaction (4-byte little endian)

it's now
hashOutputs (32-byte hash)
nLockTime of the transaction (4-byte little endian)
nExpiryHeight of the transaction (4-byte little endian)
valueBalance of the transaction (8-byte little endian)
```


[11-Jan-19 02:15 AM] lukechilds#2707
I have a function that appears to unmangle the transactions from the Ledger


[11-Jan-19 02:16 AM] lukechilds#2707
```
const unmangleTransaction = rawtx => {
  const endLength = 38;
  const nLocktimeLength = 8;
  const endChunk = rawtx.slice(-endLength);
  const nLockTime = endChunk.slice(-nLocktimeLength);
  const fixedEndChunk = nLockTime + endChunk.slice(0, -nLocktimeLength);
  const fixedRawtx = rawtx.slice(0, -endLength) + fixedEndChunk

  return fixedRawtx;
};
```


[11-Jan-19 02:16 AM] lukechilds#2707
which seems to work


[11-Jan-19 02:17 AM] lukechilds#2707
```
rawtx
"0400008085202f890183a7fe66cc439a8e33bb63ad08dbb74acdcb68a902373398254d21d924f3c243000000006b483045022100c1bd5c4507fb3482e975052502c3b2d3bb67462ba6f1c3a417067d98082774700220439883fcad68f50014c824e311760b3d48708406153d57fe0a94f7a5deb3e1c101210242e1461aa67a0c21ba4ed65eec81b1ee3f9460cac030f3b9e0cd1da748c4ac01ffffffff0157e0673c000000001976a914dde900f38b45dad3718944fc7e949482d43e76f788ac0000000000000000000000000000008266385c"

```


[11-Jan-19 02:17 AM] lukechilds#2707
but I'm getting the end 38 chars (19 bytes)


[11-Jan-19 02:18 AM] lukechilds#2707
which doesn't quite match what you said previously about:

```
hashOutputs (32-byte hash)
nLockTime of the transaction (4-byte little endian)
nExpiryHeight of the transaction (4-byte little endian)
valueBalance of the transaction (8-byte little endian)
```

Which would imply I should be working with the last 32 chars (16 bytes)


[11-Jan-19 02:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
ah wait, I'm an idiot, my function doesn't even work


[11-Jan-19 02:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
after running a TX through my function I get:

```
An error occured:
16: mandatory-script-verify-flag-failed (Script evaluated without error but finished with a false/empty top stack element). Code:-26
```


[11-Jan-19 02:25 AM] jorian#4555
i think you forgot to do endianness correct


[11-Jan-19 02:25 AM] jorian#4555
5c386682 instead of 8266385c


[11-Jan-19 02:26 AM] jorian#4555
otherwise you'll be locking coins to GMT: Saturday, April 30, 2039 12:46:20 AM


[11-Jan-19 02:27 AM] lukechilds#2707
That gives the same error


[11-Jan-19 02:27 AM] jorian#4555
now i'm confused too


[11-Jan-19 02:27 AM] lukechilds#2707
and nLockTime has always been little endian (according to @ComputerGenie s info ‚òù ) so it should already be correct


[11-Jan-19 02:27 AM] lukechilds#2707
just the wrong position


[11-Jan-19 02:27 AM] jorian#4555
no you were right


[11-Jan-19 02:29 AM] jorian#4555
the unmangletransaction works?


[11-Jan-19 02:29 AM] lukechilds#2707
no it doesn't


[11-Jan-19 02:29 AM] lukechilds#2707
I get that error ‚òù


[11-Jan-19 02:29 AM] lukechilds#2707
But when @ComputerGenie posted before saying to swap the bytes around, I copied his suggested end bytes, whacked them on the end of my TX, and it broadcacst


[11-Jan-19 02:30 AM] lukechilds#2707
so I'm not quite sure why that isn't working now


[11-Jan-19 02:31 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
When you make the initial raw tx, where is `8266385c` coming from?


[11-Jan-19 02:33 AM] jorian#4555
i think that last part is correct though, maybe something else in the transaction is wrong?


[11-Jan-19 02:34 AM] jorian#4555
```
8266385c000000000000000000000000000000
9e6d385c000000000000000000000000000000``` top one is yours, lower one mine.


[11-Jan-19 02:38 AM] lukechilds#2707
I had assumed that was nLockTime


[11-Jan-19 02:38 AM] lukechilds#2707
all the signing is happening on the device


[11-Jan-19 02:38 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
8266385c = 5c826638 = 1552049720 = GMT: Friday, March 8, 2019 12:55:20 PM


[11-Jan-19 02:38 AM] jorian#4555
eh no


[11-Jan-19 02:39 AM] jorian#4555
5c386682


[11-Jan-19 02:40 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
ok, my bad, no ‚òï yet jorian is right


[11-Jan-19 02:40 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
so that bit is "right"


[11-Jan-19 02:40 AM] jorian#4555
maybe it is too far in history?


[11-Jan-19 02:40 AM] lukechilds#2707
it should be unixtime - 777


[11-Jan-19 02:40 AM] jorian#4555
i'm not sure what the boundaries are for setting locktime


[11-Jan-19 02:40 AM] lukechilds#2707
that was working previously


[11-Jan-19 02:41 AM] lukechilds#2707
unless the overwinter updates have broken how the ledger is calculating the nLockTime bytes


[11-Jan-19 02:41 AM] lukechilds#2707
which is quite possible


[11-Jan-19 02:41 AM] jorian#4555
do you have a txid and vout?


[11-Jan-19 02:41 AM] jorian#4555
or are there too many


[11-Jan-19 02:41 AM] lukechilds#2707
boundries are ~ 1 hour in the past


[11-Jan-19 02:41 AM] lukechilds#2707
The input data is 100% correct


[11-Jan-19 02:42 AM] lukechilds#2707
it's a bug in Ledger's new KMD overwinter upgrade


[11-Jan-19 02:42 AM] lukechilds#2707
if I don't set nLockTime, it creates a valid TX


[11-Jan-19 02:42 AM] lukechilds#2707
if I pass an nLockTime timestamp to the ledger lib


[11-Jan-19 02:42 AM] lukechilds#2707
the device creates a mangled transaction


[11-Jan-19 02:42 AM] lukechilds#2707
so I'm sure the input data is correct


[11-Jan-19 02:43 AM] lukechilds#2707
it's just a case of manually unmangling the TX bytes until Ledger fix it on their end


[11-Jan-19 02:43 AM] lukechilds#2707
which @ComputerGenie successfully did for me before


[11-Jan-19 02:44 AM] lukechilds#2707
but the app has changed since then so it might be doing other weird stuff now


[11-Jan-19 02:46 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
the `mandatory-script-verify-flag-failed` error is coming to you from what? an attempt to sign?


[11-Jan-19 02:50 AM] lukechilds#2707
no an attempt to broadcast


[11-Jan-19 02:50 AM] lukechilds#2707
the Ledger signs without error


[11-Jan-19 02:51 AM] lukechilds#2707
but is obviously doing something wrong internally without realising


[11-Jan-19 03:08 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
@lukechilds what does the raw tx look like before you sign it?


[11-Jan-19 03:37 AM] lukechilds#2707
There is none


[11-Jan-19 03:38 AM] lukechilds#2707
I just pass some params to the ledger library


[11-Jan-19 03:38 AM] lukechilds#2707
And the transaction creation and signing all happens on the device


[11-Jan-19 03:39 AM] lukechilds#2707
Sorry, on my phone out at dinner atm, will explain better when I'm back

I've not deleted applications from my ledger before update - so I think it's caused the issue during the firmware update

It should be ok if you don't upgrade the firmware, but you need to be on the latest KMD app


[18-Jan-19 12:42 AM] lukechilds#2707
You can open the app on your device and go down to "about" or "info" or something


[18-Jan-19 12:42 AM] lukechilds#2707
that will display the version


[18-Jan-19 12:42 AM] lukechilds#2707
but you'll probably have to update, the new version was released very recently

strange, maybe they are blocking the app downloads for people on older firmware versions

You can try the app anyway, if you get an error signing the transaction it means you aren't using a sapling capable device

I also have to mention the KMD experience on Ledger Live is very bad.
And I mean really bad. It works but it throws out a bunch of errors on every interaction.
Compared to Zcash which works smoothly, zero errors. Sigh.

@lukechilds  how could it be improved? are you or anyone from the team in touch with Ledger devs?

1. Every KMD tx sent out of Ledger Nano S ends up with this error "Internal process error (null)" https://imgur.com/a/8apGmxt
Actually the tx will pass through. So after you hit "Retry" another error pops up about tx already exist.

[08-Feb-19 11:31 PM] lukechilds#2707
This is incorrect:
```
While Ledger hardware wallets have supported storing Komodo for quite some time, previously it was not possible to claim the 5% Active User Reward, as it did not set a transaction LockTime which is used to calculate the rewards.
```
nLockTime is required on transactions for the outputs to accrue interest, however this wasn't the issue on the Ledger, transactions sent to the Ledger from elsewhere with nLockTime set would still accrue interest.

The issue was that actual KMD app running on the Ledger could not sign reward claim transactions because the outputs are larger than the inputs. This breaks BTC consensus rules the Ledger device would throw an error and refuse to sign.

This needed to be fixed in the KMD Ledger app (that runs on the device, not Ledger Live) before any software could get the Ledger to sign a reward claim transaction

(currently if you have a single UTXO earning rewards and then make a transactions, your change UTXO will contain your entire balance and won't have nLockime set so won't accrue rewards anymore)

Short version: Now UTXOs created by transactions originating from Ledger Live will accrue rewards


[27-Feb-19 07:16 PM] lukechilds#2707
previously they wouldn't


[27-Feb-19 07:16 PM] lukechilds#2707
Long version:


[27-Feb-19 07:20 PM] lukechilds#2707
Previously if I sent you 100 KMD fro my Agama wallet to your Ledger Live wallet, Agama will set nLockTime so the UTXOs sitting in Ledger Live will accrue rewards. You can then use our Ledger reward claim app to claim those rewards. Everything is good.

However, if I sent you that 100 KMD and you then sent 5 KMD to somebody, Ledger Live would use your 100 KMD UTXO and split it into 5 KMD to the recipient and 95 KMD back to you as change. However, it doen't set nLockTime. So now your 95 KMD balance is sitting in a change UTXO from a transaction with no nLockTime set so will no longer accrue rewards.

This PR fixes that. It makes sure all KMD transactions created by Ledger Live have nLockTime set so you can make transactions and your change UTXOs will always accrue rewards.


[27-Feb-19 07:22 PM] lukechilds#2707
It also means any recipients you pay from Ledger Live will also start earning rewards on their UTXOs

@jl777c is there a CLI method for seeing the exact reward for a spent output?


[12-Mar-19 11:36 PM] lukechilds#2707
`komodod gettxout` works great but it only works on unspent outputs


[12-Mar-19 11:36 PM] lukechilds#2707
so it's hard to reproduce in a test suite because the value is constantly changing


[12-Mar-19 11:37 PM] lukechilds#2707
would be great if I there was a way I could reference a spent output to `komodod` and it would give me the reward value when it was spent


[12-Mar-19 11:38 PM] lukechilds#2707
that way it's reproducible and much easier to test against


[12-Mar-19 11:38 PM] lukechilds#2707
any way to do this?


[12-Mar-19 11:49 PM] jl777c#5810
no easy way


[12-Mar-19 11:50 PM] jl777c#5810
would have to do it on an entire block basis based on the txfees, and if it doesnt match, wont know which tx is mismatched


[12-Mar-19 11:51 PM] jl777c#5810
it requires processing a block to know the exact value

@Strob it's safe as long as you're diligent when the ledger device asks you to confirm the outputs


[13-Mar-19 12:42 PM] Strob#3417
We must also be diligent when we accessing the webpage to make sure the address is well typed and not using special characters to confuse the user. Also there may be risks of the website itself or address being hacked...

by confirming the transaction on the physical device


[13-Mar-19 12:45 PM] Alright#0419
it's very very important that you triple check it when it does ask you to confirm


[13-Mar-19 12:46 PM] Strob#3417
Yes but the legitimate site is asking me to confirm sending my whole wallet content to a new adddress. how can I be sure that this new address is on my ledger before confirming the transaction?


[13-Mar-19 12:50 PM] Alright#0419
Ahh right, I forgot about that aspect. @lukechilds is that the only possible way to do it? I found that a bit scary as well


[13-Mar-19 12:50 PM] Alright#0419
You are right about that. I had completely forgotten that the coins are sent to a new address


[13-Mar-19 12:51 PM] PTYX#6840
It sends to a new address? i thought it sent back to the original address


[13-Mar-19 12:52 PM] PTYX#6840
i guess if you have multiple utxos though, the original address could be more than one


[13-Mar-19 12:53 PM] Strob#3417
yes in my case I had mutliple addresses and everything was sent to a single address that is different from all my previous ones


[13-Mar-19 02:03 PM] PTYX#6840
yeah maybe that can be changed to use the same address to avoid confusion


[13-Mar-19 06:09 PM] lukechilds#2707
```
It sends to a new address? i thought it sent back to the original address
```

Yeah, we send to the next unused derivation path as per the BIP44 standard. Address re-use is bad for privacy and security. I don't think sending back to the same address is a good idea but I'm open to feedback.

More information here: https://github.com/atomiclabs/ledger-kmd-reward-claim#why-do-all-my-funds-get-sent-back-to-a-new-address

And if you disagree with our decision, you can vote here: https://github.com/atomiclabs/ledger-kmd-reward-claim/issues/3

If enough people disagree with our decision then I'm definitely open to changing it.

```
how can I be sure that this new address is on my ledger before confirming the transaction?
```

One of the steps asks you to confirm the new address on your Ledger. The Ledger can't show arbitrary addresses, only addresses it can derive from it's internal private key. This provides cryptographic proof that the address shown on the device belongs to you.

If you follow all steps properly and compare the data displayed on the Ledger with the data displayed in the web app, it's impossible for a malicious site to steal your funds.

[13-Mar-19 06:17 PM] lukechilds#2707
However I understand that this makes people feel uncomfortable and they maybe don't realise that confirming the address on the device is cryptographic proof


[13-Mar-19 06:18 PM] lukechilds#2707
I'm a firm believer that if users are complaining about something it's because the app's wrong not the users (even if the users are wrong too haha), so we definitely need to try and make this more clear


[13-Mar-19 06:23 PM] lukechilds#2707
Also, just a consideration, but if we were to change the app to send back to old addresses, that could actually increase the opportunity for phishing attacks. As PTYX mentions, it gets a bit complicated when the account has multiple UTXOs across multiple different addresses.

We can send back to all the same addresses, however now instead of the users having to confirm one address that's been cryptographically derived on the device for them to check against, they have to check many. What if you have 20 addresses? You need to manually check 20 addresses on your Ledger device. It would be much easier for a phishing attack to sneak an incorrect address in here.

There's also the issue that I'm not even sure it's possible to click through 20 outputs on the Ledger without it timing out over the Web API. Which means the user has no choice but to blindly accept or not confirm at all due to timing out.


[13-Mar-19 06:25 PM] lukechilds#2707
One way we could mitigate this is instead of claiming per-account, you claim per address. However that could be very tedious and time consuming if you've a lot of addresses. Considering Ledger Live is a BIP44 wallet so every transaction is +1 address and +1 UTXO


[13-Mar-19 06:26 PM] lukechilds#2707
So yeah, we have considered all options, and I'm confident that what we have now is the easiest, safest and least error prone way of doing it.


[13-Mar-19 06:26 PM] lukechilds#2707
But it is kind of confusing, hopefully this helps people understand our reasoning


[17-Mar-19 11:43 AM] Strob#3417
@lukechilds Thanks for clarifying! So "The Ledger can't show arbitrary addresses, only addresses it can derive from it's internal private key." I believe you but is there any doc about this on the ledger website?


[17-Mar-19 11:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
I'm not aware that they specifically state this anywhere but you can see how the API is used in the docs:

http://ledgerhq.github.io/ledgerjs/docs/

search for "getWalletPublicKey(path, verify, segwit)" and open that section up, you'll see the first argument is a BIP32 derivation path. There's no API method to pass in an arbitrary address to display. You can only pass a derivation path that will be derived on the device and then the resulting address will be displayed.


[01-Apr-19 11:44 AM] Senda#7983

[01-Apr-19 05:27 PM] lukechilds#2707

Ledger are aware of the issue and will release new apps for the Ledger to resolve this


[01-Apr-19 05:28 PM] lukechilds#2707

lukechilds
thanks for you answers
also, re the devisor
I'm still not quite sure what exactly this is
when you get a value and devide it by a deviser it gives you the interest per minute, right?
so you can multiply that up for the duration of minutes to find the total interest amount
how did you actually calculate the value 10512000?
would just like to make the meaning a bit more clear in my code so I understand it when I come back to it

jl777c
it does all the multiplying and dividing needed to end up at 5% APR
i just combined numerator and denominator constants into a single one, but this way it avoids any overflow/underflow issues
in essence it is a constant. if you use half its value, then it will be 10% APR
if you use double the value 2.5% APR
it is just the constant that calculates 5% APR when used in the equation where it is
365 * 24 * 60 / 10512000 = 0.05
it is the divisor to use on the minutes in a year to get 5%
```

@Deleted User you are trying to claim too many rewards


[02-Jun-19 03:16 AM] jorian#4555
do a getrawtransaction on the txid and sum the interest and the amount

There is a vout

@lukechilds is claiming via the new ledger nano x also possible with your App ?


[06-Jun-19 12:20 AM] lukechilds#2707
@Acura I've not tested but it should be possible over USB

Announcement, the Atomic Labs Ledger reward claim app is now free to use üéâ

In light of recent events we want to encourage more secure asset storage, so hopefully this can convince a few more people to move over to hardware wallets, and give the users who are now moving over an easy way to claim.

It‚Äôs totally free, we take no cut, try it out: https://atomiclabs.github.io/ledger-kmd-reward-claim/

You have @hyperDEX  (Pondsea) mainly to thank for this. He funded me to develop it out of his own pocket and was hoping to make his money back with the fees. He‚Äôs nowhere near breaking even but has decided to remove the fees for the benefit of the community.

For all the paranoid people out there, use the ledger app to see what the next address will be, then use the claim app, verify it is the same, then verify when you doing the claim the address is yet again the same on the ledger as the one on screen then send it

[09-Jul-19 03:03 PM] butthole.finance#0577
hey all, we are currently building the new main komodo site which will include a rewards calculator. my understanding is that the rewards rate is annual 0.05116 rate paid out on a monthly basis. i just want to make sure i have my formula correct:

K * (1+0.05116/12) ^ M

where K = # of Komodo you start with and M = # of months you are projecting


[09-Jul-19 03:04 PM] butthole.finance#0577
i'm looking at this page and it doesn't seem to be correct: https://www.atomicexplorer.com/#/rewards-calc
all this page is doing is K * (1 + 0.05116/12 * M) which neglects your compounding rewards


[10-Jul-19 08:21 AM] butthole.finance#0577
@Deleted User got some help from JL, i have the right equation, just not the right rate of 0.05 annually. projected months means how many months you're projecting your interest


[10-Jul-19 08:23 AM] butthole.finance#0577
thank you though!

@Deleted User you just keep exporting pubkey. Once you send it, it will combine all the UTXO so the next time you do it wont be as annoying

what requests does this server fulfill? is there a way to do it locally?


[04-Nov-19 02:46 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, would be better if users could run the claim app locally. @hyperDEX said an app like this might be released a while ago.


[04-Nov-19 03:17 AM] lukechilds#2707
All good now


[04-Nov-19 03:17 AM] lukechilds#2707
@jl777c @SHossain it's just a standard insight node


[04-Nov-19 03:18 AM] lukechilds#2707
we just spun up our own instance with generous API limits because BIP44 account discovery requires a lot of requests and all the existing API servers banned us if we tried to use them


[04-Nov-19 03:19 AM] jl777c#5810
you might consider using libnspv, it supports a similar dataset as insight


[04-Nov-19 03:19 AM] lukechilds#2707
but anyone can run the app locally and point it to their own local insight server or another remote insight server

[04-Nov-19 03:22 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, using p2p protocol


[04-Nov-19 03:23 AM] jl777c#5810
i have heard that it builds via wasm, but not familiar with the details


[04-Nov-19 03:23 AM] lukechilds#2707
that's really cool


[04-Nov-19 03:23 AM] lukechilds#2707
but yeah, you'd still need some sort of browser <=> komodo network bridge


[04-Nov-19 03:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
even if it builds with wasm it'll likely be using websockets to communicate so it'll be on it's own isolated browser network until a bridge node connects the websocket/komodo networks together


[04-Nov-19 03:25 AM] lukechilds#2707
where are all the indexes stored?


[04-Nov-19 03:25 AM] lukechilds#2707
do you need special fully indexed full nodes that are indexing all addresses?


[04-Nov-19 03:25 AM] jl777c#5810
on fullnodes that support it


[04-Nov-19 03:25 AM] lukechilds#2707
are they indexing everything like insight/electrum?


[04-Nov-19 03:26 AM] jl777c#5810
it uses the same -addressindex that insight explorers are calling


[04-Nov-19 03:26 AM] jl777c#5810
insight is just a html front end to the -addressindex calls


[04-Nov-19 03:27 AM] jl777c#5810
the DB is inside the komodod, not the insight, at least there is no need for a DB at the insight level as the addressindex rpc calls returns all the relevant info


[04-Nov-19 03:28 AM] lukechilds#2707
that's awesome


[04-Nov-19 03:28 AM] lukechilds#2707
do you know why addressindex isn't supported in bitcoin core?


[04-Nov-19 03:32 AM] jl777c#5810
do you know why 4MB blocks arent supported in bitcoin legacy?


[04-Nov-19 03:32 AM] jl777c#5810
even though segwit blocks can be 4MB in size


[04-Nov-19 03:52 AM] lukechilds#2707
because there wasn't consensus to hardfork to a bigger block size


[04-Nov-19 03:53 AM] lukechilds#2707
genuinely interested in the reasoning behind `-addressindex` being rejected though


[04-Nov-19 03:55 AM] jl777c#5810
why do they deprecate rpc that is universally used?


[04-Nov-19 04:09 AM] lukechilds#2707
Cos bitcoin-cli RPC sucks and rather than keep bloating the same methods they add new more specific ones


[04-Nov-19 04:10 AM] lukechilds#2707
if you don't know the reason why no worries, I just assumed there was some history behind it as I'm sure BitPay tried to get it merged in but Googled and can't find a PR or any more info on it


[04-Nov-19 04:13 AM] jl777c#5810
you can try to justify changing how an existing rpc call works and making a different rpc call that worked the way it used to, but really there is no excuse for such breaking of backward compatibility. just make new functionality have new rpc, and dont break the existing


[04-Nov-19 04:43 AM] lukechilds#2707
normally the old RPC calls are deprecated but still accessible to not break existing applications. Then are completely removed in a later version once people have time to update to avoid an infinitely increasing maintenance burden. I think that's reasonable.

What is the "Browser Support" option and what is its purpose?
In the settings of each wallet application on your Nano S or on your Blue, you can see the "Browser support" option. This setting is helpful to switch from using your Ledger device with i...

@SHossain i think the website just is a copy of the code from my site. I think there is a issue with the insight db which is causing the issue. If pbca26 can point to a up to date insight, that should fix the issue or wait for luke to fix it

yes, it is.

that's at the bottom. so, Atomic Labs code was used as base and pbcca26 added Trezor support

@KOSIUS how many key exports do you complete approx. until it errors?
with small amount of exports it seems to work fine on 1.6.0 fw

[28-Nov-19 12:33 AM] pbca26#5430
i was able to circumvent the issue by switching to webusb
use this link if your nano s is on fw 1.6.0
https://pbca26.github.io/hw-kmd-reward-claim/#ledger-webusb
webusb has a different workflow, less confirmations from user but also seems more stable
doesn't to constantly timeout so far compared to u2f
i've tested it on chrome 78, should work on lower versions in theory
opera won't do

I have the ledger firmware updated to 1.6.0, I use the USB connection and I have updated Crome to the latest version.
I claim reward with the version of pbca26 and the result is the same: REJECT in Ledger display and Error, Ledger device is unavailable! in the api.
Will it be fixed soon or maybe it is better to claim the rewards at the moment using two ledger devices and the BIP 39 Mnemonic code converter?


[28-Nov-19 06:03 AM] pbca26#5430
which os are you using and at which step you get the error @Elmis 
i've tried chrome 78 on mac and win 10, both worked fine
i assume you opened kmd app on ledger as well? that could also be a reason for "Ledger device is unavailable!" error

also, make sure to allow chrome to access nano s
you should see similar popups if you click in the lock icon
one screen is after connect approval and one is prior to that

Im using windows 10 the newest chrome and updated firmware.   Pop ups are allowed as well, Any ideas where i am going wrong?

@yeamanjam @Elmis can you both try to "Hold down Ctrl and press F5" while on
https://pbca26.github.io/hw-kmd-reward-claim/#ledger-webusb. In case it still won't work clear browser cache manually. If you still see U2F error it indicates that webusb fix is not activated on your end for some reason. If you're unable to connect nano s as depicted here https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/502811530002300939/649611344861200394/Screen_Shot_2019-11-28_at_5.02.10_PM.png it also means webusb fix is not enabled.

kmd electrum wallet is another option if you don't like chrome
it's still in pre-beta phase though
on a bright side you can avoid connectivity issues with ledger

@SHossain @hastrup you might be interested in trying it out
use only teeny tiny amounts for any valuable assets
anyone who is going to try it consider it a 3rd party app for now

[10-Apr-20 07:41 AM] pbca26#5430
i'll check the issues you reported @SHossain 
perhaps there's a way to suppress change address prompt on trezor


[10-Apr-20 07:42 AM] SHossain#0007
change address is the default behaviour. there is an option in the tool to use old address though. i just went with all default options


[10-Apr-20 07:43 AM] SHossain#0007
that prompt is not harmful. it would be just confusing to users. if you edit the sentence, it might make more sense


[10-Apr-20 07:46 AM] pbca26#5430
on ledger i can control user prompt when generating change address
need to look through docs if it's doable on trezor as well
trezor popups are handled by trezor connect lib not by the app

great, thanks for trying @SHossain 
our qa battalion already conducted tests on both ledger and trezor devices
hopefully people will use it in voting process and report bugs/make comments so we can polish and improve it for mass use
as far as the code is concerned it doesn't matter which asset is used for testing
all of them should work fine except for ZILLA and OOT
kmd support is also coming this month

amazing üôÇ


[25-Apr-20 05:29 AM] SHossain#0007
@pbca26 one thought bugging me about this. if we send smartchain #1 to an external address and remaining coins ends up in new change address. send the same chain again, it ends up in another new change address. when i have another smartchain #2 still sitting on the first address. this can be bit messy if user doesn't remember which smartchains he/she has on that Ledger/Trezor HW wallet.
So, my query would be would you create a dashboard where all supported coins with balance be listed? it would make life a lot easier for ends users.

yes you're right, unfortunately ff lists webusb related api as not supported in their docs
although trezor seem to be working fine in ff but i'm not sure which transport layer are they using
i've tried chromium on mac, u2f didn't work
webusb on the other hand worked fine

added ledger model/firmware selectors to https://pbca26.github.io/hw-kmd-reward-claim for ease of use
similar to how it's done on hw-kmd-wallet
using specific urls to enable webusb support for ledger is no longer required
next week i'm going to focus on making it (claim tool) mobile friendly
i'm pretty positive it will work on android but quite unsure about ios as apple doesn't like to make dev life easier üôÇ

https://pbca26.github.io/hw-kmd-reward-claim now can be used on android devices
only ledger nano s and nano x supported
ios support is not possible at the moment
unfortunately trezor owners will have to wait until trezor devs implement 3rd party support for mobile
although i think in future nano x via bluetooth is feasible to add
at this point there are several blockers on both ledger and trezor sides that i'm waiting to be resolved in order to improve mobile support
also, you will need to have otg cable to use claiming util on android
below is a video depicting me claiming rewards on android + nano s
tested on android 8 and 9

@SHossain how is the trezor support? I have a unused one, might be worth playing with it.


[30-May-20 03:52 AM] SHossain#0007
Trezor support is amazing. Works almost same as the Ledger. But, only thing is, Trezor doesn't have web USB support. So, only Ledger works with Android devices

happy to maintain and improve the project @hyperDEX 
it had very good bones so it was just a matter to dev it further
on linux you might need to add udev rules and use chrome/chromium/brave
the main hurdle with multisig is handling comms between signers
however psbt seems to be aiming to solve that problem
i already peeked into it, might work on that in future
for the time being you can use electrum wallet it has multisig support out of the box
although no one tested it yet üòÑ

quick heads up
if you update your trezor to the latest firmware it will break kmd/sc signing (read you won't be able to claim rewards/send coins)
i already commented on this new issue https://github.com/trezor/connect/issues/594
not sure how much time is it going to take for trezor devs to acknowledge the issue

ledger owners that are already updated or planning to update your firmware and btc/kmd apps
you will notice a warning message about untrusted inputs until i update the code

Hi there, claimed rewards with ledger nano s, had to use chrome as Firefox wouldn't work.
Balance won't update on ledger live.
Is showing the correct receive address on live and blockchain.


[12-Jun-20 04:53 AM] gcharang#6833
> had to use chrome as Firefox wouldn't work
yes, this is expected. only chrome is completely supported. ymmv on other browsers
> Balance won't update on ledger live
they might be updating their servers for the upcoming hardfork


[12-Jun-20 05:02 AM] V__C#6587
@gcharang thanks 
Is it safe to assume sending from live is fine ?


[12-Jun-20 05:07 AM] gcharang#6833
if it doesn't show live balance, you shouldn't use it. also, I don't think sending directly from ledger live sets locktime

Ok great.
It has been fine before for setting lock time.
Do you know if magnum sets lock time?

I haven't used it. but I am guessing that it does because it has reward claiming support

@V__C sending from Magnum does set lock time - but i seem to recall you need to make sure to claim reward first or your reward can be lost to the miners (also just tried to claim via Magnum and there is a U2F error, so not really a workable solution at the moment (for me at least)

@pbca26  so it doesnt matter about the KMD app, Bitcoin needs to be updated

The vulnerability is fixed from version 1.4.0 of the Bitcoin app (being used as a library by the other apps.)


[15-Jun-20 12:45 AM] pbca26#5430
correct @hyperDEX 
however it might be a good idea to keep all ledger apps up to date just to be on a safe side


[15-Jun-20 12:47 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I think that is where i was confused, i downloaded the KMD app which means nothing without updating BTC


[15-Jun-20 12:48 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Im guessing if you dont send/claim funds it shouldnt matter


[15-Jun-20 12:48 AM] hyperDEX#6586

i've tested kmd claiming tool with both apps updated to v1.4.2

You tipped @pbca26 **5 KMD**


[18-Jun-20 06:52 AM] pbca26#5430
i'm not following your question @hyperDEX 
@miles can you elaborate or better provide some screenshots depicting the issue?
there can be a slight difference between various websites/tools depending on an actual rewards calc implementation


[18-Jun-20 08:52 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@pbca26 using ledger wallet to have asset chain coins


[18-Jun-20 08:52 PM] hyperDEX#6586
or managing them


[19-Jun-20 02:03 AM] miles#6381
@hyperDEX - Rick & Morty chains available in the HW-KMD-Wallet to test with


[20-Jun-20 08:46 AM] V__C#6587
Any ideas when Ledger Live will be fine with KMD?
It doesn't show my recent transactions, that I've made via magnum.
All my apps are up to date.


[20-Jun-20 01:27 PM] miles#6381
hi @V__C - i dont seem to be having any issue on KMD ledger live at the moment - i can see transactions showing up ok in the Ledger Live app that i made from other wallets to my ledger address - is it showing fine on the explorer?


[20-Jun-20 01:31 PM] V__C#6587
Yep it's fine on explorer.
Maybe I need to update my osx ?


[20-Jun-20 01:54 PM] miles#6381
have you got lots of coins / accounts in ledger live? you could try going to the settings / help menu and clearing the cache - it forces a clean pull of all the transactions


[20-Jun-20 01:55 PM] miles#6381
make sure you have the latest ledger live as well - i used to have a lot of issue with non KMD coins syncing in old versions - but last six months or so the app seems to be much improved

hw-kmd-wallet SC (asset chains) signing on trezor issue is fixed
the fix is propagated to hw-kmd-reward-claim as well
also, i've added a link to a wiki page (visible after vendor is selected in the app) for ledger owners using the tools for the first time
in case you have issues authorizing your ledger device please consult with this entry https://github.com/pbca26/hw-kmd-reward-claim/wiki/First-time-using-Ledger-Nano-S-(firmware-v1.6)---Nano-X
lastly, firefox and opera are no longer supported due to people having constant difficulties with them

fyi there are two firmware updates for ledger

claiming on nano x works w/o any issues after the update
however i'm unable to install 1.6.1 on my nano s for some reason (no visible update button in ledger live)
if someone installs 1.6.1 and claim rewards successfully
please let me know if everything is working as expected

If you have the nanox click on the nano s and select firmware 1.5 from the dropdown. For whatever reason that works sometimes

Otherwise what sometimes works is deinstall the nanox from hardware devices if you are on wi dows


[23-Aug-20 09:41 PM] gcharang#6833
@bushybro update your ledger firmware to latest, then confirm that your ledger live wallet recognises the device


[24-Aug-20 03:03 AM] pbca26#5430
removing/re-authorizing a device might also help if a browser doesn't recognize it after several attempts
unfortunately ledger devices are prone to a number of issues while connecting via a browser (kmd app specifically)
i'm looking for a way to improve claiming tool stability

just pushed new update to https://pbca26.github.io/hw-kmd-reward-claim

changes:
- nano x bluetooth option
- firmware/ledger kmd app version check modal

BT option is a bit wonky (hence it's flagged as experimental), you might need to reload the page after bluetooth pairing nano x
firmware check modal is optional, you can skip it and do manual selection
this is mostly to aid users not knowing which fw/ledger kmd app version they have or which ledger options to select on landing screen
if your trezor fw version or ledger app version is too old a prompt will be displayed asking to update

things don't look good for nano x + windows users
old working option was u2f but it's deprecated now
both webusb and webhid are experimental and require additional drivers/configuration
it seems electron app is the only rescue for such users, it works fine as no browser api is required in this case

most likely not. atomicdex and this app use completely different GUI technologies. if and when the atomicdex-api(mm2) supports hardware wallets, maybe pbca will integrate it into this app

thanks, i was looking for something like this also!


[24-Sep-20 03:56 PM] Sanakoev#7417
seems to work great, if i did everything right, i have to use the web wallet to connect to the Nano S, and to the desktop app to claim rewards? there is currently no one way to use just one app? (just trying to confirm that im doing everything the correct way)


[24-Sep-20 04:00 PM] Sanakoev#7417
hmm re-reading what pbca wrote, i mustve missed something...

a fix for kmd rewards button is pushed to both versions
in short a new address was derived from an internal node (change) instead of an external
now it should match hw-kmd-rewards-claim behavior
thanks to @Deleted User for reporting the difference

trying to claim rewards with Nano S using the desktop wallet, getting the following error:


[17-Oct-20 12:11 PM] Sanakoev#7417
"16: bad-txns-inputs-duplicate. Code:-26"


[17-Oct-20 12:11 PM] Sanakoev#7417
any advice? ü§î


[17-Oct-20 12:13 PM] Sanakoev#7417
it does the first 3 steps with a green checkmark in the wallet software, the 4th box is red (="broadcasting the reward claim tx to the network")

@pbca26 ^


[18-Oct-20 07:22 AM] pbca26#5430
@Sanakoev i suggest to retry
if this won't help try to select a different end point (click on cog icon in the top left corner)
i double checked explorers synced correctly
such errors can happen if explorer's spent index is not up to date or your previous transactions are in unconfirmed state

[18-Oct-20 08:18 AM] Sanakoev#7417
Changing that endpoint did seem to matter: the duplicate tx error is gone. Also, i noticed the Nano S screen showed for the first time the word "rewards", which wasnt the case before. Before, the Nano S showed the word "fees" instead (the fee was equal to my entire balance, which was a bit strange üòÇ ). The second end point now shows my new balance (=original+claimed sum), which looks good, but the first endpoint shows me a 0 balance.  i'll play around with it more in the coming weeks, to see how it behaves. Thanks a lot for the help! üëçüèª


[19-Oct-20 10:42 AM] pbca26#5430
i'm glad it helped
by the sound of it default kmd explorer might need a kick

Hi @pbca26 @Decker Two members from Marmara team will be adding three fields into explorer sites. Those are for displaying the statistics for Total Normal Coin, Total Activated and Total Locked in Credit Loops supply. They have some questions. Would you help in that? They are @Aklix and @ryilmaz.

[29-Oct-20 07:12 AM] pbca26#5430
if the cog icon is visible try another end point @Oszy 
if it's not visible please report back

doesn't work with either of the endpoints.


[29-Oct-20 07:19 AM] Oszy#5734
on the ledger at the Fee section it says REWARD not a number, is that right?


[29-Oct-20 07:20 AM] Oszy#5734

Hello all, I have two questions.


[17-Dec-20 01:33 AM] Kay Gee#2313
1. I'm trying to move my KMD from my web wallet to my hardware wallet, but I'm unable to move all of my funds as I get this warning: "Insufficient funds. Failed to calculate acceptable transaction amount with current fee."


[17-Dec-20 01:33 AM] Kay Gee#2313
is there a way to move all minus the fee?


[17-Dec-20 01:35 AM] Kay Gee#2313
2. How straight forward is it to claim interest on KMD stored on a Ledger? A dev kindly linked me an article on how to do this a few months ago, but I'm afraid I can't find that reference and I'm not too clear on what to do from the conversation above (one github link appeared to require me to grant access permissions to the Ledger, which I am VERY loathe to do...)

which web wallet?

https://pbca26.github.io/hw-kmd-wallet/
this is the recommended  webpage to claim rewards using ledger. it does need access to your pubkeys to create the required transactions. but, you will have to verify and approve the txn on your ledger device itself

can you give me a url? 
if that wallet isn't working for you, can use verus desktop or atomicdex desktop to restore your seed words

reposting here just to draw your attention to the importance of double checking every transaction you make using hw wallets
the above is a good example that you can't blindly trust any software
always verify what are you signing and broadcasting
unfortunately transaction hex (raw data) swapping and various phishing techniques can still be used agains you
hw wallets only protect your private keys
so don't fool yourself into thinking it's 100% safe to just blindly push buttons and confirm any prompts that are displayed on the screen
this is not the first time when someone lost a chunk of funds due to a "trick" and definitely not the last

@pbca26 Is there any risk of losing funds using your desktop app (0.2.1) for claming rewards?


[07-Jan-21 07:15 AM] pbca26#5430
only in case github servers are compromised and someone make changes to the app build or hosted version
in any case always verify what are you signing


[07-Jan-21 07:18 AM] stnabben#4667
Ok. Thanks. I've used the web version in the past, but now it just sits and spins. When i choose manually I get this error "unable to reset the device".

changes:
- added WSB, SOULJA, SPACE, CLC

if you're unable to see your WSB airdrop after clicking of "check balance" button (or any other coin) try the following url
https://pbca26.github.io/hw-kmd-wallet/#extgap=xl
it will override default 10 addresses gap limit bumping it to 100
this should aid active users who are transacting kmd frequently
for others it might work as is
desktop version doesn't have such override option yet

[01-Jun-21 08:11 AM] pbca26#5430
that's the problem
hw kmd wallet is a simple tool designed for a standard use case
coinbase transactions is non-standard case
you need to send coinbase inputs from elsewhere such as komodo-cli

stick to ledger then
i didn't know their api supports coinbase inputs out of the box
it's a nice added benefit for ledger users
long wait time is somewhat expected
in case of a bigger transaction size, number of inputs/outputs require processing on device side which can be a bit slow
i meant "simple" in a way that it was designed for a very narrow usage compared to electrum wallet for example

95% of projects in this space do not give a rats ass about HW wallet support

and thats probably OK for people who invest $100-$1000 in this space, but for anyone in this space for a few years already, they are likely to have accumulated more funds than the new investors

Hello I have a trezor one wallet running the most current firmware 1.10.3 and was  trying to use the hw-kmd wallet with it. I first opened https://pbca26.github.io/hw-kmd-wallet/ and select trezor, then I select "connect and unlock your trezor." The pop-up opens but the balances don't appear. I just get the loading circle and nothing shows in my dashboard.  My question is do I need the  Ocean Wallet  fully synched along with using the hw-kmd at the same time? I am unsure how to use this hardware wallet for KMD or what output i should expect from this hw-kmd wallet. Any instructions or procedures you could share would be appreciated. Thank you.

you don't need any external apps to use along with web wallet @ybcninja

Does having more accounts create more lag? I have maybe 20 accounts all with over 100 addresses used up. 

It takes 10 minutes or so to go through them. Might just make a new seed if that‚Äôs the case


[19-Oct-21 03:06 AM] pbca26#5430
it does
the more addresses are used the longer it takes to pull data
are you actively using/storing funds on all 20 accounts or any of them are empty?


[19-Oct-21 05:07 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Most empty only 2 or 3 used


[19-Oct-21 05:07 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
But for reasons I‚Äôm trying not to use the first few


[19-Oct-21 05:07 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Any solution  @pbca26


[19-Oct-21 05:46 AM] pbca26#5430
there's a workaround for the web
if you click on the gear icon it will allow you to select an account index (number)
this will effectively limit lookup to only specific account
e.g. you select account index 2 then the app will check only 2nd account
i haven't accounted for any users that can possibly have 20 accounts so you can only select from numbers 1-6 right now :abusedsmily:

@Crabby Paddy for airdrop coins it's fine to see less than expected if you're an active kmd hodler
by default app follows established standard when running address discovery
try to increase gap limit as outlined here https://github.com/pbca26/hw-kmd-wallet/wiki/How-to-use-address-discovery-options-to-claim-airdrop-coins
it should reveal more coins

@Crabby Paddy can you check in ledger live for each of the corresponding accounts where their fresh address path is at?
in order to do that open ledger live -> accounts -> select account -> press on the wrench icon -> advanced -> freshAddressPath
it should look like this "44'/141'/1'/0/10"
if you can please check all accounts that you expect the airdrop to be sitting at
perhaps your tokels are sitting deeper than the first 100 addresses

Also is there any chance this means that I could find kmd on my other seeds? I remember I‚Äôve had maybe 4 or 5 seeds in the past and sometimes it seemed like magnumwallet would pick up some kmd while the claim app didn‚Äôt or ledger didn‚Äôt see it but it was on other apps etc. 

I‚Äôve ended up missing a few thousand kmd and can‚Äôt actually figure out how or where I went wrong. Not sure if related at all üòÇ

not sure, but if you've made a deposit on an empty account and on an address that's beyond 20 consecutive empty addresses then it's possible
ledger live also has an option to increase default lookup depth


[01-Nov-21 05:29 AM] pbca26#5430
empty address = not used


[01-Nov-21 05:30 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
How does one find a consecutive address? Even if you go ‚Äúshow address‚Äù it always shows next one in line


[01-Nov-21 05:31 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Or do you mean if I‚Äôve gone past 20 addresses (all used + used to be filled) but are now empty, then the next one I use could do that?


[01-Nov-21 05:31 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
But yeah, with the Tokel is this something I can get around? Or is this something awaiting to be implemented üòÆ


[01-Nov-21 05:35 AM] pbca26#5430
i think it's best to just load your seeds an try address discovery with different settings


[01-Nov-21 05:35 AM] pbca26#5430
for tokel there's a quick fix
give me some time to add it

@Crabby Paddy updated, make sure to check page title, it should say v0.2.7a
use force reload the page if it's still v0.2.7 on your end
i bumped all limits, now you can check from 1 to 30 accounts w/ max gap limit at 200 addresses
have fun

new update v0.2.9
both web and desktop
https://github.com/pbca26/hw-kmd-wallet/releases/tag/v0.2.9

changes:
- added account management feature (enable/disable/add)

- performance and security improvements
- store vendor selection in settings
- KMD rewards overdue badge
- added ability to view account XPUB in coin settings modal

desktop users are recommended to update to new version
there was a bug in encrypted storage part that lead to serious performance degradation depending on number of coins enabled and used addresses
also, electron framework (core component) is updated to v15 which brings lots of security patches and speed improvements

don't hesitate to bug me with any issues you may find

Hi! I'm getting this error on the KMD rewards claiming on the <https://pbca26.github.io/hw-kmd-wallet/>. I use Ledger Nano S. The transaction broadcasts successfully, though. Please excuse me if this is a duplicate üôÇ

Some issues on my Mac with new version: 
- What is the password for? I can use a different one each time. Is it not saved?
- The buttons on the left side need more explaining, hover info for example. 
- When I click the second button on the left side, Github launch screen starts, but how can I go back if I don't want to login? 
- When I exit the window accidentally, how can I open a new one? Now I need to QUIT the app first and start all over again. 
Thanks for the update and good luck programming! üëç

Found another bug. The Ledger logo is staying on top of the text.

And another remark. I hate this alert: 
"Warning: This is a beta version! Please do not use it to transact any substantial amounts."


[01-Dec-21 02:54 AM] Farl#9964
When will crypto become mature? After years Ii still get warnings that it's dangerous to use certain software. How can it become mainstream like this?


[01-Dec-21 04:24 AM] SHossain#0007
i can confirm this is happening on Trezor too

new update v0.3.0
both web and desktop
https://github.com/pbca26/hw-kmd-wallet/releases/tag/v0.3.0

changes:
- fix error after successful transaction broadcast
- fix account index render in transaction details modal
- fix about modal link hover style
- RICK, MORTY change explorer url
- sidebar open Github link in a new window

thank you all for bug reports and feedback

@Farl can you please use a more common format for screenshots, png/jpeg?
>- What is the password for? I can use a different one each time. Is it not saved?
password is not stored, it's used as an encryption key
it's required to allow you to check on balances/transactions w/o connecting your hw device each time you open the app
previously you had to connect hw device every time you wanted to use the app
this is similar to how it works in ledger live
>And another remark. I hate this alert: 
that's how it is in foss üòÑ

Thanks for your reply and update! Here's the proper screenshot (I think I changed the filename in Discord and forgot the jpg-extension).

@tolken please follow this guide on how to enable advanced lookup settings to claim airdrop coins
i suggest to move your coins to fresh account after address discovery is completed
otherwise you'd have to re-enable advanced settings each time
tl;dr account discovery protocol is designed to be effective so for non standard use case scenarios such as airdrop it requires extra moves
