@opsec Welcome to the metaverse attack mitigation channel - we created this channel for the organization and dev-talk of the mitigation implementation. This attack vector looks like a serious threat against our privacy. 
We still need to validate the attack scenario and prove its indeed a practical problem. According to ZEC team this is not a problem (yes - i already asked them for help) - so based on their input it might be the case that shielded transactions are validated (only) by the sapling proof and not the prev. tx. utxo like we are assuming for the metaverse attack. My question - have we validated this in a "wildfire test"? If not, then we should likely do this first. Happy coding!


[20-Sep-19 08:49 AM] mrlynch#5735
not sure what data and tests itm has


[20-Sep-19 08:50 AM] mrlynch#5735
it would be great if we had some actual data, graphs presented in here


[20-Sep-19 09:02 AM] ca333#0333
@ITM have you already executed a PoC for the meta-verse-attack? If so - can you please share details in here. I invited all relevant and highly trusted community members and devs to this channel.

i have given him some ideas that made things so much faster that we can maybe do it in real-time


[20-Sep-19 09:04 AM] dukeleto#7326
previously, it was very slow


[20-Sep-19 09:04 AM] dukeleto#7326
@ca333 ITM says it works on ZEC 120%


[20-Sep-19 09:04 AM] ca333#0333
excellent - thanks for the heads up - once ready lets have a look on an ongoing attack and then discuss potential mitigations. Very exciting and interesting topic!


[20-Sep-19 09:04 AM] dukeleto#7326
It does not work against ARRR very well


[20-Sep-19 09:04 AM] dukeleto#7326
until we add swaps


[20-Sep-19 09:04 AM] dukeleto#7326
then, it's really bad


[20-Sep-19 09:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
HUSH is also badly effected, but since the encrypted memo field is our #1 focus, and that is untouched, it's not fatal to us


[20-Sep-19 09:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
I think this is fatal to a lot of zcash forks


[20-Sep-19 09:06 AM] dukeleto#7326 (pinned)
This was the fist backup of public info being dropped in Hush #general: `https://gist.github.com/leto/b03b152be119331f21ebe6fff340f573`


[20-Sep-19 09:06 AM] dukeleto#7326
@ca333  can you pin that and maybe give people in here ability to pin/etc?


[20-Sep-19 09:07 AM] dukeleto#7326
If you have not read that gist, do that first.


[20-Sep-19 09:07 AM] ca333#0333
Pinned a message.


[20-Sep-19 09:07 AM] dukeleto#7326
This attack technique has never been said or mentioned ever before


[20-Sep-19 09:07 AM] ca333#0333
Everyone in here should now be able to pin messages.


[20-Sep-19 09:07 AM] dukeleto#7326
I will do my best to braindump in here, to show y'all that we are not FUD'ing, at least on ZEC. XMR is an open question

This attack simulates what WOULD happen if alternate histories happened


[20-Sep-19 09:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
That is why I call it the "Multiverse Metadata Attack" (not ITMs name, he doesn't have an official name for it yet)


[20-Sep-19 09:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
you simulate alternate blockchain history


[20-Sep-19 09:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
and because of MATH, metadata drops out


[20-Sep-19 09:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
Things you should never be able to tell.


[20-Sep-19 09:09 AM] dukeleto#7326
Like the entire history of a zutxo, and a range of potential amounts, such as "this zaddr has between 1.256 and 3.464 ZEC"


[20-Sep-19 09:09 AM] dukeleto#7326
every address has more or less privacy based on the opsec of the people who owned the funds


[20-Sep-19 09:09 AM] dukeleto#7326
and some can be very tightly definied "between 1 and 1.00001 zec"


[20-Sep-19 09:09 AM] dukeleto#7326
others might be "between 5 and 10 zec"


[20-Sep-19 09:10 AM] dukeleto#7326
but then, that is just phase 0 of the attack


[20-Sep-19 09:10 AM] dukeleto#7326
How the fuck is this possible?


[20-Sep-19 09:10 AM] dukeleto#7326
Are you smoking drugs, Duke?


[20-Sep-19 09:10 AM] dukeleto#7326
I know, you must be asking yourself


[20-Sep-19 09:10 AM] dukeleto#7326
Look at block N, ignore all of history after that


[20-Sep-19 09:10 AM] dukeleto#7326
take block N+1, break it into every transaction


[20-Sep-19 09:11 AM] dukeleto#7326
now, make a fake block N+1, with just that xtn, and see if fails to connect


[20-Sep-19 09:11 AM] dukeleto#7326
if it fails to connect, what does that mean? it's not the output of anything involved in that block


[20-Sep-19 09:11 AM] dukeleto#7326
there is a cascading combinatorial explosion of work, but pretty much, the entire history of a zutxo can be figured out


[20-Sep-19 09:12 AM] dukeleto#7326
Additionally, you can do an active attack, but sending dust to zaddrs you can't resolve enough


[20-Sep-19 09:12 AM] dukeleto#7326
ITM is actively doing this to ARRR mainnet exchanges


[20-Sep-19 09:12 AM] dukeleto#7326
I have no control over this, he does what he wants. I am reporting this.

so, the transmission key


[20-Sep-19 11:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
what are the constraints on it?


[20-Sep-19 11:25 AM] mrlynch#5735
that is the equivalent of public key, yes


[20-Sep-19 11:27 AM] dukeleto#7326
@mrlynch is it valid to be non-prime or even?


[20-Sep-19 11:27 AM] dukeleto#7326
let's do this already


[20-Sep-19 11:27 AM] dukeleto#7326
make it 0, generate an address in the paper wallet


[20-Sep-19 11:27 AM] dukeleto#7326
that will give us an unspendable zutxo, pretty sure


[20-Sep-19 11:27 AM] dukeleto#7326
need to verify the RPCs allow it


[20-Sep-19 11:28 AM] dukeleto#7326
if not, use a non-prime or some other invalid number


[20-Sep-19 11:28 AM] dukeleto#7326
Hush should use a different address than Pirate, probably


[20-Sep-19 11:28 AM] dukeleto#7326
we haven't decided if they will be global, per wallet or per xtn


[20-Sep-19 11:29 AM] dukeleto#7326
per xtn might cause wallet.dat scalability problems


[20-Sep-19 11:29 AM] dukeleto#7326
per wallet might be the sweet spot between privacy and performance. maybe an optional setting to make a new one every time?


[20-Sep-19 11:37 AM] dukeleto#7326
@mrlynch i am almost certain transkeys cannot be even numbers. Choose an even number, such as 0 or it might need to be nonzero, and it should be possible to send to an address that has no corresponding transmission key to spend it


[20-Sep-19 11:37 AM] dukeleto#7326
i might be very wrong


[20-Sep-19 11:38 AM] dukeleto#7326
but it might work


[20-Sep-19 11:39 AM] mrlynch#5735
it's a bit trickier


[20-Sep-19 11:39 AM] mrlynch#5735
transmission keys don't seem to be standard such as pubkeys, beginning with 02, 03 or 04


[20-Sep-19 11:40 AM] mrlynch#5735
per tx is ideal, not sure how it will affect wallet.dat as the unspendable, in theory, is generated on the fly and not stored anywhere


[20-Sep-19 12:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
@mrlynch these zutxos will need to be in memory until all of time on each chain


[20-Sep-19 12:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
they are unspendable but the chain doesn't know


[20-Sep-19 12:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
per tx has massive scalability concerns for exchanges and pools


[20-Sep-19 12:04 PM] mrlynch#5735
the idea is to have it such as a tx fee


[20-Sep-19 12:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
what if it changed every N blocks?


[20-Sep-19 12:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
choose N to taste


[20-Sep-19 12:04 PM] mrlynch#5735
0.0001 tx fee + 0.00000001 to unspendable


[20-Sep-19 12:05 PM] mrlynch#5735
unspendable isn't required to be known


[20-Sep-19 12:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
you think?


[20-Sep-19 12:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
what do you mean, exactly?


[20-Sep-19 12:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
Sorry, I don't understand what you mean by `unspendable isn't required to be known`


[20-Sep-19 12:51 PM] mrlynch#5735
as in, it's not required to be added to wallet.dat


[20-Sep-19 12:52 PM] mrlynch#5735
you only need an address to add by default to z_sendmany and other calls that send funds on top of where you send


[20-Sep-19 01:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
@mrlynch you are right, they don't go in the local wallet.dat


[20-Sep-19 01:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
but they must be held in memory for all nodes until the end of time


[20-Sep-19 01:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
so i was wrong


[20-Sep-19 01:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
not wallet.dat scalability, but maybe node RAM scalability


[20-Sep-19 01:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
Doing every xtn can lead to an out-of-memory DoS against nodes, i think


[20-Sep-19 01:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
and really fucks up the shielded pool


[20-Sep-19 01:31 PM] mrlynch#5735
why do they have to be held in memory?


[20-Sep-19 01:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
@mrlynch where do you think the shielded pool is held? The UTXO set of Bitcoin is held in memory, and as far as I know, @jl777c plz correct me, the shielded pool is held in memory too


[20-Sep-19 01:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
changing that is massive


[20-Sep-19 01:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
also prevents nodes with less than X GB RAM from being a node


[20-Sep-19 01:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's a DoS


[20-Sep-19 01:49 PM] dukeleto#7326
we could probably measure the memory use increase of `komodod` as the chain is bombarded with zutxos


[20-Sep-19 01:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
such as: send 10 zxtns per minute, and then measure memory increase per minute


[20-Sep-19 01:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
divide by ten, you might have an estimate as to how much memory use actually incresaes per zutxo, without trying to read the spec or understand all the header files


[20-Sep-19 06:13 PM] mrlynch#5735
so you mean all sends to all addresses, ever are stored in memory?


[20-Sep-19 06:13 PM] mrlynch#5735
doesn't make much sense


[20-Sep-19 07:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
@mrlynch the node must load things from disk and operate on them in memory


[20-Sep-19 07:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
if they don't fit in memory, it all fails


[20-Sep-19 07:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
Such as git, for example


[20-Sep-19 07:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
the operation `git add` requires about 3X the RAM as the size of the file being added


[20-Sep-19 07:06 PM] mrlynch#5735
what i'm proposing is just a standard tx with a minimun of 2 sends per z_sendmany


[20-Sep-19 07:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
we are not understanding each other


[20-Sep-19 07:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's pretty frustrating, to be honest


[20-Sep-19 07:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
I will just write some code


[20-Sep-19 07:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
and Pirate can do whatevs


[20-Sep-19 07:08 PM] mrlynch#5735
1 to wherever you send, 1 to an unspendable address that is, for all intents and purposes, a valid address


[20-Sep-19 11:02 PM] ITM#7678
@ca333 Hi, I see this only now.
The attack is only z-transactions. Its just a chain of z-transactions dependencies. It chains z-transactions by reverse proofing.
If you have a tx transaction to z-transaction x 10 z-transaction. We can only proof z-transaction to 9x z-transactions. Analyzing the first couple of 10000 is misleading to say that the attack has great impact, since the bigger the blockchain the more resources is used, its exponential. Since if there 100 000 transaction unchained, we will need to proof every new z-transaction dependencies against 100 000. 
linking a txTransaction to a z-address is not compromise since there no dependencies. Only if you have meta data or your zChain included, you can determine the txOutput based on amounts. 
I am working on improving (using high and low amounts) and start to play around with txTransactions inputs to z-transactions ouput and z-transactions to txTransactions output. 

I tested it and also attempted to determined if funds moved from digitalprice to tradeogre or tradeogre to digitalprice. It was success on all 3 attempts. I am updating to see know if graviex can also be part of the list, since I received alot ARRR to play around(jl777c).


[20-Sep-19 11:06 PM] ITM#7678
All I can say is I can 100%(I say 120%) proof the chain of a z-transactions. Only the later the block chain, the resources are massive, going from block 70000 to 80000 took 8 gpu and 2 weeks


[20-Sep-19 11:13 PM] ITM#7678
Not only the attack is resource intensive but also memory intensive. So my next improvement is to optimize my code by offloading everything to gpu, second have multiple thread proofing, if we can find a solve faster, saving on resources(its more luck based, if one gpu process thread start from block 75000 and the other block 78000, we could find a solve at 78001, a solve = invalid proof and when ztx is added the solve now becomes valid)


[20-Sep-19 11:28 PM] ITM#7678
Now how will this impact Zcash/Hush - By knowing the z-transaction chain and if break up, you can then know how many splits the coin went through, by determining the zcash flow, one could determine that 25 hush went in - transaction fees, it got split into 2 and we expect to output tx + sum of transaction fees to amount to 25 hush.
Now how will it impact ARRR - Dust attacks


[20-Sep-19 11:29 PM] ITM#7678
ARRR will only be vulnerable to dust attacks or you share the chain. Not sure how important is this to privacy :P.


[20-Sep-19 11:40 PM] ITM#7678
I made one mistake through, I was only testing one input and one output. (Index was hardcorded), now added to a loop and notice my assumption to mitigate the attack by creating a dust is incorrect.
I can confirm that if you split z-transactions in one dust and one none actual spend does not secure you @jl777c. I was rewriting pieces of zcash and Never took into account uniqueness of the nullifier. Since I was always checking index[0], but I spent index[1] or index[2].


[20-Sep-19 11:50 PM] ITM#7678
txTransactions inputs to z-transactions ouputs are linked up(forms part of your transaction), so you will be able to chain ARRR Tx to Zchain. but not zchain to tx


[21-Sep-19 12:16 AM] ITM#7678
we can only predict zchain to tx, but having a high low amount(next research part), we can associate zchains to tx with higher accurancy

[21-Sep-19 04:31 AM] mrlynch#5735
@ITM so, if i understand correctly, the more transactions on chain, the harder it is for you to reverse new transactions. correct?
also, since the unspendable output (dust) is off the table, is there anything else that you have in mind for mitigation or not yet?


[21-Sep-19 04:33 AM] mrlynch#5735
i'd love to see some actual data from you, either here or in DM, just to fully understand how this works. i can make assumptions and believe i have a fair understanding of it, but assumptions are also mother of all screw ups


[21-Sep-19 04:34 AM] dukeleto#7326
There are no ZEC mining pools that show zaddrs. Pirate has less security in that regard

[21-Sep-19 04:35 AM] dukeleto#7326
I was hyperbolic


[21-Sep-19 04:35 AM] dukeleto#7326
all the current zaddrs listed on the pool have 99% chance of being outputs  in that txid

so t-address don't work, I have ask ca333 to ask zcash on why.


[21-Sep-19 04:37 AM] dukeleto#7326
@ITM no, you should ask me üôÇ


[21-Sep-19 04:37 AM] dukeleto#7326
Do not ask Zcash things


[21-Sep-19 04:37 AM] dukeleto#7326
just haven't been able to respond yet

@mrlynch there you go


[21-Sep-19 04:38 AM] mrlynch#5735
thank you @ITM


[21-Sep-19 04:38 AM] dukeleto#7326
that is a zaddr that is an output in that txid


[21-Sep-19 04:38 AM] mrlynch#5735
and you know how?


[21-Sep-19 04:38 AM] ITM#7678
@mrlynch I am cleaning(removing personal code and creating a clean base)


[21-Sep-19 04:38 AM] dukeleto#7326
@mrlynch i don't mean to be a dick


[21-Sep-19 04:38 AM] dukeleto#7326
@ITM can you explain?


[21-Sep-19 04:39 AM] dukeleto#7326
Miners get mining pool payouts, every payout.


[21-Sep-19 04:39 AM] dukeleto#7326
Since that was the most recent payout


[21-Sep-19 04:39 AM] dukeleto#7326
and that address had high hashrate


[21-Sep-19 04:39 AM] dukeleto#7326
it almost definitely was paid in that payout


[21-Sep-19 04:39 AM] dukeleto#7326
does this make sense?


[21-Sep-19 04:40 AM] dukeleto#7326
small addresses don't get paid out every time, we can account for that too


[21-Sep-19 04:40 AM] dukeleto#7326
zs1dx7glm0fgjxx20x09t68mdy0f470la5nzfhl37kq94r2arr7y4xvw8yjxc77dwjwgmtucrw7nvr is one of the largest workers


[21-Sep-19 04:40 AM] dukeleto#7326
they definitely got a payout that block


[21-Sep-19 04:40 AM] dukeleto#7326
this is the logic I am using


[21-Sep-19 04:41 AM] dukeleto#7326
since there are 230 zaddrs I just downloaded


[21-Sep-19 04:41 AM] dukeleto#7326
and 27 payouts


[21-Sep-19 04:41 AM] mrlynch#5735
then don't be one.. i'm only asking because i want to see actual data.. i don't deny the possibility, but making statements based on assumptions is a bit iffy


[21-Sep-19 04:41 AM] dukeleto#7326
we know that over 10% of miners are getting paid out each time


[21-Sep-19 04:41 AM] dukeleto#7326
@mrlynch it's not obvious to me what is hard for you to understand


[21-Sep-19 04:41 AM] dukeleto#7326
@ITM do you agree with me statements?


[21-Sep-19 04:41 AM] ITM#7678
Yes


[21-Sep-19 04:42 AM] mrlynch#5735
ü§¶ it's not the understanding part.. stop being condescending. i'm only asking for proof.. it is very easy to make assumptions


[21-Sep-19 04:43 AM] jl777c#5810
@Alright


[21-Sep-19 04:44 AM] dukeleto#7326
@mrlynch I respect your intelligence, and also, your rudimentary questions sometimes slow me down and frustrate me. That is the real deal ‚ô•


[21-Sep-19 04:44 AM] mrlynch#5735
that big hash rate worker addresses get paid every time is not a secret.. i want to see where that leads
does that make sense?


[21-Sep-19 04:44 AM] dukeleto#7326
ok


[21-Sep-19 04:44 AM] dukeleto#7326
Knowing a zaddr is an output in a txid is massive metadata leakage


[21-Sep-19 04:44 AM] dukeleto#7326
it adds to the ITM attack


[21-Sep-19 04:45 AM] dukeleto#7326
makes it much faster


[21-Sep-19 04:45 AM] dukeleto#7326
use less RAM


[21-Sep-19 04:45 AM] dukeleto#7326
less CPU


[21-Sep-19 04:45 AM] dukeleto#7326
and resolve data better


[21-Sep-19 04:45 AM] mrlynch#5735
my rudimentary questions as you put it are supposed to slow you down a bit


[21-Sep-19 04:45 AM] dukeleto#7326
yes, I know


[21-Sep-19 04:45 AM] dukeleto#7326
my brain moves too fast for people


[21-Sep-19 04:45 AM] mrlynch#5735
ok


[21-Sep-19 04:45 AM] dukeleto#7326
piratepool.io worker page ruins the privacy for the entire Pirate chain right now


[21-Sep-19 04:45 AM] dukeleto#7326
i have all the zaddrs


[21-Sep-19 04:46 AM] dukeleto#7326
and I will use it in my ARRR search engine


[21-Sep-19 04:46 AM] dukeleto#7326
tell all those people to change their zaddrs whenever the pool removes the page


[21-Sep-19 04:49 AM] mrlynch#5735
back on topic, so unspendable addresses are now not really essential


[21-Sep-19 04:51 AM] jl777c#5810
it doesnt seem to have any benefit, other than making the tx graph larger, so it is useful, but not any direct mitigation


[21-Sep-19 04:59 AM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c i want to ask rudimentary dumb questions


[21-Sep-19 05:00 AM] dukeleto#7326
maybe something useful is all we need in the short term?


[21-Sep-19 05:00 AM] dukeleto#7326
I missed the part that shows why they are not as useful as we thought


[21-Sep-19 05:01 AM] mrlynch#5735
```ARRR will only be vulnerable to dust attacks or you share the chain. Not sure how important is this to privacy :P```
```I made one mistake through, I was only testing one input and one output. (Index was hardcorded), now added to a loop and notice my assumption to mitigate the attack by creating a dust is incorrect.
I can confirm that if you split z-transactions in one dust and one none actual spend does not secure you @jl777c. I was rewriting pieces of zcash and Never took into account uniqueness of the nullifier. Since I was always checking index[0], but I spent index[1] or index[2].```

[21-Sep-19 05:09 AM] dukeleto#7326
It's unclear if duplicate addresses give unique nullifiers, probably not


[21-Sep-19 05:09 AM] dukeleto#7326
that has implications y'all can figure out


[21-Sep-19 05:11 AM] dukeleto#7326
@mrlynch @ca333 i am backing away from this, it's too much to coordinate Pirate + Hush + ITM attack stuff


[21-Sep-19 05:11 AM] dukeleto#7326
Pirate can do what it thinks is best


[21-Sep-19 05:14 AM] mrlynch#5735
each commitment has its' own nullifier


[21-Sep-19 05:16 AM] dukeleto#7326
but does every output get it's own commitment even if it's the same address?


[21-Sep-19 05:16 AM] dukeleto#7326
i am too angry to go look


[21-Sep-19 05:17 AM] mrlynch#5735
each note has a commitment and a nullifier, so yes


[21-Sep-19 05:17 AM] dukeleto#7326
It's way easier for me to just wait for Pirate, I guess. why am I doing free work?


[21-Sep-19 05:17 AM] dukeleto#7326
fucking dummy I am


[23-Sep-19 09:59 PM] Alright#0419
has a POC for deanoymizing txes been created yet?


[23-Sep-19 10:00 PM] Alright#0419
joker and I posted up at a hotel for a day, could take a crack at it if no one has made it yet


[24-Sep-19 12:01 AM] jl777c#5810
go for it, would be good to see how easy it is to do
