From what I am hearing about the QFS, its nodes will be (are!) very powerful, Quantum systems.  This means that these computers already exist and are operating.  What comfort can the community be given that the Komodo blockchain will be secure from hacking by these incredible machines?


[05-Oct-20 11:50 AM] sakata#4279
How can we get more pairs on AtomicDEX? Will there be an API, or will it be based upon submissions? ($XMR & $ERG is a must! Along with other BPSAA projects)


[05-Oct-20 12:29 PM] cascrypto#8206
How is the Komodo team spirit holding up with the pressure off delivering sensible projects and declining interest, are you guys still having fun? What Code/achievement have you Celebrated last?


[06-Oct-20 12:42 PM] lightspeed393#5403
Could you elaborate more on where the actual liablity lies for the team.The atomicDEX code is freedom of speech, so the software itself isn't the issue. Does the liablity lie more with team members running marketmaker nodes, or the structure of the DEX protocol itself because fees are sent to an address controlled by the team. Then the team uses those fees to pay a % to holders of the asset, etc. I'm sure both could be an issue, but it would be interesting to know and make things easier for people to understand.


[06-Oct-20 04:59 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
100% gets paid out,  but yes, you laid out the general concerns and why we are investigating how to de-risk the situation and maintain the promises james has to asset holders while keeping Komodo a open source community driven project

I guess I'll write some question here too 🤔


[06-Oct-20 10:49 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
regarding entity from ca333, and komodo team.


[06-Oct-20 10:49 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
there are many things I don't know


[06-Oct-20 11:49 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
1. where is ca333's entity registered?
2. is that an organisation? or a private limited company? or a foundation?
3. Out of existing Komodo team members which team members are employed or under contract with ca333's entity? Can we have the names or usernames/handles of these specific Komodo team members?
4. The Komodo team members on the Komodo Platform official website, out of them which are part of ca333's entity/company, how they get paid?
5. Does these employed members of this entity get paid from the funds raised in the ICO?
6. If any and if ever, how much funds from the Komodo ICO been paid to these employees in this entity?

I never bothered to asked these questions ever since I joined Komodo team, because my direct payments/dealings been with @jl777c himself. Even til today, if I need to get paid, I only ask him, and nobody else. So, I just always assumed either he's paid me from his own pocket or may be from some ICO funds etc.

In the past I have personally helped in same ways to SuperNET by paying some freelancers from my own personal Visa card for working/doing some work for SuperNET for few week(s)/month(s). I totally understand the need of legal entity which can help with hiring, and payment of the resources and services in legal name, so that internationally hired skilled workers can legally deal with these earnings.

I might ask further questions based on the answers I get of these.

> Yea got to admit this reads like it is avoiding some of the hotter topics in the past couple of days.

Yes, it is – we discussed the questions regarding the regulation situation on the call but didn't want to include the discussion in the post. Whatever we publish on a blog post will be looked at with a magnifying glass, so we want to be careful about what we say. 

As said on the call and Discord before: we are unsure about the entire situation ourselves and trying to understand what this all means. We are preparing to release more info at the very moment.

The questions from Satinder can be clarified when the legal situation and plan gets shorted out.

```AtomicDEX is and remains a non-custodial decentralized exchange solution; however, its protocol process could be viewed as acting as a facilitator service enabling users to find and trade with others in an unregulated fashion. 

Although there is no central server connecting the actual trading partners, services, and nodes that handle trades require compliance. The exchange system, platform, or whichever party supports these activities is legally liable.

What types of legal issues with running a node? Also, isn't localbitcoins site acting as a facilitator?

True story, a few years ago, the largest cannabis concentrate company in california was operating in Santa Rosa. They had a few million dollar extraction machines that needed 100lbs of material to run through and make your concentrates(hash oil). Legalization was right around the corner. There were no laws written about making concentrates, what they were doing was multiple felonies. They invited state regulators to come and see their operation. The politicians toured it, the next day the police came and confiscated all their equipment, and concentrates, etc. No one got arrested. About 9 months later it all got returned.

```2. Is AtomicDEX going to have KYC/AML integration? 

Yes, the version that the official Komodo development team is providing will include KYC/AML compliance. How this gets implemented is yet to be determined and will be decided based on best practices as advised through regulatory and legal compliance counsel. 

The protocol and AtomicDEX project, like all of Komodo, will remain open source technology.  ``` When is our DEX buyout then since you will be taking it KYC which is not what MoMoM is for.


[09-Oct-20 12:23 PM] daemonfox#6136
Cuz non custodial means no dividends to anyone... maybe the Official Komodo Dev team needs to buy up all the DEX instead of split and run and use that to fund the project going forward.


[09-Oct-20 12:24 PM] daemonfox#6136
Its perfectly legal if the DEX Company  itself is paying itself in fees, just not unnamed token holders


[09-Oct-20 12:28 PM] daemonfox#6136
In fact, I posit if you DONT do that and pursue legal legitimacy, having a record of NOT taking care of the original backers might even prevent you from getting any compliance sign offs for committing the exact crimes regulation is accusing all of DEX worldwide for now

@Deleted User  I know it’s implied but it shows vulnerability to the state, and that doesn’t say much for the decentralized nature of the “dex” if this is such a worry to take preemptive measures. Maybe take the dex part out of the name? Nobody will ever be able to convince me that kyc or geoblocking is in any way decentralized. Stop the double speak.

And when you do implement the kyc and geoblocking and the liquidity goes down, then what? Nobody that left is coming back regardless if those restrictions get implemented or removed. Just talking about implementing it has got most people thinking of an exit strategy. A lot of podcasters in the space “ken bosak, Rice crypto, Seth Estrada” were all recently showing love for the AtomicDEX then this kyc/geoblocking shit comes out and all that goes away because I can tell you that everyone that could have been (and was) an ally in promoting the Atomic”DEX” are 100% against this and those bridges will be burnt. There will be no turning back once you give an inch.

I think they have no choice but to give every indication that they will operate in full compliance with EU regs. there is no mobile app without it.


[10-Oct-20 07:42 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
I think marketmaker is backend liquid provider that can be accessed through many front ends - open source projects should still be able to access -IMO...it seems like a technical situation where you have a non compluant UI that accesses a "non compiant" liquidity pool....I guess there may be more to this..


[10-Oct-20 08:02 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
Adex is just a ui needing compliance - apple users will probably not see a non compiant UI unless a jailbroken device accesses it

@Tylor zkFS yeah, it would probably be a web-based solution for ios.

Right....hopefully we can get someone to get more wasm coded for the new tech being tested - nSPV, subatomic, dexp2p.... once that is done...the sky is limitless

@WnyCrypto and so ? Things change. Plans change. I appreciate the fact that Komodo is aware that in a not so distant future regulation will break down most of project that are still dreaming about 100% decentralization.  I can't say that I enjoy geo-blocking, but I definitively won't enjoy to know that Komodo devs team are under warrant.

@az 
No, I criticize the unhonest speech.
They should just end & cut the connection to atomicdex if this brings them into trouble.
As far as I know its open source, so they could better say: "Because of regulations we are forced to implement KYC, but because it goes against our core values to collect your private information, we decided that will not continue the development of atomicdex. But the code is open source, everyone can use and improve it, in its own responsibility"
That would motivate developers, to continue the development of this code.
This devs can work on the source code, without disclosing its identity.

Uniswap has a legal team. The guy is based in Boston. Uniswap probably does more volume in a minute than adex does in a day. I think this is just beginning. if you read the various proposals from the eu, sec, fbi, etc. It's all over the map. but anonymity is the ultimate sin in everyone's eyes. shits fucked and gov wants into your wallet. There is likely a wing of the NSA datacenter dedicated to tracing/doxxing all of the cryptodominion. There are taxpayer funded investigators reading this msg. Some of them are probably even community members and contributors to many projects.

You're right @cipi @az 

This is the kind of stuff we have to address now.  A project can be decentralized and that is not the same thing as being immune from recourse.

[10-Oct-20 01:55 PM] daemonfox#6136
I see one issue still that no one wants to admit... the DEX and MM2 are only decentralized when using the old versions that connect direct to your local full node... everything else is relying on the aDEX reaching back to a handful of hosted servers. The idea left Deactualization the moment it cut out this piece. Where did that go?


[10-Oct-20 02:01 PM] cipi#4502
you don't need "old" version, i run mm2 nodes (AtomicDEX-API) that use native wallets running on the same server


[10-Oct-20 02:03 PM] daemonfox#6136
Previously you could do that without extra in between... you just told the DEX UI to use local and it worked.


[10-Oct-20 02:04 PM] lightspeed393#5403
@daemonfox I opened this feature request for atomicdex-desktop to use native wallets: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/issues/465


[10-Oct-20 02:04 PM] cipi#4502
there is no "in between"... there is actually less "in between" when using AtomicDEX-API then if using GUI, since GUI does actually connect to AtomicDEX-API and does the calls that you can also do manually from CLI


[10-Oct-20 02:06 PM] daemonfox#6136
Is it a single button click?


[10-Oct-20 02:06 PM] cipi#4502
wouldn't be a problem to make GUI use native wallets, all infos needed are already in the config file of the GUI, just need to replace the `electrum` calls with `enable`calls... but requires the wallet to run and the address be imported beforehand

[10-Oct-20 02:07 PM] daemonfox#6136
and now it will stay out for these new KYC reassons


[10-Oct-20 02:07 PM] daemonfox#6136
aDEX will not be able to do this going forward with regulation.


[10-Oct-20 02:09 PM] cipi#4502
has nothing to do with KYC... native mode was not added to GUI because it requires more work from the user... as i said address needs to be imported... if there are already txs on this address, they will only be visible if rescan is done (requires up to hours)... all this would raise a lot of support questions/issues


[10-Oct-20 02:11 PM] lightspeed393#5403
yes exactly its just not as user friendly. Starting the project with just electrum was definitely the smart approach for sake of getting it going and working easily. I just think it would be a cool addition at some point. Maybe a setting you'd have to enable to allow it so that regular users are defaulted to electrum.


[10-Oct-20 02:12 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
It’s definitely doable, as BarterDEX could run full node.  Just low priority , as overwhelming majority of users don’t run full nodes

[10-Oct-20 02:15 PM] cipi#4502
yes, and BarterDEX had some difficulties when using electrums as a maker... so native mode was much more needed back in the "old days" :-)
but AtomicDEX doesn't has this difficulties any more

I pushed for spv in early days of barterdex because of mobility  - (coinomi) spent way to much $$ trying to compile mm1 to Android asked jl777 why we needed spv servers and why txs couldn't be proven  with regular nodes? MM2 is now mobile capable and nSPV was invented by the super genious.... nSPV needs translated to go/rust/wasm from C - electrumX servers go bye bye


[10-Oct-20 04:24 PM] cipi#4502
problem is that nSPV works only on KMD and assetchains, it is not in BTC core, or LTC

The SPV that loads the headers shouldn't the that bad for BTC types 🤔
If really want to mesh the nSPV and SPV which works with headers download for lite wallets


[10-Oct-20 05:02 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
But agree these play some levels of blockers coz ElectumX is more adopted and popular than headers downloading SPV solutions


[10-Oct-20 05:02 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
So an option can be there of such types


[10-Oct-20 05:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Chose between, full native node, SPV, nSPV if supported etc


[10-Oct-20 05:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
For ETH I see it's native node takes a bit time to to sync, but to my little experience with it, once it synced it was good to use...

I have zero idea how ETH smart addresses are created or if they can use a time lock "p2sh" type thing....ill guess a smart contract  would suit..... just was saying it "may" be possible to lock the funds and make asset chains for the top 200 coins in order to eliminate electrumX servers 8n totality  ... I was just saying anything seems possible  with p2sh,nspv,dexp2p, and hopefully i can get people on board with my 'ztomix' and 'Stake and Shake' concepts

If more of the community knew how to run infrastructure like nodes, spv servers, marketmaker from cli it would speak volumes to the cries for decentralization instead of pointing to the kmd team and screaming "regulations wtf?"

Learn to use the tech, ask questions to learn, then make informed decisions based on your own experience and jurisdiction

I got a lot of help in blockchain fundamentals here. Many of the people that come here end up being devs or NN's. The implications of some gov oversight, if administered judiciously, hopefully wont hinder the atmosphere of innovation that has been created. I dont think verus could be viable in any other ecosystem. perhaps we just evolve into new entities. The tech created here will not go away. In any case, I'm not selling shit.

In Turkey we are not forced to add the restrictions that will need to be added by the Komodo team and would be happy to host a version of atomicDEX desktop in our repo. 

As you know, MCL on Marmara Chain is designed to run in real economy. We have so many projects that we will share with you. I believe this Version will easily make AtomicDex desktop a perfect DeFi system with dApps to run in real economy. We have two official offices now in İstanbul, one in Technopark İstanbul, the greatest Technopark in Turkey, and the second nearby businesses and several universities. We are ready to help with my team.

Can you elaborate on the decision to setup the utxo company in germany? I remember reading something about ca333 that he was a traveler (nomad?) that wasn't beholden to any one jurisdiction, why then setup this company in what is arguably one of the most regulated areas of the planet?

```Atomicdex and Komodo should not be conflated

It doesn’t use the chain

Atomicdex existed before Komodo ever did.  It is not the same just because there is overlap of people working on the projects``` @polycryptoblog  can you please elaborate on this statement? Will komodo still gain any advantages from ADEX, such as the reduced maker fee for kmd pair? Other advantages were due to game theory, kmd was set to be main trading pair (if adex brand is distanced from Komodo is this still a goal); and revs was going to pay out in kmd, which would have added buy support (is this  still planned)

[14-Oct-20 07:22 AM] gcharang#6833
the non custodial nature of the dex hasn't changed. the seed words generate priv keys and those can be used to access the coins on any of the supported blockchains. verus desktop wallet supports using the seed words directly

@༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻  A lot of the details are still being worked out.   Kmd should receive some benefits,  to what extent is still being determined.  Re: adex revstream,  it’s still being worked out how it’s going to work,  but *wouldn’t* be solely utxo revstream.  Re: already generating revenue — custom work on top of kmd tech,   Can’t say much at this time,  will be announced end of year early next.  Re: kyc/aml -  still figuring out how the best to implement,  but the only certain is that we won’t be the ones collecting that data,  it won’t be active in the sense I described at end of the month just the general plan going forward.   Re: coins on Adex — adex as a wallet is restriction free,  it’s the DEX part that may have restrictions,  so withdrawing or continuing to use the wallet won’t be an issue.   Re: company location ,  several community members have businesses in different jurisdictions.   It just happened to be that the EU one is where the app was released through.  Prior to this FATF stuff, EU wasn’t that bad towards cryptos

```
a seed node is like an mm2 node, just started with \"i_am_seed\":true
other nodes that want to join need to use \"seednodes\":[\"1.2.3.4\",\"1.2.3.5\"] as start param using the IPs of the seed nodes

Are you in a paid position  @polycryptoblog  or @gcharang ? Or @Audo  I know there has been talk about community building, my questions are along those lines, I'm trying to understand the structure of people here. Such as utxo is the company of devs building an app, that  was more or less synonymous with komodo brand, however that seems to be changing. In a way this is all good as it has been exceedingly difficult to describe the komodo platform and these dividing lines help add clarity as to what komodo platform is, and is about.


[14-Oct-20 10:52 AM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
The link of mm2 to komodo has always been a little murky, but with utxo being their own entity, other than nostalgia towards the brand, it doesn't appear there is any reason to link to kmd


[14-Oct-20 10:57 AM] Audo#5667
@༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻ Generally speaking, these people are part of the team and in paid position:
 - Senior team members
 - Development Team
 - Administration & Support Team
 - Marketing & Business Team
(https://komodoplatform.com/about-komodo/)

Komodo Team = AtomicDEX Team = SuperNET Team – we are the same people

I don't know exactly how this is from legal perspective ad it's been more "decentralized" in the past. To me that doesn't matter, I have always seen that we are all in the same team in either case, and there is no separatation. In future everyone will be working under the same legal setup, and that is what is being figured out.

I hope this brings clarity and answers that you are looking for. We will share more details about everything once we know more.

I guess I am a little confused by this statement from poly ```Atomicdex and Komodo should not be conflated

It doesn’t use the chain

Atomicdex existed before Komodo ever did.  It is not the same just because there is overlap of people working on the projects```ok, I will be done asking questions for awhile. (Other than wondering if there is a guide for setting up a  forked community dex that uses mm2).  I will just wait for this next round of  announcement about these topics.


[14-Oct-20 11:34 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Think of it how like Automattic runs Wordpress.com hosting,  it’s an service by an independent company but focused around a single platform technology .  That company’s members have overlap with the OSS Wordpress community and have contributed back to the codebase they utilize even though they don’t own it.  Komodo will remain an OSS community.   Utxo is part of the komodo community ,  not komodo is part of utxo


[14-Oct-20 11:48 AM] Audo#5667
I also want to clarify that I am looking to build a new team page and include the community

We are looking to blur the lines between the team and the community and list more community contributors on the team page.

We already have a technical solution for that, which is Komodo SSO, which will allow anyone to create a "Komodo profile" that will be showcased on our website if certain conditions are met.

We will have community budget for various things going forward.

As I said last month we are looking to start a new chapter in Komodo and go back to our community roots. Don't let this recent KYC storm misslead you into thinking this wouldn't be the case. The KYC/legal stuff is just something we have to think about and take care of one way or another.

We want to be a strong community project and I am willing to listen to any ideas and feedback and understand how we can move towards that direction. It will just take some time as there's a lot to do. You guys should see progress during Q4.

What happened between hush and kmd team? Why is dukeleto a scammer?


[15-Oct-20 05:41 AM] jl777c#5810
technically he understands that atomicDEX adding KYC (in. the future). in now way affects PIRATE. yet he kept attacking. PIRATE saying that it. has KYC. this is an unacceptable misrepresentation and since he understands the tech,  it is intentional. all so he can pump his HUSH price


[15-Oct-20 05:41 AM] jl777c#5810
basically anybody that lies to pump the coin price...


[15-Oct-20 05:43 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612

he is constantly attacking zcash

then. he went crazy about vrsc

now he is saying all sorts of nonsense about kmd and pirate


[15-Oct-20 05:46 AM] jl777c#5810
crypto is hard enough without having such nonsense, so we are all better off without hush in the ecosystem.

Although I'm not a psychiatrist, I have to agree with some of the diagnosis other people made about his state of mind.


[15-Oct-20 05:46 AM] jl777c#5810
hush copied pirate to be z->z only, and since pirate is 2 years ahead of this,  he has to say all sorts of bad things about pirate? not sure


[15-Oct-20 05:47 AM] jl777c#5810

clearly he has some problems, or pretends to have them, but that doesnt mean people should trust their money with such a person. and most in the project all just repeat what he was saying

@here Townhall in 1 hour. Do you guys have any questions?

> Q: Why redfox change to verus and erc20?
We can't really answer questions about independent projects and their plans. Best is to ask directly from them to get the right answers. But, I believe they will co-exist in multiple platforms.

> _Questions about current legal setup_
We have been dropping answers here and elsewhere saying that we will clarify everything once we have everything finalized. If there are specific questions they can be asked on the Townhall's free discussion/quoestions segment

> When will it be possible to test Pangea pokergame?
If we have Pangea community/team on the call we can have this as a discussion item during the free conversation segment

> Questions about recent Hush situation
Seems like this question has been answered here already and it's better to not focus on external drama, but to talk about Komodo. Anyone is free to bring it up in the free discussion segment if there's something more we have to clarify or there are some concerns.

**Questions So Far**

> When will chips be tradeable on mobile version on dex? 

> When will be the stress test for adex v 0.3.0?

> You guys have mentioned that anyone can fork adex. What network infrastructure would be required to run a community version of the dex? Electrum servers and?

I would like to hear about what Komodo means for you, and what you see as our core purpose and mission. 

Example, @NutellaLicka  shared his thoughts on #💬┃general 
> I guess the thing I've come around to is that atomicdex isn't komodo. It is a dapp created by devs that are also komodo devs. Those devs can create whatever they want to create.
> 
> Komodo isnt just the people in this discord with the "team" role. Komodo is an idea. Komodo is every person that chooses to take their financial freedom into their own hands. Komodo is the devs who create their own products on top of the komodo base code. Komodo is the users that chose to engage in constructive dialogue on what features and products they'd like to see built and would use in the future. Komodo is the person who knows nothing about blockchain but can launch their own chain with the help from the community within a few hours. 
> 
> Komodo is a decentralised platform that isnt dictated or run by a company, any group of people, or a single project. So I'd say to people, if you don't like what is being built, then do one of three things:
> 1. Express your opinion in a constructive way that would possibly change the course of development.
> 2. Decide to do nothing and withhold your right to complain.
> Or
> 3. Take the initiative and start building your own projects/products. If you aren't a developer, find like minded people in the kmd community to assist you. Build together as a team, or discuss your thoughts in an open forum to generate interest in your ideas.

I don't have comment on this atm because I don't have enough information on how it's implementation. What I can say though is that as any Komodo ecosystem project has grown it trends to impact all of them.  So in this sense as Verus furthers it's projects it's going to help all of us.

We're probably going to be doing some joint announcement coverage as we get more information coming out.  The liquidity pools are still pretty new and getting spun up on Verus, as a result that means options are getting explored and I know i"m looking forward to doing co coverage and what Komodo Team is working to do implementations with

@Deleted User 
There's more announcements to come over DEX assets and revenue sharing assets.  We don't have the information right now, what I can tell you is that it's been made clear by JL777 that those involved in those assets are not going to be abandoned.  What their future looks like as far as implementation is unclear, and being aggressively explored.

@suhthern-girl 
We actually commented on this in last weeks townhall if you'd like to refer to the notes.

If you want a quick recap Komodo has a module implementation built specifically to address quantum attack.  It is ready and can be implemented to anywhere in Komodo ecosystem.

I have a question: you play with chips on pokertable right? How you buy chips? Only with komodo or also with other coins? The best strategy is to buy chips only with kmd....than there will be a big demand  for kmd....i hope this is the plan from kmd and pangea team?

Or if more coins planned than it would be fine when you get a discount if you buy with kmd

how about this: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/715 ?
paying the dexfees on AtomicDEX with KMD will benefit both KMD and the users, since they can avoid paying dexfees with high fee coins like BTC and ETH/ERC20
drawback is that users will need KMD to trade... could make it configurable

I think your point about `coins that are now dead or that moved to a new chain` is almost just as important as avoiding high fees on other chains.

KMD would then benefit from all AtomicDEX versions, cloned ones, non-KYC ones, whatever the future will bring

With crypto becoming more mainstream and adopted by more and more businesses, how does komodo is planning to profile itself here?
I mean, can we see Komodo like what linux did for server applications for example? Becoming mainstream as blockchain provider for businesses?
How does Komodo plan to convince/get the attention of executive people with low/zero technical knowledge on blockchain?

I think this angle was attacked with an aws partnership and the antara framework. Maybe the market isn't ready yet or whatever but I don't think that it has really taken off as a strategy yet.

new EU regs, and presumably future regs from america

not needing to based on current regs


[21-Oct-20 01:44 PM] jl777c#5810
but the new EU regs are very broad


[21-Oct-20 01:45 PM] jl777c#5810
and it isnt just offering leveraged trading that is being regulated


[21-Oct-20 01:45 PM] jl777c#5810
bitmex was. afoul of already existing regulations


[21-Oct-20 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
what this means is that there will be different. atomicDEX networks, each conforming to regulations in. various jurisdictions and users can select which one they want to trade in


[21-Oct-20 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
atomicDEX team is based in EU, so following EU regs is needed, at least for the default setting. if the user. is in a different jurisdiction, they can override it


[21-Oct-20 01:48 PM] jl777c#5810
think of it like customizing it to a different language,  this is just customizing it to a different set of rules

@jl777c That is a good approach.  Also, some people -- as a for instance -- are Americans without being U.S. (Corporation) citizens.  They are outside of U.S. jurisdiction.  There should be an atomicDEX network for them, too.

@Audo I believe you should rewrite that specially for smartchains. If a smartchain using kmd tech wants to 
implement kyc aml they can do that. I kind of understand what the message should be but 'won't ever' is a strong word if you are not 100% in control.

Good idea we can change it to 
No, there won't ever be any KYC/AML implementation for the KMD coin and Komodo team will not enforce a KYC/AML for chains made using Komodo tech.


[21-Oct-20 11:07 PM] Audo#5667
good point, we can't enforce KYC/AML to other projects/chains since they are independent

Yea I'm really appreciating all the great questions.  Any project has such a wealth of information that half the challenge for transparency knowing what to share that's important to the community, and the other half is having people that are completely open with sharing including saying 'we don't know and we're exploring it.'

We've got the second half here, community members coming and asking questions helps gives us the first half.   Ty to those asking questions and being engaged to help exercise the open source project strengths here.

[27-Oct-20 02:08 PM] sakata#4279
Why BandChain? Why not utilise resources that are closer to us over at the BPSAA, such as Oracle Pools at Ergo. 

This ties in with Ether-1, a decentralised web hosting service. A community contributor mentioned during the community-structuring discussion that every project should have a domain allocated to them, which can be used to showcase their work and would also have collateral enhancement for Komodo's image.

So, was BandChain an authentic decision, or a marketing one?


[27-Oct-20 08:01 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
The integration with Band protocol was in the works before Komodo joined the BPSAA.   We are not restricted to one oracle provider, so Ergo could be an option in the future.  Work is being done on Cosmos compatibility this will lend aid to that

Some time ago there was an Interview with binance ceo changpeng zhao where he claim that kmd is a good project for future. So the ceo of the eorld biggest exchange know kmd and have a good opinion about it.

My question is: was there a contact to him to cooperate? As i know binance also want to create a dex...we have a real dex...so why not work together and binance use our dex ...for me its the best chance because cz know us and our product

@polycryptoblog  sorry but thats a joke? Band protocol and all other partnerships (redfox,verus...) are no start ups?

When does a company/organization/community stop being a startup in your mind?


[28-Oct-20 01:32 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠 when they generate enough revenue to sustain and grow and have profit  @Deleted User  more referring to projects who are seeking fundraising and/or have little to no development completed


[28-Oct-20 01:33 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Komodo is at/almost at that point


[28-Oct-20 01:33 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
By that definition Verus will always stay a start-up, since it's a non-profit goal.

nonprofits still need to make profit

will need more devs, and other costs will come up. and no doubt funds should be put aside for rainy day


[28-Oct-20 01:36 AM] Mylo#8306
depends what "equity and/or resources" comes along for the ride.
in verus' case, mike & son provided a lot of tech to not require the hand-holding/support that the kmd team is using as a ranking-factor/filter


[28-Oct-20 01:38 AM] Mylo#8306
> Avoiding startups if possible

avoiding _self bootstrapping resource hungry_ startups if possible
well funded startups will have (money) resources to hire devs with skills to build out.


[28-Oct-20 01:40 AM] Mylo#8306
looking into #💎｜blur the goal of the project is to integrate a monero fork with dpow extending the reach of dpow.
the resources provided by team-blur is tech power to do the monero side of things.  the resource cost for kmd to reward ratio for extending dpow to a new family, is a good fit.


[28-Oct-20 01:41 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
biz is also doing the coding


[28-Oct-20 01:41 AM] polycryptoblog#1173

exactly.  all the tech resources with a "hell yes" attitude to collaborate.

As I know, Binance already has their Binance dex and for now their support project Thorchain will be alternative. Our AtomicDEX should find another way to grow and develop.

that would be a good usecase for a token on Komodo


[28-Oct-20 08:36 PM] Mylo#8306
any 3rd party that builds on top of mm2 could apply this - when there was the 10% of the dexfee going to the gui dev.  depending how things are progressing with DEX asset, and stuff.  if there was a KMD airdrop for MM coins or tokens on an MM-chain.  many possibilities exist - need a rock-solid business case

What is the Composer?, can this be modified? Is it Open source? Can it be included with the binary.  It seems that it could be a great way to get people over the fear of command line and add an easier to use interface for komodo and asset chains. Features such as building chains, executing CC, executing smart chain api, fixing forked chains, messed up wallets, bootstraps, etc would be easier


[29-Oct-20 05:54 AM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
There has been talk about trying to cultivate junior developers, has there been any talk about creating a Komodo academy or just
Online classes you sign up for that is taught by someone. Would cost money and could be a great way for a knowlegeded developer or community member to make some extra cash. Maybe once or twice a year such a class could be offered. I'm thinking this would be more of an independent optional thing for developers not something for over worked people to stress on. But maybe someone has an extra hour a week to stream a class.

Possible Class syllabus's
Komodo learning path, Build a dex class, project development: Easy dev finder type of guide to taking an idea to completion with tips on where to hire programmers etc, maybe even a  Jl777 masterclass: programming CC.

[29-Oct-20 06:09 AM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
For lack of a better term, I am hoping the community can create a Komodo recipe book. The CC are amazing and quite powerful, I am hoping we can start a discussion thread that highlights these for the purpose of building a list that showcases what can be built. Such as the combination of these 2-3 CC you can make this, or if these two CC are used this can be built.  Example: TokenCC + Oracles = Tokens with linked data


[29-Oct-20 06:19 AM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
And finally, custom ERC tokens can be added to AtomicDex, can we also add custom komodo smartchains to AtomicDex? That's about all, peace out.✌️

@Sudoba 
Not sure what you mean by this, can you clarify?

the link shared in the chat for people to upvote and comment


[05-Nov-20 07:13 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Should make it a lot easier for them to know what articles to upvote and comment on


[05-Nov-20 07:15 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
With upvoting, doesnt even have to be komodo specific community


[05-Nov-20 07:15 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I know a lot of bounty hunters who are looking for projects to affiliate with / get bounties


[05-Nov-20 07:16 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Just having the bounty out may get some new community members joining in


[05-Nov-20 07:16 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
coming for bounties only, but staying once they see what komodo has to offer


[05-Nov-20 07:18 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
In my own opinion id say make a short post saying that you are looking for
1) people who are looking for bounties
2) people who have  enough karma (finding 1 or 2 should be enough)

Build up the numbers and focus only on that until ready, so once we have people who are beginning to post across reddit, the links can be shared and we can get the campaign going without any delay

[05-Nov-20 07:20 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Also not sure if i heard it right, but with the cross project bounty


[05-Nov-20 07:20 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Offer free listing / discount listing for other projects


[05-Nov-20 07:21 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
in return, they put up their own funds for trading contest


[05-Nov-20 07:21 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
between their pair on atomicdex


[05-Nov-20 07:33 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
-----------
Also if atomicdefi is to be an all in one suit, may be if possible to reach out to other projects, to try and reach out to as many other projects to integrate their app / dex / liquidity pool / components into atomicdefi suite itself


[05-Nov-20 07:33 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Ie waves dex, if theres a way to just plug their dex into the atomicdefi gui


[05-Nov-20 07:33 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
so its really sort of an all in one suite for any crypto project dapp to be implemented into


[05-Nov-20 07:51 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
-----
and also a rebump on my original idea, I still think it would somehow work out if some of the smaller issues were solved and it was looked at as an alternative rather than a solution to the liquidity.
If there could be a "liquidity mode" on adex, solely for long term holders looking to buy @ market price, but dont have access to binance or their exchange for whatever reason.
Even if its more centralized and not exactly a peer to peer swap


[05-Nov-20 07:52 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Explicitly state that any traded funds are non withdrawable for 1 day


[05-Nov-20 07:52 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
And just have people put up orders on "liquidity mode" @ .5% above binance or whatever exchange api


[05-Nov-20 07:52 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
and instead of atomic swapping it directly, person a locks funds, person b buys and sends to atomicdex


[05-Nov-20 07:52 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
and person a gets coin, person b gets profit

Would work sort of like uber

Person a puts buy order up // 1btc of kmd 
person b/c/d/e/f can click accept order and have 1 hour to fill the order

person b/c/d/e/f would have 1btc on binance already, for this purpose.
They have x amount of time to send the coin into specified address
If not, then the are down rated. They just buy and send to make the slight % profit

Works other way by having people who have orders up for sell already, and when a taker wants the order, they have x amount of time to fill it

Could be a seperate app in the atomicdefi app if it doesnt seem to fill the target of atomicdex, would bring in a lot of people who cant access binance imo


[05-Nov-20 07:53 AM] Audo#5667
👍


[05-Nov-20 07:53 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
more so to provide more utility to the dex and for people who dont care about the whole trading / speed


[05-Nov-20 07:53 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
if i cant access binance, but can access a non kyc version of atomicdex


[05-Nov-20 07:53 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I would use it that way myself


[05-Nov-20 07:56 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
----------
I feel asking for social media influencer will get less numbers than asking for say bounty hunters, or people who can upvote for kmd


[05-Nov-20 07:56 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
community seeing "looking for social media inflencer and awareness spreading" might seem too professional or too much effort

@Crabby Paddy prob less numbers, but higher efficacy and more able to manage accountability issues.

duke wants to kill every project he has ever been associated with, just look at his twitter, does that look like the twitter of a person with a sound mind?


[09-Nov-20 12:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
he delisted from the only active exchange hush was on, he wants to remove 51% attack protection, it would take $8 to 51% attack hush after, im sure if he pisses enough people off he will have that. he is the only one driving away the hush community

@Deleted User doesn't it look like a person who quit projects because he did not agree with the philosofy and code ??just saying


[09-Nov-20 12:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
he was not part of the KMD project?

If he leaves a project that's no issue, but he'll be slinging mud till the end of days.

What is the total USD value of the public 137k atomic swaps? We can see the rolling 24hr figure but would be nice to see the total value. I know some of the coins don't have a price (test coins & such)


[26-Nov-20 04:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
How many testers would be optimal for a good result ??? How many do you expecting?

In the region of 50m usd i might be able to get a better number if I import historic prices

Is there a list of questions to be discussed (prior to Townhall) that’s publicly available? If not, it would be kind of cool to see ahead of time, like an agenda.


[30-Dec-20 02:39 AM] Audo#5667
@tolken and everyone, please leave questions here and we will answer them.

The basic agenda of each Townhall is to run through the news & updates of the past 7 days and then answer all the questions that were submitted here.

Something was tweeted and then taken down. I don't want to comment on it because there is no announcement nor details. If and when there's a partnership of any kind you will hear about it from our official blog and it will be co-announced with the other party.

I think such partnership will never happened...only partnerships with no name projects that doesnt helped kmd to grow (k64, monaize,hush,...)

We have partnership ANNC's for 2021 - and partnerships != KMD price action growth as a guarantee, but they do = Komodo growth.


[30-Dec-20 06:51 PM] Jcharming#2693
Good idea ☝


[30-Dec-20 11:49 PM] nonsense#5272
Kmd team also guarantee years/month ago that kmd will benefit more than other altcoins in next altcoin bullrun....and now we all know that it was a lie and  that kmd dump so hard...reach every week a new all time low


[31-Dec-20 12:19 AM] Jcharming#2693
Komodo team isn't in the business of making promises or 'guarantees' on price action - we're tech focused here.  KMD is our community currency here.  Go watch the AtomicDEX Stress Test stream and you'll see how we're looking to expand use cases for KMD community currency this year - atomicdex.io/stresstest 

You have no need to come here to fud an OG project - if you're not interested then move along no hard feelings, there's many of us working here to produce something great that lasts longer than 3 months and ends in a rugpull.


[31-Dec-20 01:13 AM] nonsense#5272
For investors you produce only rubbish...from ico 12.000 sats to now 1.750 sats looks not to "something great that lasts longer than 3 months and ends in a rugpull"


[31-Dec-20 01:17 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
> from ico 12.000 sats to now 1.750 sats
yeah, that's only 7x in 4 years!


[31-Dec-20 01:21 AM] nonsense#5272
So kmd produce something great within 4 years what is worth 1/7  of what it was at the beginning.

Great 🥳


[31-Dec-20 01:22 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
0.00012000 * 600
0.072
vs
 0.00001750 * 28813.59

that's 7/1, not 1/7


[31-Dec-20 01:25 AM] nonsense#5272
Ico price was btc...not usd...so if you give kmd team 1btc at ico which is now worth 0,2 btc there is no lose? Mhhh...maybe you live in another mathematic world


[31-Dec-20 01:26 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
for every $1k invested in ICO, the investor now has a value of $7k
because math


[31-Dec-20 01:26 AM] nonsense#5272
The benchmark is btc because you change btc versus kmd


[31-Dec-20 01:27 AM] nonsense#5272
Ok ok...and how much will value if people stay with bitcoin?


[31-Dec-20 01:27 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
There's plenty of things to be upset about, your lack of understanding value and buying power isn't one of them


[31-Dec-20 01:27 AM] nonsense#5272
The decision of any investor was bet against btc because you think kmd will be better than btc


[31-Dec-20 01:28 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
until the bottom drops out and there are no more suckers to dump the useless BTC on


[31-Dec-20 01:29 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
The decision of any investor should be to understand value and the increase of value
Could one have made more than 7x in profits with some other coin(s)? yes
Does that make KMD a bad investment for ICO investors? no


[31-Dec-20 01:30 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
That you "only" made 7x profit has exactly no one feeling bad for you


[31-Dec-20 01:31 AM] nonsense#5272
why to invest into a coin when  revenue is smaller than currency you have before...it makes no sense...so investment was not 7/1


[31-Dec-20 01:31 AM] nonsense#5272
My currency befire was btc


[31-Dec-20 01:31 AM] nonsense#5272
I get kmd for it


[31-Dec-20 01:32 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
If you invested $1k, you now have $7k in buying power for it (not counting interest)
PS- BTC is **not** a currency


[31-Dec-20 01:32 AM] nonsense#5272
Now 4 years later i wsnt to swap it to btc and get back 0.2 btc
...so you want to tell me that i make profit against btc and it was a good decision  to change btc versus kmd??


[31-Dec-20 01:34 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
ffs, learn what "buying power" means or take your tears down the road; literally no one cares about your inability to understand that you profited from your ICO purchase (least of all folks like me that bought in at $2)


[31-Dec-20 01:36 AM] nonsense#5272
Is 0.2btc more than 1 btc? Yes or no?

on the bright side, your nickname matches your writings


[31-Dec-20 01:46 AM] nonsense#5272
Ok ok...if i take your logic...i spent  809,99$ to get 1 btc...then i decided this 1btc is a good investment to kmd and i spent this 1 btc to get 8333 kmd...now 4 years later i swap it back to btc and get 0,14 btc

So i have now 4.060$
Then i realize that if i dont swap to kmd and stay with btc i had now 29.000$
I also realize that the difference is not on my bank account...its on bank account of kmd team


[31-Dec-20 01:46 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
_goes back to something far more important (like watching MTV or something)_

If the dog hadn't have stopped to take a shit, he might have caught the rabbit


[31-Dec-20 01:50 AM] nonsense#5272
In other words...i give kmd team 29.000 $ to get 4060$ 4 years later ...thats seems to be very fair in your eyes??


[31-Dec-20 01:50 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
That you made a lesser profit still doesn't change the fact that **you made a profit**


[31-Dec-20 01:52 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
> i give kmd teqm 29.000 $ to get 4060$ 
**__NO__** you *traded* the team $810 (I'm guessing this, because you keep saying a different value each minute)


[31-Dec-20 01:54 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
if you traded them $29000, you'd have 414285 KMD worth $207142.86


[31-Dec-20 01:54 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
either way, a profit


[31-Dec-20 01:54 AM] nonsense#5272
We are on the right way...so you say if investor dont invest in kmd he make more profit? ;-)


[31-Dec-20 01:55 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
"more profit" is moot


[31-Dec-20 01:56 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
you made a profit


[31-Dec-20 01:56 AM] nonsense#5272
Maybe but its also true or not?


[31-Dec-20 01:57 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
it's also true that if you cashed out at ATH, you'd have made 24x what you made now


[31-Dec-20 01:57 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
also moot


[31-Dec-20 01:57 AM] nonsense#5272
Thats also true


[31-Dec-20 01:57 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
that you cannot manage your finances to your best gain isn't the team's fault, issue, or problem


[31-Dec-20 01:59 AM] nonsense#5272
But is kmd not a long time project?? They all the time mentioned thats its not a sprint, its a marathon...but if you are look at time chart its looks not very good in longtime...


[31-Dec-20 02:00 AM] nonsense#5272
Thats true but if i cashed out at ath kmd has still the problem that it us now at atl..so still problem for investors....


[31-Dec-20 02:00 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
if you cashed out KMD at the all time high, after buying at ICO, BTC would have to hit $134400 to equal the gain you would have made if you never got into KMD


[31-Dec-20 02:00 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
"ifs" mean nothing


[31-Dec-20 02:01 AM] nonsense#5272
Thats correct...thats why we have to look into the present...here and now


[31-Dec-20 02:01 AM] nonsense#5272
And here and now looks not good


[31-Dec-20 02:01 AM] nonsense#5272
Thats all what i claim


[31-Dec-20 02:02 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
And in the "present...here and now", your invested value is 7x greater than your investment


[31-Dec-20 02:02 AM] nonsense#5272
Thahts also moot


[31-Dec-20 02:02 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
no, it's anything but moot
because, currency and buying power and value


[31-Dec-20 02:03 AM] nonsense#5272
0,14 btc is not 1 btc but we are again at beginning of our discussion so it make no sense


[31-Dec-20 02:03 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
if your claim is that your value is moot then your entire posting is moot, because your entire rant is about value


[31-Dec-20 02:04 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
What fiat is used where you live?


[31-Dec-20 02:05 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
Do you compare that fiat value against what you would have in Congolese francs?


[31-Dec-20 02:07 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
That you don't have 48x in value of BTC is on you
As is the fact that you could have cashed out KMD at KMD's ATH and you'd have 168x in value of BTC


[31-Dec-20 02:07 AM] nonsense#5272
You dont understand the claim...i never claim that against $ there was no win...i claim that investment into kmd with btc was  a big loss because you will now get only 1/7  btc back ...if you say its not correct then you live in another world


[31-Dec-20 02:09 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
I say that it's not correct because you could have double traded and had $100000+


[31-Dec-20 02:09 AM] nonsense#5272
Ok you are right👍


[31-Dec-20 02:10 AM] ComputerGenie#7004

@nonsense you are one of the reasons a lot of members stop dropping by for a chat or catch up 🤦‍♂️ this exact conversation has happened at least 10 times over the past year. 

Yes a lot of people want to value things in sats, but for gods sake look at your fiat value. If you invest $1000 into a project, and a year later it goes to $100,000, then btc flies to a million, would you complain that you “lost” value? 

And you constantly say the btc is now the team and they have benefited. You do realise most btc funds are reserved for notarizations, which is for the whole ecosystem and an integral part of komodo. 

If they had it your way, all the btc would already be gone by now, spent on useless marketing and a project with no funds left for anything. 

You made 7x your fiat. Go cash it out and invest in something else which you think will net you a profit in the short term. 

If you constantly fud, and you keep thinking kmd will drop, why are you still holding? That is called stupidity! 

If you’re still here because you still believe in the core team, the vision and think there is a chance, then don’t complain because you obviously can see the potential in what they are doing. 

Years of constant “price is shit, I lost money” does no good for the community, for the team moral, and for yourself. Stop feeling sorry that you made a “mistake” on a 700% gain, and do something about it. Or just sell and buy bitcoin 🙂


[31-Dec-20 03:02 AM] nonsense#5272
I dont know you but all i know is that team make false  promises

Kmd is diwn so hard against btc...dzring the altnarket abd cryptomarket is raising like hell...kmd team laughing about others projects like waves but waves for example make a nice jump in the last year although kmd claim its shit project...kmd all the time claim the have the best tech and will benefit in next bull run but kmd dump hardwr than before although bull markethaa begun month ago...kmd team also didnt hear to community...you say this conswrvation was before many times?? So there are a lot of dissatisfied investors 

It makes no sense to say that kmd is amazong and we are the best althoug market show absolut no intetest and price dump sincw years....a solution can be a good marketing but also this solution kmd doesnt want.

[31-Dec-20 08:27 AM] Regnar#6164
From Community Panel Channel, that Jcharming is explaining right now:

Can we release a version of AtomicDEX Desktop without the DEX tab? Komodo does not have an official wallet that is available to everyone world wide.

We are geoblocking downloads for our official wallet because it has a DEX tab (can trade). This has led to us pushing 3rd party wallets to hold KMD and having to handle support questions for these wallets that we don't maintain, for example Magnum wallet shut down completely. This also leads us to issues where people are using the AtomicDEX wallet as a wallet, not using the DEX, but they are effectively getting locked out of their wallets because the forced updates blocks them from logging in and they are geographically banned from downloading the update.

Suggestion: Modify AtomicDEX Desktop to remove the DEX tab and not start the MM engine on startup. This effectively makes it just an official Non-Custodial desktop wallet.

Do we have any updates on Antara Composer usage?


[31-Dec-20 08:35 AM] Jcharming#2693
We can say this - 
"If your VPN is pointed to a region that restricts downloads of Fintech & DeFi products because of it's local restrictions - then you should be sure to turn off your VPN or point it to a region that doesn't restrict such applications like AtomicDEX"


[31-Dec-20 08:38 AM] Regnar#6164
Here's my suggestion for AtomicDEX Desktop which I pitched a while back

[31-Dec-20 08:39 AM] Jcharming#2693
@[GiveUlt] Zer0zer @Regnar 
Not attempting to ignore the question - right now Antara has been de-prioritized to give stronger focus on AtomicDEX since Komodo can push it out as a forward facing product.   So we're not talking about it right now because there's nothing new to talk about or add to the conversation atm - keeping the focus on what Komodo is active on. 

The future of Antara looks a lot more like bringing it all under Komodo and creating clear pathings to all the product pieces and CC libraries as well as it's considerations for Komodo 2. 0 - the architecture revamp that was talked about during the end of AtomicDEX stress test Dec 12 & 13


[31-Dec-20 08:39 AM] Regnar#6164
Which would retain a decentralized, non-custodial wallet, and allow us or users to have additional things that could be added/removed based on regional/legal requirements


[31-Dec-20 08:41 AM] Jcharming#2693
If this is a high quality path you want to see I'm really encouraging of members forking AtomicDEX to create these opportunities - you can start this up in the mean time if you're invested in this buddy. Full support.


[31-Dec-20 08:42 AM] Regnar#6164
I agree, forks are good. However the issue for which I originally mentioned was not that there are no options, it was that we are forced to promote 3rd party wallets (forks or not) instead of an official Komodo wallet.


[31-Dec-20 08:43 AM] Regnar#6164
Forking AtomicDEX to remove this, is no better than promoting Magnum, Verus Desktop, Coinomi etc. Komodo still would not have an official wallet for people *that isn't geoblocked*


[31-Dec-20 08:43 AM] [GiveUlt] Zer0zer#4262
hm ok thanks for your answer


[31-Dec-20 08:44 AM] Jcharming#2693
Today right now there is an option - this is the answer we can talk about. 
> We can say this - 
> "If your VPN is pointed to a region that restricts downloads of Fintech & DeFi products because of it's local restrictions - then you should be sure to turn off your VPN or point it to a region that doesn't restrict such applications like AtomicDEX"\


[31-Dec-20 08:46 AM] Regnar#6164
@Jcharming as to what you are saying right now, my bet is they will pressure SPV servers


[31-Dec-20 08:46 AM] Regnar#6164
Pressure there would disable most mobile wallets, most light desktop wallets, most websites


[31-Dec-20 08:46 AM] Regnar#6164
or at least restrict the ability to broadcast transactions


[31-Dec-20 08:48 AM] Regnar#6164
@Jcharming again, this was something I mentioned to you in the community panel, they aren't just going after projects, they are going after projects that tout and promote methods of circumventing regulations and AML programs. So we cannot promote that as official Komodo teams.


[31-Dec-20 08:49 AM] Regnar#6164
BitMEX openly stated people should use VPNs to login, they openly stated they incorporated in areas where they could "bribe regulators with coconuts" and other sorts of things. They were made examples of specificially because of that


[31-Dec-20 08:49 AM] Jcharming#2693
We're not promoting methods of circumnavigating we're educating starting form the assumption that our audience members are in a region that it is not illegal and may be using a VPN to connect to regions that have imposed blocks.


[31-Dec-20 08:50 AM] Jcharming#2693
And yea - BitMEX is going hard against.  I'm they've decided to answer by saying "Yea so what - what can you do"  Going to be interesting to see

Question 7
from Telegram From: usman
"would it be possible to convert dust (tiny amounts of coins) in Atomicdex for KMD - would be a good use for KMD and would increase the use. Binnance allows you to convert tiny amounts for their own Binnance coin. A similar feature would be good for AtomicDex"


[07-Jan-21 08:18 AM] Regnar#6164

isn't that already how it is? do you mean release it without the DEX page entirely?


[07-Jan-21 08:26 AM] Regnar#6164
AtomicDEX downloads is geo blocked for a huge portion of users because it has DEX features. This inadvertently means Komodo does not have an official wallet that isn't geoblocked. So users who want the official wallet, or like the look of AtomicDEX, but don't want the trade features, can't even download it.


[07-Jan-21 08:26 AM] lightspeed393#5403
If you're in a geoblocked country you can still download it and use the wallet features. the DEX tab is just unclickable.


[07-Jan-21 08:26 AM] lightspeed393#5403
or that's how it was a few weeks back


[07-Jan-21 08:27 AM] ComputerGenie#7004

[07-Jan-21 08:48 AM] Jcharming#2693
for kBTC kETH I think so from what I've explored yes this is one of the avenues to make it happen.

> but not under 0.00777... this fixed limit should be removed
yeah, that's what I was on about


[07-Jan-21 08:50 AM] ejuliano#8606
is it possible to remove that fixed limit?


[07-Jan-21 08:51 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
yes, it's a mainly arbitrary number that was set


[07-Jan-21 08:52 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
yes it can be moved but trade might be so small that fees eat it up thats why a min was set


[07-Jan-21 08:52 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
at the time it was a reasonable dust floor
with $35k BTC, not so much


[07-Jan-21 08:52 AM] ejuliano#8606
ah as a "protective" measure


[07-Jan-21 08:53 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
there is a btc proxy in the works for  2021  cant say much but it will be optimized for swaps,  faster blocktimes and lower fees

it is - the conversation about a flood of newbies or people getting trashed by fee's is my best answer for why we're here on this approach, however I have seen and heard conversations that this is on dev team radar as a QoL update and it might be included in the 040 wrap, can't make any clear promises on it though now

flip-side "devil's advocate":
If I'm willing to pay $400 in fees to trade $200, why isn't that my free choice?


[07-Jan-21 08:59 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
because typically in that scenario its unintentional and just is an setup for people to complain about us  because they wont take the responsbility they messed it up


[07-Jan-21 09:00 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
and this is kinda a "real world example"
because of this limit and my need for a specific amount of BTC
I'm forced to use a CEX, pay double gas fees and double BTC fees 😦


[07-Jan-21 09:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I think the kind of feature genie is after is mostly for advanced users who can understand the consiquences of changing the network transactions fee for BTC.


[07-Jan-21 09:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
If there is an option to enable "Advanced Users Mode" etc, and only after that an option is shown to change the transaction fee for these advanced users, it would mean this user is responsible for his/her own actions if the trade failes and the fee amount is lost to netwrok.


[07-Jan-21 09:02 AM] TonyL#3577
It's worth to open GH issues for such proposals/convos, otherwise less chances it'll go outside of this chat / into actual implementation


[07-Jan-21 09:02 AM] Jcharming#2693
This is my fav interp that I've heard of this in talks - the idea that we have an 'advanced' feature set when activated allows users the complete control that is in line with our ethos.  

Maybe it'll just exist as a cmd line

As for nSPV, how big is the bare minimum nSPV download? Cloning the git repo/install is about 75mb but do we have a "lighter" version of it since it's called the "superlite" wallet?


[07-Jan-21 09:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I think for that you'll need a pre-compiled downloads? 🤔


[07-Jan-21 09:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it is only a binary, a single static binary that you need for nspv, if pre-compiled is you are after

it wouldn't be big in size as I see it
you have few tasks to do for chrome extension:
- compile JS bytecode of it using wasmer/wasm/Emscripten etc
- code the ability to start this with different assetchain params as each chain needs triggering each instance of nspv


[07-Jan-21 09:17 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
may be few more


[07-Jan-21 09:18 AM] Regnar#6164
oh mine is a `dumb` extension. It requires nSPV to be installed and running in background. Just a simple iframe to localhost, but I was going to add my own page that was visually optimized for "extension" sized pages

you guys should upload the townhall meetings on LBRY.TV ,  you can sync the youtube channel their so they auto upload I believe, I mainly use Lbry to watch videos and would like to be able to watch the town hall meetings there ,


[08-Jan-21 03:49 PM] BoBot-LunaMaxi#8821
also would be nice to add LBC to the dex since I earn LBC for watching videos would be nice to exchange them on the dex , a lot of youtubers are leaving youtube and heading to Lbry due to censorship , could gain some users to the dex


[08-Jan-21 03:52 PM] BoBot-LunaMaxi#8821
also the KMD team would earn LBC from posting their videos


[08-Jan-21 03:54 PM] ejuliano#8606
Nice @BoBot-LunaMaxi 
I envision a nice future for DEXs... the usecase for DEX and how it will be much popular as people earn tokens/coins for example such as LBC for using LBRY, and then use the DEX to swap it for more liquid or popular coin


[08-Jan-21 03:57 PM] BoBot-LunaMaxi#8821
yes, would be an easy way to onboard new users


[08-Jan-21 03:59 PM] ejuliano#8606
when token/coin creation so easy everyone's doing it like creating new email address, DEX will be highly sought exchange in order to transform the value - from one token/coin to another


[08-Jan-21 04:00 PM] BoBot-LunaMaxi#8821
what would it take to get LBC listed?


[08-Jan-21 04:01 PM] ejuliano#8606
someone has to enable it... best if the team/community of LBC does it, i imagine


[08-Jan-21 04:01 PM] ejuliano#8606
ERC-20's can be added easily enough, if i'm not mistaken

not erc20

You don't know this yet because it hasn't been announced - situations like this will have a pipeline resolved by the end of H1 and even possibly earlier.

We've developed a community board proposal system and our busy implementing it and will be seeking community feedback for improving it during one of our Sprint runs.

It will allow for anybody to submit an idea, anybody else to follow up on it if they so choose, Komodo or community members to support these ideas by tagging them with bounties if desired or needed.

There's a category for perennial topics - topics similar "can we get X coin listed on AtomicDEX or into the DeFi protocol" is one of those.

"Can we partner with xxyy" is another.

"Can we get xxyy social media running" may be another example. 

This is one of the initiatives by which the goal is to provide high quality resources to us as a community so not everything is happening through Komodo platform Team.

Part of this goal personally is to take back the idea that Komodo is a community - those of us committing time and resources are all supporting each other to build towards what we believe in each of our ethos on freedom.

Some may see that as improving AtomicDex - a product that's come out of the Komodo workshop.

Others may see an opportunity to start a new team project and collaborate around it - maybe that project is an independent group forking a part of the tech stack or building out a new idea. 

Komodo as an identity belongs to everybody.

*heading note: ordered phases = discovery > exploration > implementation > education*
*discovery = can we do this?*
*exploration = ok we can do this, what's the pipeline/multi point plan for generate*
*implimentation = run multi point plan and determine outcome loop to exploration if needed or move on for minimum viable release* 
*education = create edu documentation and content resources for use - loop process starting at discovery for incremental improvement discovery* 


> Is this live (developed) or nearing release (implementing)?
It has finished discovery phase >  currently in exploration for clearest path for implementation.  Alpha release of this system will look simple as everything's goal for marketing side release is guided by the voice of "Start simple and build incremental improvements to fit the needs - review every 6 months, quarterly if major complaint is steadily in progress"

> Q: is kmd team working on a KBTC or KETH project?
I am unaware of a current exploration phase stage of this.  It is still looping in "discovery" - if this is a priority for you and you can identify being out of the discovery phase I will donate my time with you for a call to help you pass through exploration phase which is generally an operational heavy section.

Just for my 2c @Jcharming, the current DEX with BTC/ETH is not viable without KETH KBTC.


[08-Jan-21 09:04 PM] VJ#1796
I have $200 of BTC i want to spend on KMD, it will cost $60 for the fees. This problem will only grow.


[08-Jan-21 10:09 PM] Jcharming#2693
from spread or fees?


[08-Jan-21 10:28 PM] VJ#1796
@Jcharming Fees which leads to spreads which leads to using a CEX.

Want to plug you into this conversation that @TonyL started - follow along here, looks like latest answer is seeking an advanced function which allows users to click through to allow for fee adjustments.


[09-Jan-21 01:58 AM] VJ#1796
@Jcharming Fee adjustment is just a band aid solution. Having a KETH KBTC will lower the friction much more and would make the minimum volume moot.


[09-Jan-21 02:07 AM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
for this reason people who want their trades to settle fast, or make multiple subsequent trades will just choose CEX over DEX


[09-Jan-21 02:13 AM] Jcharming#2693
Two part:
Fee adjustment is not a band aid solution for on chain swapping.  

Wrapped coins are an additional answer - this isn't a one over the other, it's a confluence things.   Def interested and I think @Mylo makes comment above about looking into investigating.  Are you going to try to get involved to bring these markets to AtomicDEX and KMD? 

I think @polycryptoblog might have had some comments on wrapped coins and drawbacks which is a consideration to take into account.  Just spent time searching channels and didn't see it - adding the ping for him to drop a referesher if he has time and sees it.  Might have been something about security complications and complications to custodian ethos issues if I remember right? 
Any issues though don't lead to a closed door though - likely though doesn't help make higher priority when dev team has low bandwidth capacity.


[09-Jan-21 02:34 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Custodian issues and regulatory compliance for the gateway needed.   Also since komodo does not have tokens enabled nor crosschain swaps for its tokens , the wrapped coin would be its own chain and would not contribute to kmd demand.    We are in discussions with a 3rd party that is interested in wrapped coins can handle the legal requirements


[09-Jan-21 02:35 AM] VJ#1796
Verus is making bridges, maybe we can use their tech to resolve the custody issue?


[09-Jan-21 02:49 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
It’s not a custody issue for the tech side

[09-Jan-21 03:16 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
_isn't sure how 3rdparty gateways are still atomic swaps or why for the love of all that is crypto it would be needed or wanted to swap BTC_


[09-Jan-21 03:22 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Technically they are atomic swaps, just single chain.  Not what we are doing.  Why would a proxy be needed or wanted.  Quicker swaps, less fees.  People for some reason feel better having someone to blame for control over their coins.  Multisig .  From the gateway side,   rehypothecation ,  not tying down capital

[09-Jan-21 03:33 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
When I say gateway I’m not referring to the CC ,  but an entity .  Gateway / pegs could be used to create a wrapped type of solution but someone needs to run it , and that persons will sooner or later have liability.


[09-Jan-21 03:33 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
also:
> Technically they are atomic swaps, just single chain.
no, it's 3 chains instead of 2


[09-Jan-21 03:33 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
> but an entity 
yes, my reply is premised by that


[09-Jan-21 03:34 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
The swap just happening on one chain I mean


[09-Jan-21 03:35 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
It’s just token for token


[09-Jan-21 03:35 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I think I’m mixing some stuff up sorry I’m tired I see what you mean by 3 though


[09-Jan-21 03:37 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
so, rather than buying 200 KMD with my BTC, I'd have to buy some token that represents BTC with my BTC and then buy some token that represents KMD and then buy KMD with that
literally the anti-atomic sawp unless I always interpreted gazik and hern wrong 😕


[09-Jan-21 03:49 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Or could be a system like this: Deposit btc, receive proxy, earn interest on gateway deposit in exchange for gateway utilizing it,  use proxy on Atomicdex for swaps and or other things ( 10-20x faster, reduced fees proportional ) , when wanting to get real btc back, acquire proxy redeem for deposit and interest.   An atomic swap is just an exchange where the status of the trade will resolve in one state or another and not a mixed state.    Single chain swaps  typically spoken in reference to a native coin swapping with a token, but could be two tokens on the same chain. I agree two samechain proxy token  swaps may not be the most optimal


[09-Jan-21 03:53 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
how about just a system where I can dump my ETH for BTC because someone else already has a buy offer on the book and the process isn't halted because of some arbitrary min trade number we came up with in 2016 or 2017 to prevent dust trades?


[09-Jan-21 03:55 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Altering or removing is an option


[09-Jan-21 03:55 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
or, I guess, I could just forget why it was added and pretend to accept it has to do with current fees 🤷🏽


[09-Jan-21 04:00 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I don’t think that is a problem to remove the arbitrary limit to btc trade size , but like others have voiced doesn’t solve the undesirable characteristics of btc and eth swaps.


[09-Jan-21 04:01 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
I can see the appeal of wanting to "fix" such chains, but that's the nature of those chains


[09-Jan-21 04:05 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
To a certain extent, making it seem that they don't have those issues lends to making the issues worse
Because then there's the point where users believe they are cheap and easy to use, adoption goes up even more because of "hiding" the issues, and then more people try to use it for real and drive the actual tx fees even higher


[09-Jan-21 04:07 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
> OH WOW!!! BTC sucks to use this kind of fees, maybe I should look into alternatives. What's this KMD thing actually?
is far better, no?


[09-Jan-21 04:15 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
It would be optimal, but in practice it’s difficult to onboard people on to coins outside the top few with brand recognition.   Unfortunately most people in crypto are like talk trading folks “ Hurr Durr y number no go up? “,  until we get the rev pipelines flowing it will be hard to onboard with negative pressure from the btc eth fomo.    It is the eventual goal though to go that route, once revstreams come in steady.   Already starting to in some ways.  But it would be good for the community to prepare for when it does so we can push kmd as a viable alternative

@VJ 

Good consideration here - and a solid conversation about different implications when considering wrapped coins and custody vs ethos and atomic swaps.  ty @polycryptoblog appreciate you


[09-Jan-21 04:40 AM] Jcharming#2693
no - mean changing times.  When the sector was smaller it was more possible to be purely idealist... except you still needed to run an ICO to have a surge or profits to have an infusion of lifeblood off of...  only as it get more competitive in order to stay relevant and not simply wither and die out it may mean moving through different phases of consideration - all the stages have their own charm.

8. Regarding the liquidity pools, what are the incentives for people to create pools (e.g. like thornchains incentives to make pools for their BTC - ETH they incentivise larger pools by weighting the fees to be cheaper the larger they are) .  Seems the liquidity needs to be incentivised but as its not a pool per say it will be a bot that will aMM your wallets?


[14-Jan-21 08:50 AM] Monkins#5278
Also the trouble with the LP providers is the impermenant loss. Which is putting off LP providers  on other chains when there's large fluctuations. How would you address this.

0 conf was a really good feature in barterdex to speed up trades.

[21-Jan-21 11:21 AM] tolken#2655
@Jcharming Suggestion: 1. Orders ideally shouldn’t revert to ‘maker’ jobs by default, it should be fill or kill. It might be more effective to have the app continuously try and fill user’s requested amount as a ‘taker’ just like on a CEX. Having to pick an item from the orderbooks is cumbersome.

1) Crypto Targeted Promotion 2) Because your colleagues were interested in Cardano, I suggested to submit AtomicDex proposal to Project Catalyst, Cardano governance


[21-Jan-21 11:23 AM] Andrii#1591
And you can send the bounty, some people kept asking about it (not me, I'm expecting there to be some token), but if something else - would be interesting to test the trade

For starters, perhaps a video directly on the website that shows how to install, launch, and use adex

Reorganize UI, isn’t that a dev issue? (Just trying to understand how that’s distinct) ? Thought this fell under that category.

all you need to increase liquidity is getting more people running mm2 nodes and fund the coins


[21-Jan-21 11:29 AM] tolken#2655
I see, so you mean - you can do cosmetic changes to the GUI, but nothing that functionally changes? I suppose what I’m suggesting is a bit of both.


[21-Jan-21 11:30 AM] jspook16#3059
I would also suggest getting some of the information from dexstats website on adex itself. Such as 24 hour trades, volume, arbitrage opportunities, etc


[21-Jan-21 11:31 AM] tolken#2655
Got it - i’ll table these ideas for another session. Please let me know where I can contribute these ideas. I have some concrete ideas on this and arguably these are big friction points for many users.

@jspook16 yeah that’s a great idea

Yeah it made trading fun


[21-Jan-21 11:33 AM] tolken#2655
@Jcharming Suggestion 2: User shouldn’t pick BASE/REL by default. There should be a default list of pairs, possibly automatically aggregated by volume/trade activity. Users picking Base/Rel by hand should be an option, not a default workflow. The pairs should not ever be shown to the user as BTC/KMD, but should have a default priority/pair. So that would always be KMD/BTC.

It seems one of the more requested things is the WebDEX, which I can understand. Might be a bit too tough to do *legally* depending on your region. Ideally it would be something like Guarda and Magnum, where the keys are stored on your desktop or you temporarily import them or something.. idk, I wouldn't use it lol

Rewards for volume per month?


[21-Jan-21 11:41 AM] tolken#2655
Did. I hear that right?


[21-Jan-21 11:42 AM] tolken#2655
Here’s my concern with that point (just a thought) is that we do have liquidity now. I’m not certain liquidity is still the issue. It’s the likely the premiums. Even with a direct arbitrage system, makers still run a risk. Mitigating the risk is a big issue.


[21-Jan-21 11:43 AM] tolken#2655
The way I see it, we have liquidity now in many ways, the problem is that the primary way that makers attempt to protect themselves is via increasing premiums.


[21-Jan-21 11:43 AM] tolken#2655
Yeah, i work on it daily


[21-Jan-21 11:44 AM] tolken#2655
Well, rewards is sort of similar in a way to Uniswap fees - if that was offered by the team as a promotion, that would be a good incentive if it could be offered.


[21-Jan-21 11:44 AM] Regnar#6164
Decentralized Options contracts.
<https://discord.com/channels/412898016371015680/463445317136809984/766794939265974302>
TLDR: extend expiration time to be the life of the option. Send fee to maker, maker sends funds to HTLC, taker has until the end of contract life to send final payment (complete swap) otherwise they forfeit fee and funds expire. Add feature for them to track percentage in-the-money or out-of-the-money, ie. if they should buy.

we technically already have a free option contract enabled (with I believe a 4 hour expiration)

[21-Jan-21 11:46 AM] Regnar#6164
If you take from an orderbook and shut down the app, you could watch the price, if the price goes up you turn your app on and finish the trade, if it goes down you let it expire.


[21-Jan-21 11:47 AM] tolken#2655
@Regnar  yes i hope they dig into this. This would be fantastic if doable (long term)

[21-Jan-21 11:47 AM] Regnar#6164
technically I think it's already doable, but there is no compensation for the maker for these trades that expire. which sucks.

[21-Jan-21 11:49 AM] Regnar#6164
if there was a fee you send direct to maker (kind of how the fee goes to DEX address) in order to get the trade started on the Maker end. Then you would be free to finish the trade or let it expire, no harm.

I do really feel it was a productive conversation. 
There's traction here which is very viable for following up on.   And what we'll do is follow up on this and see what it turns into. 
To me this is small starts that could lead to bigger things - with the response today I can say it's worth the time to keep on doing and see how we can grow momentum with it.


[21-Jan-21 12:50 PM] Jcharming#2693
Yea I think that's fair - it was meant to be an open discussion.  I'm still not sure how everyone is going to react to me/us just taking the meeting by the horns and going down a checklist of notes.  And what I hear is you saying you'd like that, so we'll do it and get some direct feedback.

The most important thing for you to do in sharing these ideas is to come to the February workshops - where we'll have the time and space to follow these up more.  Because they are dedicated timeslots for this kind of thing. 
The open discussion that we just had are just meant to seed the starts to make sure what we bring to the workshops over the coming months is in line with community feedback - and when it's not to adjust and add in what you all highlight accordingly.


[21-Jan-21 01:06 PM] tolken#2655
@Jcharming I was thinking about the potential Atomicdex marketmaker incentive - Something like a quarter-percent of all trades, paid in KMD, could be really cool. Not necessarily permanent or automatic, but a monthly calculation/analysis of trades could reward makers. A quarter percent incentive would help tighten the premiums, slightly mitigate maker risk.... positive feedback loop. Could just be just a temporary stimulus. Maybe the incentive burden could be spread to other coin community. KMD pairs might be primarily incentivized by Komodo, but (just as an example) RVN/KMD might be subsidized partially by the RVN team. 0.125 from RVN, 0.125 from KMD.


[21-Jan-21 01:08 PM] tolken#2655
As I’ve mentioned before ‘liquidity’ being a problem is a complex situation. We arguably have liquidity for many pairs, but it is the premiums I suspect are what many users shy away from. A little incentive like this might go a long way, especially if other communities help. Communities do this on uniswap, rewarding liquidity providers with extra bonuses for adding to the LP, so this really would be quite similar.

Also, earlier I heard someone mention a "sprint" ... are you guys working in an Agile development environment? If so I was thinking it might be a good idea to layout a roadmap, per se, on the website, but it would include rough times lines of "who" is working what. The "who" can just be the user name of the develpoer/promoter but it gives people involved an eye view of what is "in work"

Do you have any ideas that don't involve dev asks that we can go after to create adoption for AtomicDEX

UI/UX (and the front end) specficially we can go after in these discussions.

[21-Jan-21 05:36 PM] jspook16#3059

it wouldn't be a big thing to add native support to GUIs, but you need to prepare the coin daemons, like importing the address for each passphrase you will use... so could result in many support questions

Yeah something like that...im just saying....most people will only give you a few mins of attention...so if all info is in one place readily available the odds are better of getting a new user


[21-Jan-21 05:47 PM] Jcharming#2693
Let me throw something at you. 

1.  Are you interested in AtomicDEX adoption? (assumed yes, but also checking) 

2.  If you had 400 uninterrupted hours to achieve adoption and a budget of 5,000 USD how would you do it?


[21-Jan-21 05:49 PM] jspook16#3059
Now we're talking.... so 5k budget. Dexstat info on ADEX, grandma video, social media, flyers at colleges, troll box, 0-conf


[21-Jan-21 05:50 PM] jspook16#3059
and something on website that shows who is working what....some insight into what is actually in work and what is in queue or what has been dismissed altogether

i would try to contact the devs/managers/CEOs of other coins and try to convince them to be listed on ADEX... maybe give them 6 months of free electrums (for the UTXO coins)... if it works fine, they will make the advertisement for us
a short list of potential candidates: LBC, SYS, VIA, VTC, BTX

The BTCZ Community is interested in being listed in ADEX and already push every tweet a lot.


[21-Jan-21 05:57 PM] Jcharming#2693
That's interesting


[21-Jan-21 05:59 PM] cipi#4502
yes, BTCZ is also such a candidate because it has electrumx support: https://github.com/spesmilo/electrumx/blob/master/electrumx/lib/coins.py#L1422
just need to setup the servers...

does adex have a reddit channel?


[21-Jan-21 06:00 PM] Jcharming#2693
@cipi @VandarGR   How would you feel if one of the workshops was dedicated to creating a public list of these projects to go after, and then every workshop we check in to see if there is any progress from anyone that is trying to get into contact or get done. 

Delton could provide some email copywrite and biz team could give some guidance.  I'd get involved in coordination efforts?


[21-Jan-21 06:00 PM] cipi#4502
no, but there is this channel: https://www.reddit.com/r/AtomicDEX/
no idea who "owns" it though

It's actually about the social media initiative.  This is where the reddit ideas would come in handy to spew out.

perhaps once there is a solid plan/outline ask the community for any donations

Its easier to get some extra money is people can see a "plan"

Def agree on if there ever is an ask for a donation from me it'll come with a 20 point plan and proposal

Thanks for coming to the open discussion more good ideas got thrown around.   Appreciating you all sharing ideas on what you'd like to go after and see highlighted during the Discover AtomicDEX February Push

another thing to think about is how to even get people to the work shops. I think some funds will need to be purposed for that possibly or some incentive to attend the work shops. Cause they could be great but low attendance could make them moot


[21-Jan-21 06:13 PM] Jcharming#2693
Yea we're doing some advertising right now through the roadmap to various audiences.  
I think that it's going to be something that we discover the best way to go about it in this space - I know I'm cautious to make a "pay for your participation" relationship as that's usually a short term relationship.


[21-Jan-21 06:13 PM] jspook16#3059
understood. thats just the first thing that popped into my head. I have no experience in marketing


[21-Jan-21 06:14 PM] Jcharming#2693
Keep those ideas coming - not shooting it down.  It's a good idea, just sharing my thoughts back


[21-Jan-21 06:15 PM] jspook16#3059
Another idea is having someone do a live stream during the trading competitions show some trades being done. That would make it fun...participating in the trade competition and watching someone actually making trades live


[21-Jan-21 06:15 PM] Jcharming#2693
Right now I'd be pleased if 4+ people attended each workshop through February - because even if it's small it's 
(i) consistent 
(ii) lets us create content 

I think as people see these workshops streamed live on youtube and twitter for weeks on end they'll start getting curious to follow along or even join discord and participate


[21-Jan-21 06:16 PM] Jcharming#2693
How about a "games" workshop for february? 
Which is a discussion to find what kind of games we could play for swap competitions on the DEX and settle on at least 1 good idea that I'll carry out?


[21-Jan-21 06:17 PM] Jcharming#2693
My personal goal is for each workshop to lead to **1** thing *at least* that I walk away with and carry out with or for the community

[21-Jan-21 06:22 PM] Jcharming#2693
it can actually be either 
workshop = produce something or 
workshop = come to a conclusion of something that should be produced within a specific topic on the meta topic. (ie for february that = atomicdex adoption)

We may not always be able to produce the actual product of our workshop within the time that workshop starts and ends or even feb starts and ends. 
But what we can do is say 
> workshop (2) will be exclusively on the topic of making a grandma video for AtomicDEX, during this workshop we're going to nail out together what that video content is going to look like and which things we should and shouldn't talk about within a 60s, 2min, 3 min, and 5min video.


[21-Jan-21 06:22 PM] jspook16#3059
do you guys think that "bridging verus liquidity pools with adex" could be a workshop? That would be a complicated dev effort i think. Too big in scope perhaps


[21-Jan-21 06:22 PM] jspook16#3059
Ok I understand now


[21-Jan-21 06:23 PM] Jcharming#2693
Then either several people will take that info away as tasks because they want to volunteer to make it and they'll drop it back to a collective google drive when done and marketing will market the fuck out of it - or I'll take it away with all the notes and mark ups if no one else can and hand it off to a video editor and say "this is what we want make this please" and then that will be the result of one of those workshops


[21-Jan-21 06:24 PM] Jcharming#2693
prob too big, but what if we had more community hangouts/open discussions after january besides just the workshops? And we picked specific topics?

one other question.... are you guys the leads for marketing for kmd or just adex?


[21-Jan-21 06:27 PM] jspook16#3059
or both

[21-Jan-21 06:33 PM] Jcharming#2693
We all do many things.  
@Delton is taking on daily responsibility of content management written (aka the blog) and making sure we have owned content for media 
@Jcharming is taking on coordination and operations responsibility which has a lot to do with structure, strategy, plan, and implementation of the ideas that float around
@Audo is acting as a guiding voice for all marketing department and holds a lot of responsibility for visual content and design as we move forward as well as making sure we're always pointed towards the important topics for success  (this is usually called "thought leadership"

We all do each others thing as well though and it's mostly just a commitment to grind everyday and find something to improve Komodo presence in the space about. 


If we were the website @Delton would be the words and blogs that fill it 
@Audo would be the one responsible for how it looks and that the words and visuals that fill it are representative on Komodo ethos
and @Jcharming is the one accountable for it's structure, pathing, and that it basically makes sense and gets built + what it gets used for afterwards. (aka every click and link has a purpose)

late thought for adex GUI - Order Editing - currently you have to cancel an order and create a new one if you want to edit a maker order


[21-Jan-21 09:34 PM] jspook16#3059
and automatic highlighting of fields in the Order Creation section. Otherwise you have to click in and navigate around the zero for Price and Volume

```If you had 400 uninterrupted hours to achieve adoption and a budget of 5,000 USD how would you do it?```

The money is not even close to any real marketing budget. It won't buy anything, and will be gone in a flash with zero results if you buy any ads. This is a tricky situation. The best strategy is to create a spectacle. Offer the whole $5000 as a trading prize. But the trading competition must come with a buy in. (No free rick/morty competition) People mentally assign more value to something that is not free. Plus funds raised get carried over to the next competition. I'd recommend creating 5 coins to use for the trade competition. Create an order book for one of these coins, kmd/coin 1, then trade coin 1 for coins 2,3,4. Create order books to go from coin 2,3,4 to coin 5. Coin 5 also has an order book where the person with the most coin5 can trade for $5000. Of course nspv support would make this easier as you would not need electrum servers (nspv support also encourages kmd ecosystem growth)


[22-Jan-21 04:47 AM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
This strategy also shows off how to create coins on kmd platform, and how to list them on AtomicDex. It assigns value to adex because we are willing to put up $5000. And it creates a spectacle that gets eyes on it. 

Titties! 
Did I just get your attention?

in a $914,357,338,719 market, $5k attracts those that __need__ $5k, not those that will stick around after they get it

good article about inventory risk of market makers: https://hummingbot.io/blog/2020-10-inventory-risk/
btw, developing a ADEX connector for hummingbot would be very useful


[22-Jan-21 06:47 AM] cipi#4502
can we start a vote "Which ERC20 token do you want to trade on ADEX?"?
many of them will be added to 0.4.0: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicdex-desktop-generics/blob/main/config/0.4.0-coins.json and i would like to know which ones i should enable in my mmbot

Not necessarily. And the goal was how to spend this $5000, which is a very low amount to use as marketing. So low, that I posit you can't really buy any meaningful marketing. In this scenario, getting coin communities to advertise for you is the way. $5000 prize puts eyes on the adex and gets people to dl and use. Was that not the goal? Customer retention comes by repeating these events. And if we are trying to attract liquidity providers (with millions) we need users as well.


[22-Jan-21 07:53 AM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
And or, what specifically target audience are we trying to reach? Millionaire liquidity providers, or users? Or grandma?


[22-Jan-21 07:53 AM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
Or shape shift?


[22-Jan-21 07:54 AM] cipi#4502
all of them, if possible 🙂


[22-Jan-21 07:56 AM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
By making the competition a buy in, we at least filter out those with no money anyway, which probably won't stick around


[22-Jan-21 07:57 AM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
The main stumbling block is having to setup electrum servers


[22-Jan-21 07:58 AM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
However, competition coins would only exist for a few days so chain size should be small and less resource intense

On that, we agree
> $5000 prize puts eyes on the adex and gets people to dl and use.
I posit that  it wouldn't and would, rather, only attract the people already familiar with its existence who will again quit using it immediately or shortly after


[22-Jan-21 08:17 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
grandma isn't going here there and everywhere to sign up for "winnings"
"millionaires" can't be assed to do that, either
so you're looking at a "target" of people that keep the majority (or in many cases, all) of their coinage on a CEX because they can't be assed to download things


[22-Jan-21 08:17 AM] Jcharming#2693
You really didn't get the exercise of the question.  
The 5k isn't your comp - it's your project resource budget.  

.....


[22-Jan-21 08:18 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
I get the question, you just don't get the answer:

no one is getting anything useful or meaningful done with $5k


[22-Jan-21 08:18 AM] Jcharming#2693
For going after 1 thing, and what is that 1 thing you would go after.  
Has nothing to do with overall budget - resources - or anything else.  
It's a question for you and you alone.


[22-Jan-21 08:19 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
get a bigger budget


[22-Jan-21 08:19 AM] Jcharming#2693
Ok make it 10k budget and 400 free hours.  What would you do?

Hey if you don't have anything you could do with 400 hours and 5k/10k budget that's your answer.  
No biggie - idgaf.  You're asking for community involvement, I'm bringing you open discussions & direct questions - we all do what we can with the opportunities given - you want to pump gas.  Heard.

Then, you're hearing the wrong thing....
if you want involvement in 2021 then you have to spend like it's not 1921

@ComputerGenie  can you elaborate on the $ thrown at barterdex? I wasn't on slack


[22-Jan-21 08:31 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
yes, I get that "$5k is hypothetical", what seems to be lacking is that I'm saying that the hypothetical is flawed on its face because it's based in the wrong century 
"What would the average person do for 2500 KMD?"
the answer is still
"mostly nothing because it's not enough to garner interest"

[22-Jan-21 08:34 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
competition after competition with 7777 KMD as a prize
random dropins from "Ambassadors" dropping 777-7777 KMD
had to have been at least 100k KMD dropped on participants in 3-6 months, just for being there and alive
no "sign up as part of this blog and get this email to use this thing" crap
actual funds to actual people for actual participation


[22-Jan-21 08:34 AM] Churro#4832
I feel like people are searching for liquidity pools with high interest. When will the atomicdex have liquidity pools


[22-Jan-21 08:36 AM] jspook16#3059
Perhaps there may be a way to bridge verus liquidity pools with adex but it would take some dedicated dev effort and funds


[22-Jan-21 08:36 AM] Jcharming#2693
Why didn't you say you'd use the 400 hours and 5k budget to run 1 competition with 5k worth of prizes?


[22-Jan-21 08:36 AM] Jcharming#2693
Easy low hanging fruit based on what you're saying is good quality stuff in this comment


[22-Jan-21 08:36 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
because I wouldn't


[22-Jan-21 08:37 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
this "hypothetical" prize would still only be worth less than 1/3rd of what it used to be


[22-Jan-21 08:38 AM] Jcharming#2693
That's legit.  Help me out I'm struggling to figure out what to figure out you'd do besides 'pamp gas'  - anything you'd actually do yourself if you had the time and funding to complete it?

Yea I'm with you on this.


[22-Jan-21 08:39 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
I would find a way to take that 400 hours and turn the $5k into a budget that would do something meaningful and not miss most people or be some random 1off


[22-Jan-21 08:39 AM] Jcharming#2693
Yea, but WHAT would you do?


[22-Jan-21 08:39 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
the answer is:
don't do it, figure out how to do something bigger

[22-Jan-21 08:41 AM] Churro#4832
before


[22-Jan-21 08:41 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
I would figure out how to turn that $5k into $50k before doing anything else
then figure out how to do something meaningful with that $50k and fail to come up with the answer
then
I would figure out how to turn that $50k into $150k before doing anything else


[22-Jan-21 08:42 AM] Jcharming#2693
How would you do it?

Agreed - money makes a poor relationship.  It's relationship starter though - the stress test gave us about a 40% boost in active email subs alone which is a long term relationship. Twitter our main audience has a boost in active engagement and dispersion as a result too.

My interest in competition comes from being tech support for the ironman triathlon, the second largest 10k race in america (it drew 54,000 people every year), and the Race Across America. Three different competitions, with different audiences. Yes Genie is right that alot of the same people participate, year after year. However word of mouth, does bring in new competitors every year. The Ironman for instance ( not the hawaii race, but all the other ones) did so well, that they were responsible for putting that brand on the map. So whereas Genie is right about alot of the same people participating, he is wrong in the momentum that builds via brand and word of mouth.


[22-Jan-21 08:58 AM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
Barterdex, was not user friendly, so the participants were very limited to a small group. Adex has a much larger user audience


[22-Jan-21 09:00 AM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
Competition is marketing, and that is really what we are after. $5000 for a competition, the marketing effect will be worth way more than that.


[22-Jan-21 09:02 AM] Jcharming#2693
go take your shower - emails can be used to proactively follow up with people.  
Anyone can purge at anytime - there's only 2 types of relationships  in this scope. 

short, which equals one encounter with no chance to follow - a relationship over an activity
long, which equals an encounter that summates in the ability to follow up into another connection. 

This is why trolls exist - it's a persistent relationship based on abusive tactics.  The desire for a long term relationship, but without any of the substance of quality that brings relief.  A scarcity mindset for connection.


[22-Jan-21 09:06 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
insinuating that one is a troll rather than someone that is invested is a great way to make a long a short


[22-Jan-21 09:06 AM] Jcharming#2693
In the steps of 
*  Connection 
*  Retention 
*  Provocation 

Engagement is a topic that covers all three depending on who the audience members have self identified as.  
The actions that people commit to gives clues to which roles they've identified as.  
Engagement is usually lumped into *Retention* only - it's actually a meta-process.

I feel like it would definitely help with atomicDEX adoption. I went thru every single DEX on CMC yesterday and pretty much 95% were just eth based ones


[22-Jan-21 09:18 AM] lightspeed393#5403
not only would it help share atomicDEX by showing it's an option, it would allow smaller coins not listed on CEX's to have price data on CMC


[22-Jan-21 09:18 AM] Jcharming#2693
In agreement with a lot of what you're saying here - there is a momentum effect.  
It's a series of expansion and contraction cycles. 

Awareness Campaign (Connection) to 10k people 
Ability to follow up (retention) of 2k people
Distillation/Identification of those people (retention) desire and ability to get involved again 
-  500 people willing to come to the next event
-  80 people willing to come to synchronous communication channels on a regular basis 
Creating events  and inviting (provocation)  those 500 + 80 people to said events 

If we spend 10k USD for the initial awareness of 10k people and got 500 + 80 people then just for the quant analysis of $$ => people in a best situation we spent.
$3.87 USD each for locating and having a long term relationship
* 2000 people's DM's/follows 
*  500 people that will come back to another event
*  80 people willing to participate in some form of synchronous communication


[22-Jan-21 09:19 AM] Jcharming#2693
*these info example mockups are made from direct data results of the AtomicDEX stress test*


[22-Jan-21 09:21 AM] Jcharming#2693
If we further this out to $$ relationship outcomes the next step is provocation to gain that $3.87 back from each person transforming intangible value into direct USD value.  Which would be the next step for "provocation"


[22-Jan-21 09:24 AM] lightspeed393#5403
@Jcharming continuing on what I was saying above, does the team have that planned for the future? I discovered recently @TonyL has a repo that was being worked on for creating a CMC endpoint, but hasn't been updated in a month or so. Just wondering if that's still in the works or not, or if the team is looking into other options.


[22-Jan-21 09:32 AM] Jcharming#2693
it ebbs and flows depending on what other people bring here - there's other high quality things here. 
I liked the idea of the verus liquidity bridge - but can't follow up on it without dev asks. hmmmm


[22-Jan-21 09:39 AM] Jcharming#2693
At the moment the main barrier to entry for CMC <> AtomicDEX listing as an exchange is legitimacy it appears.  And through 2 values. 
1. Low awareness
2. Low volume/liquidity

Solutions for (1) are dealt with by having active noise and media attention in the space, but this takes time to build - like an SEO/SERP crawler.  This is most of the awareness focus for the first 6 months of the year. 

Solutions for (2) are built into 040 and the followup starting in February about "Discover AtomicDEX" and those workshops follow up to get some virality, which also helps (1).  As well as the dev team building and supporting AtomicDEX 040 is a lot more confident about more people showing up and trading coins other than test coins and not running into a *we accidentally started a smoke test without realizing it* situation.


[22-Jan-21 09:40 AM] Jcharming#2693
These are the best answers I have atm @lightspeed393


[22-Jan-21 09:47 AM] lightspeed393#5403
I understand that it helps to have more awareness and volume on AtomicDEX, but from what I can see on their listing criteria page, there are no set requirements to the amount of volume/users the exchange needs to be tracked. It's mostly all about providing api data about prices/ordersbooks/coins/volume of trading etc. and not how much of any of those things exist. 

Here's the exact text from their listing page for reference: 
```For an exchange to be considered for a tracked listing, it should meet the following guidelines:

    1. A functional website with trading volume that matches its API data.
    2. Must publish a summary API endpoint that exposes the last price and 24h volume of each cryptoasset. 
        See sample of an ideal API endpoints. Exchanges must include a variable for ‘type’ of market to help us distinguish derivatives (e.g. perpetual swaps, options, physically-delivered futures) from spot markets.
    3. Must be in operation for at least sixty days (The number of days that affiliated exchanges/projects of the same name have been in operation counts towards this requirement).
    4. Must allow traders to place buy and sell orders on an orderbook. DEXes with no orderbook data will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.
    5. Must allow users to view all market pairs/order books without the need to log-in to the website.
    6. Must have direct URLs that display each asset unambiguously (full asset name and/or logo), preferably with a ‘System Status’ page that shows all listed assets.
    7. Must be able to provide a representative from the exchange with whom we can establish open lines of communication for any clarifications.
    8. Requests originating from emails that share the domain of the exchange will be prioritized.
```


[22-Jan-21 09:51 AM] lightspeed393#5403
I personally think the exchange tracking on CMC would help a lot with bringing that awareness and volume that you speak of. It's one of those what comes first, the chicken or the egg type of scenarios. Just thought I'd throw it out there.


[22-Jan-21 09:56 AM] Jcharming#2693
There are elements of this that I know are barriers to entry beyond the completion of the API (or so I'm currently thinking so) 

CC: @polycryptoblog  Do you have an awareness of which of these items beyond the API data are blockers - looking for an extra update myself to make sure I'm up to knowledge on this.  

ty @lightspeed393 -  maybe this is a workshop topic for February?  
The workshops can be used to create a multipoint plan that is then run down and followed up with.  Curriculum design is serious barrier to success and I'm starting to gravitate towards having workshops highlight having a "take away" answer of do x,y,z - taken from the community.

`1. A functional website with trading volume that matches its API data.`

I'm pretty sure this is the clause that acts as a filter and gives permission for CMC to deny anyone and the issue I ran into when last contacting them.


[22-Jan-21 10:12 AM] Jcharming#2693
the `with trading volume` isn't to say the API needs volume - it's to also say that there needs to BE volume to get considered past step 1.

Still waiting on the checkin from poly


[22-Jan-21 10:14 AM] lightspeed393#5403
I don't think the exchange has to have trading on the site for DEX's. For example Bisq is listed on CMC. but you can't trade on their site. You still have to download the software to trade. They just provide the API data on their site that matches what the software provides.

[22-Jan-21 10:54 AM] Jcharming#2693
@lightspeed393 discord channels and the like by nature are not static topics.  They are all synchronous conversations - this is one of the reasons that there is an aim to set up a Community Improvement Proposal system as one of the major results of March efforts.  Because a long standing issue is that things get discussed in discord and then lost in the jumble.


[22-Jan-21 10:55 AM] lightspeed393#5403
well it will surely be lost when changing from one name to another. why not just create a new channel?


[22-Jan-21 10:55 AM] Jcharming#2693
we also don't need a million channels to pretend that discord is asynchronous communication.

[22-Jan-21 10:57 AM] Jcharming#2693
They'll still see their pings and reference it - they might not even respond in this channel - there might be more discussion before they even get to it.


[22-Jan-21 10:57 AM] lightspeed393#5403
maybe make a github repo then, so certain important things like we discussed can be saved in issues not lost in transition/discussion


[22-Jan-21 10:58 AM] Jcharming#2693
Actually you're very close to what the plan looks like for the proposal system.  A kanban style improvement proposal on github that requires very little managment.  Then when these discussions happen we can link it to eachother as a workspace

I think you may are working on it but making a sort of "personae" of your typical crypto audience and then map where they are (99% surf on the web/90% are on social media/etcetc). Adoption, engagement can be done externally in addition to your internal effort thanks to "influencers" on social media whith whom you partnership.


[22-Jan-21 11:17 AM] Brobrowniz#9013
The important here is ONLY their engagement rate which has to be +4% for a decent result.


[22-Jan-21 11:17 AM] Brobrowniz#9013
You can hunt influencer and engagement rate thx with tools like Upfluence.


[22-Jan-21 11:19 AM] Brobrowniz#9013
And of course the story you build with them.


[22-Jan-21 11:23 AM] Jcharming#2693
I'm really looking forward to seeing you in the March workshops - do you have an interest in doing social media management?

It's been on my boards for something to go after - how do you feel if 2nd half of the year we started running some basic edu courses and meet up groups and purchase udemy courses and things of this nature.  Make them free for community members?

I will be there since we are building this kind of strategy for our startup. Like most of us (I guess) I am not of fan of it but I know it is a must to do, so I keep learning and testing things.

Something we're really missing right now is social media managers - it takes time and atm between @Audo  @Delton @Jcharming we can't handle it - and twitter honestly exists because of @thebaselinetest , but it takes everything else we're building to give that twitter meaningful funnels to talk about.


[22-Jan-21 11:39 AM] Brobrowniz#9013
I feel you, it is very time consuming. Your idea of recruiting a internship is a good start, maybe she/he will become your Senior ^^


[22-Jan-21 11:43 AM] paco#7277
love the courses idea, ya need to run with that, i would defo be in


[22-Jan-21 11:43 AM] Jcharming#2693
This exactly ☝ - would love to have someone come in that has an interest in taking ownership on these things bc right now we just don't have someone to do that - but we have the ability now to make it happen operationally is possible now.

This will remain #townhall-chat and 🔊Roundtable Voice channels -  live stream for April Campaign plan discussion going on. 

If you want to find out a little more about what we're looking to do in April and give some suggestions on what you'd like to see highlighted in these workshops this is a good place to get your voice heard from within the community here or watching the live stream.  These discussions are directly effecting the content choices about what we'll be doing these workshops on for the next 5 months.

People dont understand why use adex although its probatly more easier and faster to do it on uniswap, sushiswap or another cex


[26-Jan-21 11:43 AM] Jcharming#2693
The best reason is because of security.  It's an interesting challenge to show that security = sexy

This could be an easy understandable and short ad

Komodo dPow seems to be the main product offering of the Komodod deamon reference coin kmd. This is facilitated by the komodo notary network. Are there other possible product offerings the notary network can facilitate? Such as dexp2p or(?) in order to create more revenue streams? @PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator  @ComputerGenie

@Jcharming if there are spare resources


[28-Jan-21 07:15 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I think if integration isn’t too hard, the 250,000ton reward equating to 100k usd would be quite easy to win over.

Seeing as our dex is pretty much built ready to go.. when asked, I got this reply 

“It is not UTXO based but there is a time lock function smart contract and the utxo emulating token if you need it for whatever reason”

I think if integrate, check if compatible with their staking, then first prize should be very easy to claim


[28-Jan-21 07:16 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Then there’s the additional proposals you can put through (once it’s integrated anyway if it’s done) where you can get paid x amount every sign up / trade etc for continual passive income for a few years pending contract terms

Maybe worth a reach? 😂


[30-Jan-21 01:57 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Crabby Paddy want to make it?


[30-Jan-21 01:57 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
suggest coin supply


[30-Jan-21 01:58 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I have no idea how to do it @grewalsatinder


[30-Jan-21 01:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I can help


[30-Jan-21 01:58 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
But the no legal troubles part sounds like something dIco can do


[30-Jan-21 01:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it is single line


[30-Jan-21 01:58 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I think even better is to just make the coin, get as much of our community as we can


[30-Jan-21 01:58 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
to comment / message saying it is done


[30-Jan-21 01:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
no dICO nothing shady


[30-Jan-21 01:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
simple old mining


[30-Jan-21 01:58 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
can always change parameters or make a new chain


[30-Jan-21 01:58 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Just to get his attention


[30-Jan-21 01:58 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
in the first place


[30-Jan-21 01:58 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
having the coin made should grab his eye imo


[30-Jan-21 01:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay


[30-Jan-21 01:59 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Then if he opens communications, can always cater to what he wants exactly


[30-Jan-21 02:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I don't know who is saulja boy, some rapper/singer I guess. but since he has good following, helping with such thing is not bad idea


[30-Jan-21 02:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
bought relevant domain too


[30-Jan-21 02:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
figuring out miningable specification


[30-Jan-21 02:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

Someone had a first-dibs up sorts on the AtomicDex stress test results. Did they end up using it or will details from the test finally come out directly from Komodo team? @Jcharming @Audo


[31-Jan-21 12:22 AM] webworker01#3884
i dunno, wasn't sure if that's why it's not switched over

@Jcharming has kmd had conferences before?

Site looks cool, but am i the only one who thinks its weird that when you click on the main buttons “Business, developer or community” nothing changes on the page. You have to scroll down to see anything.

[31-Jan-21 12:32 AM] tolken#2655
It’s like a visual demo / interactive demo of how Komodo works. Very cool - seems like this should be more prominent.


[31-Jan-21 12:33 AM] tolken#2655
@Pumtchak very very cool so far! Nice work! I love stuff like this. Really helps communicate ideas!

it work badly on mobile i think


[31-Jan-21 12:38 AM] Jcharming#2693
@here  There is a cache system flush that needs to be done which sadly we don't have permissions to reach and do - BUT as soon as @ca333 is up and around he'll take care of it.  I think he has sole access and I didn't know that and failed to submit a request for it - I"m taking the bullet on this one.

We'll still livestream it from our test server site - and it's ok because it can take a few hours to update through the crawler everywhere too.  : )


[31-Jan-21 12:40 AM] jspook16#3059
@Pumtchak yeah hard to see in mobile but still awesome

@Audo the ‘rust’ link on the Developer>KomodoSDKAlpha menu takes user to Atomicdex github, rather than docs. Don’t think this is right is it?


[31-Jan-21 05:46 PM] Jcharming#2693
This is correct for now - unless you think there is a specific spot of Rust Dev Docs that we missed which would be a better point to.  
This is specifically for devs/jrdevs that interested in using Rust in the blockchain space to let them know they can do it here.

unrelated question....what day is the atomicdex workshop?


[01-Feb-21 11:33 AM] tolken#2655
@Jcharming I don’t know, its odd to me to drop someone to the Atomicdex github repository without any explanation when all of the surrounding links take you to SDK docs that each have an overview/introduction explaining what it is.  I’d recommend at the very least, link to a landing page that explains why they’re being referred to the AtomicDex github.  Alternatively, the “Rust” link should mention Atomicdex, so they know that’s where its going.


[01-Feb-21 11:34 AM] tolken#2655
I’d consider linking to here: https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/atomicdex/introduction-to-atomicdex.html , possibly to a ‘rust’ sub-section in the Atomicdex docs, if that’s what the goal is. It would be less disorienting and meaningful to new developers.

[02-Feb-21 12:15 AM] tolken#2655
I don’t know, maybe I just don’t get it. Every other link makes sense in its description and where it takes you, that link is to “RUST” which of course is a programming language. Below Rust, it describes as “API for modern blockchain apps” How is Rust an API for blockchain apps? Why would this link to AtomicDex-API, other than the fact its written primarily in Rust? I don’t want to make this a bigger issue than it needs to be, I’m just expressing my impression. @gcharang  - linking to the AtomicDex install/setup I’m not sure that is any more clear.


[02-Feb-21 12:16 AM] tolken#2655
Isn’t the new name for mm2, KomodoDefi or something? Shouldn’t that link be named “KomodoDefi API - API for modern blockchain apps”  instead of “Rust - API for modern blockchain apps” ?


[02-Feb-21 12:18 AM] Jcharming#2693
@tolken I don't think you're making it a bigger issue than it needs to be.  I think the problem right now is that Rust and it's connection to the project is quite new but we know it's going to get more robust.  
So from a metal level even though each link doesn't match the same style of linking to the same place. 

I think we'd want the link to be something that if a rust to dev showed up and scrolled the page and saw rust and clicked on it they'd feel incentivized to poke around a blockchain project that was using rust.

With that in mind the link to the repo seems like the strongest one we have right now since we don't have documentation strictly talking about rust. 
Do you think in this situation that makes more or less sense?
Very open to feedback on here


[02-Feb-21 12:21 AM] tolken#2655
It does. And not to create more work for the team, but I will refer back to what I said initially on the topic. An ideal solution would be to point to a landing page, or existing page with a  short description of this where it lists what has adopted Rust, why rust is being adopted and will continue to be adopted going forward. Below that description would be a list of API/SDK items that utilize it. In this case, we’d have one item, AtomicDex-API.


[02-Feb-21 12:22 AM] tolken#2655
A one or two sentence expressing the Komodo teams interes and/or commitment to using Rust going forward is all it would take.

maybe atomicdex wallet could have a portion of social media engagement reward tool that allows scan qr-code as privatekey of wallet and spends that to users own wallet. that way it would be easy way to motivate people to seek to find qr code that will reward fastest finder.


[08-Feb-21 11:40 AM] Jcharming#2693
this is very interesting could you write up a little but more of how you'd expect this to work and it's function so we can get a better idea?


[08-Feb-21 11:41 AM] Jcharming#2693
This is the kind of thing to bring to growth strategy too btw

qr code holds privatekey and allows reward to be collected automatically by wallet.


[08-Feb-21 11:42 AM] Jcharming#2693
Yes I understand the basics of this need a more fleshed out idea to pursue and in depth explainer.  Do you think you can provide that or is this the limit you can put out of this idea?


[08-Feb-21 11:43 AM] Mark81#4505
easyway for noobies to get rewarded by giving attentuin to us. just an idea from me. needs devs to work out this to mobile wallet.


[08-Feb-21 11:45 AM] Jcharming#2693
Yes it's a good idea - what I"m asking for is can you push yourself to flesh out this idea more?  If so it'll make it more understandable and then we could prob pick it up and move on it. 
Like can you do 100 words explaining what you mean and exploring what the idea would look like?

please ping @marketing-team and we'll scoop it up - this process is what we'll be moving towards.  Help us with fleshing out discovery and then our goal will be to pick things up and move directly to implementation goals. Some ideas are more straight forward than others - but if someone (like you) is holding a high quality idea in your head this is the best way to get traction on it so it doesn't stall out.

this could letterly be on every aspect of komodo marketing and article write ups. these could be called also active user rewards.  little qr codes hided or at plain sight to be collected. not big value but dollar at most.


[08-Feb-21 11:54 AM] Mark81#4505
but main thing would be atomicdex mobile wallet allows easy collecting of them.

We made an ANNC that PR is making it a part of the Feb push and we got an extension to do so.   - It's not uncommon when trying to land major news to take a quarter (around 3 months) to land a major push for best positioning.  We're holding onto the detail stats ANNC until then - but there is a basic results available in the blog  <https://blog.komodoplatform.com/en/atomicdex-stress-test-initial-results/>

Social media engament rewarding.  

This idea is based on my previous discussion  on this week.

My idea was that when komodo team publishes articles/videos or twitter tweets on internet then those would hold QR-code that is readable by AtomicDEX wallet and when reading with wallet it would tricker automatic receiving of funds that were set to be collected by marketing team in their posts. Technically this remains to be solved by devs but i think it possible. Receiving these little funds could be called ’active user social media rewards’. Current AtomicDEX wallet holds a section that is on used by users claiming  5,1% APR for kmd and this portion could have also ’claim social media active reward’ which would open camera for Qr-scanning. 

These little rewards could be value around dollar or two for people that take time an effort to read komodo marketing team posts or watching their video updates and have value from their time by doing so. Also there would be needed fast interaction to these posts. I dont know but with CC (crypto conditions  system) would it be possible that there would be reward like to first 5 fastest claimer with same qr code? So that these rewards wouldn’t be always first takes them all. It would get this way more people be using and intrested komodo flagship AtomicDEX wallet since most of technology features will be built inside that in future.

Also this QR-code reader could be widened in future like receiving little collectables NFT’s that are like designed by Komodo team and themed as KMD fan collectables once tech is ready for that. And those would be tradeadble through atomicdex as well in future.

thanks @Mark81 ! I saved your idea. We won't have the bandwidth to implement such things in the near future, but we are thinking of the long-term vision for AtomicDEX in connection to the underlying marketing/adoption strategy this month, so these types of ideas are very valuable.

Hi @Mark81 
I have interest in original ways to increase social media activity.
Is it something you would like to discuss?


[10-Feb-21 07:06 AM] Jcharming#2693
This is a great idea!  

Furthering this topic - 
What are ways you envision that this could be done without dev asks *or* that you can define the list of dev asks in order to complete ?
*ie list the dev asks for success*


[10-Feb-21 07:07 AM] Jcharming#2693
Drop the ideas here and ping @marketing-team will be plugged in - looking forward to hearing about them.


[10-Feb-21 07:10 AM] Mark81#4505
easiest way this can be done with link to faucet i guess with lesser dev work.


[10-Feb-21 09:29 AM] Jimm B.#9993
are there any plans to integrate an NFT market into AtomicDEX? and  maybe some kind of antara NFT maker?


[10-Feb-21 09:48 AM] Jcharming#2693
Antara as a name/identity is getting de-prioritized.  There are plans for NFT marketplace inclusion in AtomicDEX app, but they are in the planning phase atm.

We can keep this conversation going - what I'm trying to do is remove things that are disappeared into statements like 
> Technically this remains to be solved by devs but i think it possible.
And figuring out what we can do that doesn't have a dev ask - or takes something existing and we investigate tweaking it (like your mention of the claim rewards options) Then seeing how to fit that into the narrative someone presents so we can act on it. 

This is a great idea, and it's still at an abstract non-starter place.  What ways can we refine it more?


[10-Feb-21 10:27 AM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
How to prevent bots and single persons from draining funds? How to make sure people are reading these? How to prevent abuse of this system? How to make it work with what we have now so no additional dev resources need use?

One way to make this work is for the qr code to link to a faucet (faucet has limits of one per day). The faucet coin (worthless promo coin) once obtained is used to make a trade on AtomicDex. The marketing team puts orders on dex of kmd/promo coin. These orders only last 1 day so very hard to scam faucet.


[10-Feb-21 10:30 AM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
Will need to setup a faucet, promo coin nodes, and list on dex


[10-Feb-21 01:17 PM] Seko#7408
Are there considerations to publish $DEX and if so, with which ticker? 

What are the further plans with the coin? Wouldn't it be possible to have a coin that rewards AtomicDEX users to give liquidity? How does Komodo plan to solve the problem of low liquidity?

thanks @Seko , we can answer these in the townhall

Yeah based on donations from community for the bounty


[11-Feb-21 06:38 AM] jspook16#3059
so 0.3.2 is really already 0.4???


[11-Feb-21 06:42 AM] jspook16#3059
The change log for 0.3.1.2 says they only added WSB and Souljacoin (pre-built release)


[11-Feb-21 06:46 AM] jspook16#3059
@Audo @Delton @Jcharming ca333 had said that although the app show 0.4, that it was not really 0.4. The change log says they only added WSB and soulja


[11-Feb-21 06:47 AM] jspook16#3059
I think that if 0.4 is already out, then i can see the build up to 0.4 not being as good.


[11-Feb-21 06:49 AM] jspook16#3059
app says 0.4.....github says 0.3.1.2 ....but CA333 i think said it was not really 0.4

If what im using now is really 0.4, I did not really notice a difference from 0.3.1.1 to the pseudo 0.4


[11-Feb-21 06:56 AM] jspook16#3059
@PTYX do you have the changelog for 0.4?


[11-Feb-21 06:59 AM] jspook16#3059
I found the change log for the 0.4 version ....i think it really is 0.4 😦


[11-Feb-21 07:00 AM] jspook16#3059
I sense some of the cohesiveness disintegrating...


[11-Feb-21 07:00 AM] PTYX#6840
it was just a hotfix that sort of messed up the release cycle but nothing that can't be coordinated


[11-Feb-21 07:02 AM] jspook16#3059
There might be a way to salvage it though. UI wise not much changed, seems like mostly backend changes. So perhaps the changes can be advertised as back end


[11-Feb-21 07:02 AM] jspook16#3059
So even though it might already be out .... the back end changes can still be explained and demo'ed


[11-Feb-21 07:02 AM] PTYX#6840
yeah, i don't see it as a big issue but we just need to make sure we're all on the same page


[11-Feb-21 07:03 AM] PTYX#6840
we do have to be practical about it though, because hot releases do happen and will happen in the future


[11-Feb-21 07:04 AM] jspook16#3059
Yeah it just seems that marketing had built around that release so i see their point of view as well.


[11-Feb-21 07:05 AM] PTYX#6840
yea me too


[11-Feb-21 07:06 AM] PTYX#6840

[11-Feb-21 07:10 AM] samurai321#0681
it doesn't matter if you name it 0.3.xx on github and 0.4.0 beta 2 in the interface or something, as long as there aren't bugs and people lose their money!


[11-Feb-21 07:12 AM] jspook16#3059
@Jcharming Personally i did not notice a difference from the previous and the latest. So if the latest is 0.4, then UI wise i dont see much of a change. Biggest change seems to be the mm2.1 change which can still be demo'ed and explained i think. So it might be possible to salvage the marketing efforts


[11-Feb-21 07:18 AM] jspook16#3059

[12-Feb-21 09:40 AM] daemonfox#6136
To many chains

Dragon Doge


[12-Feb-21 09:55 AM] jspook16#3059
will there be some Doge liquidity available? It would suck to have people join and no Doge available


[12-Feb-21 10:00 AM] jspook16#3059
one thing I will say is that even if they are selling to themselves....the orders are still public so other people can pick them up


[12-Feb-21 10:00 AM] Jcharming#2693
Yes w've got a 75% clear path to maximizing liquidity for one asset support during the swap competition 
a 50% clear path for having some bulk access to major liquidity as a spike just for that weekend


[12-Feb-21 10:03 AM] jspook16#3059
Thats why in the future....we need to integrate verusIDs ....then it becomes expensive to have 10000 IDs....and its still anonymous


[12-Feb-21 10:04 AM] jspook16#3059
Registering will reduce attendance i think


[12-Feb-21 10:06 AM] Jcharming#2693
agreed, it's on the boards and it's not a clear path or available to do right now (within next two weeks)


[12-Feb-21 10:19 AM] jspook16#3059
The concern is that on subsequent competitions....there may be enough funds in the wild to clean out the kmd. I think if we just keep track of how many swap coins are out....and always keep a ratio of kmd to swap coin....it might be ok


[12-Feb-21 10:19 AM] jspook16#3059
if 3k swap are still in the wild that means there is 3k of kmd still left right?


[12-Feb-21 10:19 AM] jspook16#3059
or whatever the ratio is


[12-Feb-21 10:26 AM] Jcharming#2693

@Jcharming are you going to point out that atomicdex does lack the ability to go fiat to crypto?


[12-Feb-21 01:03 PM] daemonfox#6136
All DEX will have this issue


[12-Feb-21 01:05 PM] jspook16#3059
see you guys


[12-Feb-21 01:06 PM] Jcharming#2693
Actually - as soon as a coin/project gets listed that solves fiat<>crypto problem AtomicDEX is the first dex to support that - even during it's alpha phase. 
0 waiting -


[12-Feb-21 01:06 PM] jspook16#3059
I know all dexes have that issue. But for someone new to crypto they might come in with the mindset that adex is a robinhood replacement....except no fiat to crypto

[12-Feb-21 01:10 PM] Jcharming#2693
Use this to guide your thoughts:

Solutions for AtomicDEX = all solutions the people are making in crypto. 
So if I make `charming coin` and I have an easy solution for USD<>Crypto: then AtomicDEX has an easy solution for USD<>Crypto 

it's a simple integration for a project that is successful to get a "tab" added to AtomicDEX and skin it as their own then distribute it. 
We'll help them because we can and if there is no risk to take on we'll add the tab to AtomicDEX treating (AtomicDEX) as a master agregator of all resources in our crypto environemnt. 
If we can't/there is risk then we'll promote that projects branded and skinned `jcharmingDEX` because the underlying protocol is what is actually what's important - ***Komodo DeFi Engine*** it actually doesn't matter who uses it and where.  We all benefit especially AtomicDEX users, *especially* KMD hodlers.

[12-Feb-21 02:18 PM] jspook16#3059
thats probably why. There is geo blocking that was implemented initially when they thought it was needed. They have since found out that it is not required and will be removing it. For now i think atomicdex desktop is the one without geoblocking

3. can you please go a bit into the "Liquidity pool multiplier"
4. and you also mentioned something about 1 bitcoin -> 10 bitcoins not sure what you meant, it was regarding an orderbook feature of some kind?


[15-Feb-21 10:51 AM] cipi#4502
those are simply prices fetched from external sites... it was coinpaprika, recently switched to coingecko... but that's just informative


[15-Feb-21 10:52 AM] cipi#4502
has no effect on orderbook entries


[15-Feb-21 10:53 AM] cipi#4502
if you have 1 BTC in AtomicDEX, you place eg 10 buy orders, each with a volume of 1 BTC... buy KMD for 1 BTC, buy DOGE for 1 BTC, buy LTC for 1 BTC... if one of the orders is matched, it cancels the other ones

there is a min trade amount of 0.00777 for all coins... but makers can also post their own min_trade_volume... i do this for BTC and ETH/ERC20 based on the fees... so that the txfees are at most 2-3% of the trade amount... because buying $100 of KMD and paying 100$ txfees on ETH (if buying with ETH) makes no sense for me

​"can you hold veruscoin and get rewards on the dex?"

the VRSC rewards are staking rewards, so no, because for staking you need to run a full node (sync the entire chain and run verusd)

is there any thought given to Komodo devoting resources to make sure the top ten coins y market cap are supported? I know it is usually said to be on the project to add the listing, but it seems in atomicdex's interest to always support the top 10


[15-Feb-21 11:17 AM] Mvictor#4284
Kind noob question I think, but if for example, I want to buy 1 BTC using KMD, and the first order in the order book selling side is 0,7BTC, will I automatically buy 0,3BTC from the next orders or I will be able to buy just this 0,7BTC from the first order?


[15-Feb-21 11:19 AM] KryptoNomade#1296
Are there any ressources devoted into better ledger integration, especcially with regard to atomicDEX but also KMD intrest or liquity pools.


[15-Feb-21 11:19 AM] cipi#4502
not automatically, you would need to do 2 different swaps... there are plans to make this possible though

there are some integrations in the making, but i don't know the details... Tezos and BEP20 are 2 that i know of
this is also a possibility: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ABounty
open an github issue and offer a bounty for integration... BCH has done it with their tokens


[15-Feb-21 11:22 AM] Mvictor#4284
another question is about the 5% reward, if I received 2 deposits in KMD, both above 10KDM, it's better to leave like this and claim the reward for both deposits, or consolidate into one single deposit, or it doesn't make any difference at all?

@Jcharming are you still thinking of running some sort of learning program 2nd half of the year

afaik it doesn't make a difference

That's what I think also, since it's a percentage over the value, just wanted to confirm, again thank you 🙂

[15-Feb-21 11:32 AM] fat3lvis#6079
I think the tech is great, but honestly the future userbase won't care so i would focus less on Atomic swaps, and more on the non-custodial and pure p2p nature of the dex vs UNI style markets.That may sound like we are saying the same thing, but we aren't. When fuel injection came to market, the exact nature of not needing a carburetor was irrelevant. The fuel economy and the added power were the thing. Don't sweat marketing the tech. Market the benefits in the best light possible. So sure Automic swaps will get mentioned but they can be a total black box. Effing magic.

Is there somehow a possibility to bundle atomic swaps to save fees?


[15-Feb-21 11:37 AM] cipi#4502
that would not work, because if you trade with 2 different partners, you need to send the funds to two different addresses in 2 different transactions


[15-Feb-21 11:37 AM] diamondsareforever#4055
gamechanger would be to set trailing stops on trades


[15-Feb-21 11:38 AM] cipi#4502
best way to save txfees is to use low fee coins (everything besides BTC and ETH/ERC20)

webdex is also in the making, for people who don't want to install apps... although i would advise to do so, since it's more secure than a website


[15-Feb-21 11:42 AM] diamondsareforever#4055
@cipi it is more secure, but for adoption, you're cutting out a huge part of TAM

This would be a great for adaptions, even IDO's

Komodo needs to have an apps section. Just like my android or ios device.


[15-Feb-21 11:45 AM] diamondsareforever#4055
In the apps section is where one could develop a secure connection to, say... Aave and other defi products


[15-Feb-21 11:46 AM] diamondsareforever#4055
If it can be pulled directly into the dex UI through a browser, it could push adoption


[15-Feb-21 11:46 AM] diamondsareforever#4055
whitelabeling atomicdex is a fringe use case IMO


[15-Feb-21 11:47 AM] fat3lvis#6079
So Atomicdex and dodgedex are  skins on the komodo defi-engine?


[15-Feb-21 11:47 AM] diamondsareforever#4055
Launchpad could be an app in atomicdex, where multiple platforms offering IDOs could live


[15-Feb-21 11:47 AM] diamondsareforever#4055
Think "hub". Komodo has an opportunity to consolidate


[15-Feb-21 11:48 AM] diamondsareforever#4055
polka, bsc and others need to be integrated


[15-Feb-21 11:48 AM] cipi#4502
yes, both are based on the same engine and use the same orderbook

This would be huge


[15-Feb-21 11:49 AM] fat3lvis#6079
oh wow so this whole "delisting of privacy coins" is pure theater?! love it


[15-Feb-21 11:49 AM] cipi#4502
yes, it's already possible... just list the coin/token that you want to IDO and post asks so people can pick up those asks and buy your coin

[15-Feb-21 12:00 PM] diamondsareforever#4055
serious question: Is there consideration for adding a "dapps" nav option in the UI sidebar? This would then open/install multiple dapps

I wanted to give a big thanks for the team of KMD, as an Engineer and newcomer to this world, KMD was the first one who really caught my eyes and these "tutorials" are being and are going to be incredible to broaden mine and others knowledge on this matter, so thank you for this!

I think focus on the wallet interoperability is the key to liquidity for the DEX


[15-Feb-21 12:03 PM] dtrs#0042
It would be great to have a comparison of ERC20 / QRC20 / TRC20


[15-Feb-21 12:03 PM] diamondsareforever#4055
@Jcharming you unintentionally said tendies 😆


[15-Feb-21 12:04 PM] dtrs#0042
Is it only ERC20 and QRC20 tokens that can be used for IDO?


[15-Feb-21 12:04 PM] fat3lvis#6079
Also focusing on the age of all of these features would be hugely unique. I've been using Atomicdex for over a year. That's ancient in the crypto world.


[15-Feb-21 12:06 PM] cipi#4502
UTXO coins that are compatible can be used too: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins#prerequisites-for-a-coin-to-be-compatible-with-atomicdex-api
and of course KMD smart chains, which is what i would use

Ok thanks cipi. I'd like to know in terms of performance capacities, why a KMD smart chain or why a QRC20 or why a TRC20 (based on Tron). I had the intention to deploy an ERC20 token and realized it is simply a nightmare so decided I will rather deploy on Tron.

still live @Jcharming


[15-Feb-21 12:16 PM] cipi#4502
it is a question of involved txfees... ERC20 txfees are very high, so better use something else
and then it depends on what exactly you want to do... if it's just a coin that does not need smart contracts, it does not matter that much
KMD smart chains are different compared to the other platforms, because every coin is running on his own chain, not on the KMD chain (like QRC20 tokens running on the QTUM chain or TRC20 tokens running on the TRX chain)
this means they are totally independent... and the txfees are payed in the coin, not in QTUM/TRX, so you dont't also need KMD/QTUM/TRX to make a transaction

grats guys


[15-Feb-21 12:19 PM] cipi#4502
and because KMD smart chains are independent, you can set them up as you like... set them as POW or POS or a combination of both (eg 50% POW, 50% POS)... you can also set the block reward as you like and configure everything related to it like halving times and stuff


[15-Feb-21 12:19 PM] fat3lvis#6079

[15-Feb-21 12:23 PM] dtrs#0042
Thanks for all the info. I'm definitely interested about KMD smart chain now. What about transactions per second?


[15-Feb-21 12:25 PM] cipi#4502
it only depends on how fast the blocks can be mined... so if you have 1 minute blocktime and the blocks are indeed coming every minute you can calculate how many txes that may be... but i am not sure about the block size/number of max transactions per block... for that we need to ask some other team members


[15-Feb-21 12:27 PM] fat3lvis#6079
stress tests have been north of 10,000tps with 1,000,000tps theoretically feesible I think. It's all listed somewhere. I don't remember where

[15-Feb-21 12:35 PM] TimC#3334
During the stress test I was given.... KMD, FIRO, QTUM, EMC2, NAV, VRSC and RVN


[15-Feb-21 12:35 PM] TimC#3334
when I open it v4 AtomicDex only the KMD, EMC2, VRSC and RVN are there but QTUM and NAV are now shown


[15-Feb-21 12:36 PM] TimC#3334
or it shows zero

[15-Feb-21 12:49 PM] Jcharming#2693
VPNs are the right route but we're not recommending them for obvious reasons. 
It's important to always be using a VPN for non-AtomicDEX related reasons no matter what - be sure you always are.  As a byproduct you'll never have an issue with AtomicDEX dextab  and as @ZokiZok  $ARRR commented there are existing and maintained community run forks that tend to go through the process of disabling the features that protect dev team from working on regulatory questionably fintech


[15-Feb-21 12:50 PM] TranslucentMonkey#9147
Good point, I would never use a VPN to get around regulatory issues. I will just wait for it to be approved in Canada. Thanks everyone.

I have never seen my private key... only seed phrases... are private keys never visible ?


[18-Feb-21 10:49 AM] xavi#1361
"Through bitter experience it has been found that one of the most practical storage mediums is pencil and paper. The private keys of a bitcoin wallet are encoded into random words from a dictionary which can be written down. If your hard drive crashes, you can find the paper with the seed phrase and restore the entire wallet. As seed phrases use natural language words, they have good error correction. Words written in bad handwriting can often still be read. If one or two letters are missing the word can often still be deduced. The word list that the seed phrase words are drawn from is carefully chosen so that the first four letters of each word are enough to uniquely identify it."

if i no longer exist, how can i ensure my wallet content can go to those i want to?

Could that be programable, so that if a wallet is not used for 5 years, the content automatically gets sent to a pre-set wallet?

It would be interesting to have a main wallet with several secondary ones which will be limited to spending a certain amount of crypto or freeze it from main wallet...


[18-Feb-21 11:39 AM] xavi#1361
unfortunately that can be done, BUT that needs to be done on a server you own and trust OR on the blockchain itself as far i know, but i'm not a blockchain developer, only a developer 🙂

Thanks again for another great session. I had a few questions about wallets if it isn't too late: Can I import a wallet? If so, is there a network fee for this? What thread should I be asking these kinds of questions in if this is not the right one?


[18-Feb-21 12:51 PM] Jcharming#2693
This is a great place to ask them. 
If you have a Komodo Seed you can important your wallet into AtomicDEX.

If you don't then you're advised to make an AtomicDEX wallet (it's a multicoin wallet) and then transfer your assets to that private wallet and interact with your assets using AtomicDEX.


[18-Feb-21 12:52 PM] Jcharming#2693
No fee btw for importing a wallet - transferring your assets usually has fee's associated with it from blockchain tx costs, but no fees on AtomicDEX for withdraws deposits because it's actually a private wallet you own.

It seems to@me that there is a big market hole in the WBTC unwrapping world. Adding the erc-20 WBTC to the Dex would one of the only places to swap WBTC to BTC without a centralized exchange. Am I wrong about this? I haven’t found a dex that can swap them


[20-Feb-21 11:48 AM] fat3lvis#6079
Or do much of anything with actual BTC

@PTYX any idea if we could accelerate someone creating a kBTC coin on KMD? Bounty etc? I’m still not sure if its primarily a technical limitation, or just waiting on someone to do it.


[21-Feb-21 05:14 PM] PTYX#6840
Someone to take custody of it


[21-Feb-21 05:14 PM] PTYX#6840
Build a portal to issue and redeem it. That's all


[21-Feb-21 05:14 PM] PTYX#6840
Not sure how to accelerate. I've thought of doingit myself. But my concern is building a secure enough portal. It will take some money for sure


[21-Feb-21 05:14 PM] phm87#7395
Legal work should be done to select states then know which NN would not go to jail if we use the NN


[21-Feb-21 05:15 PM] phm87#7395
PTYX : Did you do the legal research in your country ? In my country Belgium, it can be an impossible nightmare with high cost (then exit to Luxembourg)


[21-Feb-21 05:16 PM] PTYX#6840
Panama is pretty easy


[21-Feb-21 05:16 PM] PTYX#6840
We wouldn't offer the services inside Panama and avoid alot of legal issues as well as taxes


[21-Feb-21 05:16 PM] tolken#2655
Just goes over my head I guess. Doesn’t verus take in native crypto, allow conversions through its AMM etc? I’m not clear why any direct custody is ever necessary. More research I guess.


[21-Feb-21 05:16 PM] phm87#7395
there will still be a risk that you don't give me back my KMD when I give you the kKMD


[21-Feb-21 05:17 PM] PTYX#6840
It's definitely trust based


[21-Feb-21 05:17 PM] PTYX#6840
Like WBTC


[21-Feb-21 05:17 PM] phm87#7395
I'd prefer something decentralized, a smartcontract, a custom consensus


[21-Feb-21 05:17 PM] phm87#7395
Did you look at what zcash did ? They were added to renBTC/ren nodes


[21-Feb-21 05:17 PM] PTYX#6840
Me too


[21-Feb-21 05:18 PM] phm87#7395
we could use the infra of ren nodes


[21-Feb-21 05:18 PM] PTYX#6840
No i haven't


[21-Feb-21 05:18 PM] PTYX#6840
I'll take a look


[21-Feb-21 05:19 PM] Meyse#0952
The bridge to vETH (on Verus) will be totally decentralized, and so not based on trust. How the BTC bridge will function I also don't know, I do think the goal is to be totally trustless as well


[21-Feb-21 05:24 PM] phm87#7395
it was added in several of their repositories, there was some news about it but I skipped the news and I had a look at the code but I don't know solidity. I began to hodl KETH to be able to test things on Ethereum but I'm more than noob in eth
<https://github.com/renproject/bridge/search?q=zec>
<https://github.com/renproject/darknode-sol/search?q=zec>
I didn't understand what need to be changed when I looked at the commit history (chaostnet commit was huge). I think that a reliable KMDBTC price source is needed on ethereum (so we need to pay another smartcontract to write prices in eth blockchain as I understood)


[21-Feb-21 05:26 PM] phm87#7395
So if I build a price source on testnet ethereum, maybe I can test something but we need to talk (and pay ?) ren guys. Maybe it could be easier to use our beloved NN and another solution (Alright had a look at tBTC)


[21-Feb-21 05:36 PM] cipi#4502
if you launch an algorithmic stablecoin (backed by other crypto, like KMD, not real USD in a bank) then probably there are no legal issues at all, are there?

Recently, the big boss said on the news that Mastercard will work to help people to have more access to cryptocurrencies/bitcoin and with more protection


[21-Feb-21 06:14 PM] phm87#7395
it was in reuters, I can find the news but I didn't hear of a new product yet about crypto

Paypal and VISA already bought some big companies in cryptoland, Mastercard didn't bought any yet, I hope that they will buy some crypto companies (tech, OTC, crypto payment processor)


[21-Feb-21 06:15 PM] actionslacks#4072
how many bitcoins? dm me


[21-Feb-21 06:16 PM] actionslacks#4072
I'll be the next pondsea


[21-Feb-21 06:16 PM] phm87#7395
lol, I think that MC owns 0 BTC now, that's sad but I didn't check in official papers, maybe they own some but not much


[21-Feb-21 06:16 PM] actionslacks#4072
take my money, to help the co,,unity


[21-Feb-21 06:17 PM] actionslacks#4072
so negative interest? Is that a personal mission?


[21-Feb-21 06:17 PM] phm87#7395
yes but it doesn't work until now


[21-Feb-21 06:17 PM] phm87#7395
and the coin who used such tech didn't perform well in price


[21-Feb-21 06:17 PM] phm87#7395
so maybe the idea is not good


[21-Feb-21 06:17 PM] actionslacks#4072
thats a bad metric


[21-Feb-21 06:18 PM] phm87#7395
algorithmic stablecoin already exists and things like AMPL


[21-Feb-21 06:18 PM] actionslacks#4072
you're doing the crypto thing all wrong


[21-Feb-21 06:19 PM] phm87#7395
But yes, maybe we'll sell very expensive satoshis to MC one day (1 sat per cent ?)


[21-Feb-21 06:19 PM] phm87#7395
and very very expensive KMD


[21-Feb-21 06:20 PM] actionslacks#4072
It's crypto, mc could throw 10 mil at a self deflationary contract without batting an eye


[21-Feb-21 06:20 PM] actionslacks#4072
why haven't they?


[21-Feb-21 06:21 PM] phm87#7395
yes, they are already paying dozen of guys for their own blockchain and their plan is to enhance the buying of BTC using MC cards as I understood


[21-Feb-21 06:21 PM] actionslacks#4072
is leto right?


[21-Feb-21 06:22 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Do we need a mastercard connect


[21-Feb-21 06:22 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239

[21-Feb-21 06:22 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239

[21-Feb-21 06:22 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
All I know is he does automation and he got their tx/s much much higher


[21-Feb-21 06:22 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
and kept getting promoted


[21-Feb-21 06:23 PM] phm87#7395
I don't know how to plug KMD into it. I don't work on mastercard connect but I heard about it. And maybe we'd need a licence to do this

Branding dex case study sounds cool... am sure plenty of platforms would want to join strengths ....


[22-Feb-21 11:25 AM] Jcharming#2693
Agreed it's just one of those things that just makes sense.  If there is a project that has a wallet with a DEX then their wallet is out of date.  Their users could have DEX trading possibilities which makes their supply more available for trading which means more coins that are being traded - volume increase = price action and everything else.  Basic clear win for projects to have and support their own individual communities liquidity - Komodo continuing to lay the groundwork

[22-Feb-21 11:44 AM] Lexbaba#3219
I am sure these ideas have been mentioned by others or the may be completely impractical but I thought i should put it out there.  Some ways to gain new users could be the following: 1) have a komodo dex extension on browsers like metamask, 2) have communication integration like the Zillica wallet on Telegram, 3) Have direct integration here on Discord so that swaps can be made by all discord users ... each user name may have to then be linked with a Komodo public key to be able to send and receive coins. 4)  The approach of engaging with other projects that do not have a wallet or wallet with DEX functionality could be an endeavour all on its own.  5) develop yield capacity on all the coins one holds in their wallet. This could be a great selling point as everybody wants to make yield on the coins they are holding in their wallets ...

what's beautiful is that the team build the atomicdex gui on flutter. that means it's compatible with mobile, desktop, and browsers.


[22-Feb-21 12:11 PM] PTYX#6840
i'm not 100% sure what's the timeframe on the webdex but i know @ca333 and the dev team have plans for it. one thing that would be needed in my point of view is a sort of relay function for the webdex and even let's say a discord-bot-dex. basically meaning that a user can set and order and forget. right now you need the client running in the background for swaps to complete.

[22-Feb-21 12:12 PM] PTYX#6840
the client signs each transaction as it's going through the swap so we'd need to solve that.

yes webdex is coming and in the works

@Jcharming hi. i am talking with  PTYX on telegram. And we have questions about KMD marketing plans. He said that i talked with marketing team. They have a plan. We will see it very shortly. But he didn't explain us on there. He said you can ask them on discord. What is your plan in your mind? We believe in Kmd and want to see New marketing News. And why isnt there any news on coinmarketcal.com about atomicdex?


[26-Feb-21 06:57 AM] unalsengun#0892
Thanks so much


[26-Feb-21 07:57 AM] Jcharming#2693
will discuss more about this after feb is over for coinmarketcal blockfolio and various outreach sites as this is the march sprint goals now that we have the ability to fill the space we make. 

For today https://discord.com/channels/412898016371015680/814886401631715328/814888257850048512

This is infos you can help share on Telegram about the marketing news - thank you for your help it's taking all of us to wake Komodo dragon and ride it to the moon.


[26-Feb-21 03:01 PM] unalsengun#0892
As kmd investors, we really need this.  I think kmd cannot do enough advertising and marketing.  Otherwise, with such a powerful project, a solid advertised coin should have been valued at least ten times.  yes, we invest in this technology, we think of the future, but seeing the value we give as investors relieves us psychologically.

Ok so how do we solve the problem of having to use Uniswap to get the price of our token on coingeko so it will be tracked on atomicdex.


[11-Mar-21 09:01 AM] Roger#1320
I am thinking that if I was to run a IDO on Atomicdex  I would still need to set up on another DEX to get the price tracked on Atomicdex


[11-Mar-21 09:06 AM] gcharang#6833
we are in the process of adding Atomicdex to coinpaprica and coingecko. this problem should be solved then


[11-Mar-21 09:07 AM] Roger#1320
Cool thanks for that..

@Community Contributor 
Interest meeting happening now for those looking for clear paths to help get Komodo active and making noise across the social media and marketing landscape. 

If you've ever commented on seeing a need for Komodo to be somewhere that it's not this is the designated time for you.

No idea what I can do but I am willing to develop into something maybe


[11-Mar-21 10:24 AM] Jurjen#9294
It is a small but quality platform. And messages are decentralized by ipfs, and signed by ethereum wallet


[11-Mar-21 10:25 AM] Jcharming#2693
That's great do you have a platform you like to most use or do you just enjoy producing content?  Tell me a little about it


[11-Mar-21 10:25 AM] Jurjen#9294

Hey, is this something like Theta which will replace YT in the new system with decentralization, so decentralized SM platforms will presumably do the same with the likes of FB, Twitter?

[11-Mar-21 10:37 AM] animus#8016
YES! That's good to know! Do have this strong sense that Theta and KMD could be fast friends in the new system, surrounded by community support (totally decentralized, open source!)! Oh, but I don't know if I'm qualified to help since I'm more in the research of things (RoT!). But if I could help in any way, I will. You guys have been quite busy pumping your presence in SM which I think is a great strategy! Theta's grinding theirs too, albeit more BTS (getting more entertainment outlets, i.e. studios, production co.s, to sign up), I think.

Any new news that could affect the price?  new project?  new breakthrough?  something new for marketing???


[11-Mar-21 02:02 PM] ejuliano#8606
to get a sense of the base line, what were the previous pieces of news that stand out for you, that were good for price?


[11-Mar-21 02:04 PM] unalsengun#0892
Atomicdex was good New. Due to the downtrend of BTC, it could not show the necessary effect on the price.


[11-Mar-21 02:06 PM] unalsengun#0892
i joined kmd when it is 0.6 i belive in thecnology of kmd but people want to see price performance too.


[11-Mar-21 02:06 PM] ejuliano#8606
on a fundamental level, upcoming news will be the growth of the komodo ecosystem;  direct and indirect interoperability;
then, komodo will continue to develop on the tech it has already put into place, those are potentially farther away, since atomic dex and the interoperability play will be continuing for months... June will have a climactic moment with the VIrtual conference.


[11-Mar-21 02:09 PM] ejuliano#8606
growth of komodo ecosystem directly is from projects that use or are related to komodo - Marmara, Pirate, Verus, CryptoCollider, Tokel, CHIPS, and all the others.;
there has been rumored at some point some news that will release about business partnership (i can't remember their name now, but anyway, there will be others too, i'm sure of that)


[11-Mar-21 02:09 PM] ejuliano#8606
indirectly is the interoperability with other communities/projects - recent examples are DOGE -->  DogeDEX


[11-Mar-21 02:10 PM] ejuliano#8606
and NEM will use Komodo/DEX


[11-Mar-21 02:17 PM] ejuliano#8606
the more i understand it, i realize; Linux is huge, but nobody really knows about it, maybe 20% know about it;
yet, it is used quite a lot, so, it is very powerful and influential while not being required to be known or cared about too much by the masses;
similar thing can happen with Komodo Platform


[11-Mar-21 02:20 PM] ejuliano#8606
in terms of KMD/BTC price, i wonder what long term charts will look like for successful long-lived cryptos, like a 10 year worth of data in a chart;
short term, KMD will undoubtedly pop up higher;
what is reasonable Satoshi level for bull market highs KMD/BTC for2021/2022?
in KMD/USD it will surely rise, but, I guess it depends your time frame and your desired price targets


[11-Mar-21 02:24 PM] unalsengun#0892
Frankly, Komodo is rebelling against the system.  new breakthroughs cannot find a response in the current order because of this rebellion.  In fact, a little gift, a little stronger advertisement, maybe airdrop, maybe coin burning ... you know, investors are waiting for things that will increase interaction.  I believe in the power of the bedside table, but this is not reflected in the price.  As Komodo investors, we want to feel good.  Even with airdrops, uniswap made people own cars.  Komodo has only increased 100% in 2 months.  You know, when investors see these movements in the market, they stay away from kmd.


[11-Mar-21 02:26 PM] ejuliano#8606
you gotta love crypto, where it makes sense to say it "has only increased 100% in 2 months"


[11-Mar-21 02:27 PM] ejuliano#8606
are you aware of DogeDEX?

Just 4 dollars would make me feel safe


[11-Mar-21 02:27 PM] ejuliano#8606
it is creating a lot of user interaction ----->>> user interaction


[11-Mar-21 02:28 PM] ejuliano#8606
don't worry about 4$, it's coming, depending on your time frame;  again though, if you want to feel safe, in crypto, hold higher proportion of investments in BTC


[11-Mar-21 02:29 PM] ejuliano#8606
hopefully users feel good taking their Komodo and swapping it on AtomicDEX; or DogeDEX;

Of course we love and trust crypto and the Komodo system.  However, as an investor, there is 600% rising chz even in a week in the market, while kmd, which has only made 100% for 2 months, makes us sad.  We are waiting for new things in the marketing part.


[11-Mar-21 02:32 PM] ejuliano#8606
if you're looking for the popular coins, like ADA BNB DOT LINK ETH,....  Komodo is not that right now; 
there will be one or two huge green candles up in price; who knows when, ... it will probably be along with QTUM, ICX, and all the other altcoins that are going to be caught in an altcoin mania


[11-Mar-21 02:32 PM] unalsengun#0892
These levels could be a long time frustration for BTC if a possible bear season comes.  Therefore, it makes sense to turn to other coins that are weaker against BTC.  and my biggest investment is in kmd, where I trust its technology.


[11-Mar-21 02:34 PM] ejuliano#8606
look at the QTUM chart, the ICX chart, and many other altcoins;  long term -- monthly, weekly charts, priced in BTC
compare it to KMD charts
altcoins will likely have a bull market against BTC at some point


[11-Mar-21 02:35 PM] unalsengun#0892
So when will Komodo be able to make a name for itself? Maybe marketing team must be mide creative.

Komodo continues to make a name for itself;
haev you listened to the Thursday Townhall stream from earlier today?


[11-Mar-21 02:36 PM] ejuliano#8606
it has some evidence Komodo doing this


[11-Mar-21 02:36 PM] unalsengun#0892
Yes but everyone wait 100-300k for BTC and dominance is rising again...

yes, so, if BTC is going to go up to 100k, and you are watching KMD/USD, then it will probably also be going up;
if you're watching KMD/BTC, you need a longer time frame, maybe 1-2 years, to be convinced that we're on an uptrend

if you're ok with reading/writing, there are also the articles that are written about what is happening for Komodo -- see the official-news channel;
also you can look in the marketing community and see what some things are happening on social media like twitter, and other discussions happening about the marketing and komodo awareness


[11-Mar-21 02:43 PM] unalsengun#0892
Frankly, there is not much interesting for the investor.  The most important thing for us seems to be to pray for Elon Musk's attention.  but I still do not know airdrop, coin burning etc.  I am obsessed with the issue that such popular breakthroughs have not been made.  Is it too difficult to do something popular for the big kmd team?  to attract investor interest.


[11-Mar-21 03:00 PM] ejuliano#8606
oh i completely forgot to say:
this is all about market psychology
crypto market psychology is insane
if you understand that, your heart will feel better about your KMD
or, if you want more quick money, you need to understand the market greed & fear;
also, at this point, where is smart money looking;
it's charts that have not yet pumped like THETA or ADA


[11-Mar-21 03:02 PM] ejuliano#8606
also, BTC will dominate everyone, so, make sure you're comfortable with what you're holding on to.  it's better for your health that way -->  over-stress is unhealthy, it has a bad effect on your systems over the long term


[11-Mar-21 03:10 PM] PTYX#6840
obviously market price is important for us but more important is the sustainability of the project. We need to ensure revenue sources to keep the project moving and price action will follow. KMD is a very small project in terms of community when compared to other projects that launched in the past years. We are one of the old projects that came from the ICO times and if you look at the ICO, we raised a very small amount. We've accomplished more than most with very little resources.


[11-Mar-21 03:13 PM] unalsengun#0892
There is a very good idiom in Turkish for this situation, but I cannot explain it in English.


[11-Mar-21 03:13 PM] unalsengun#0892
🙂


[11-Mar-21 03:14 PM] unalsengun#0892
Should we get something out of this situation now that seems to be happening only with the resources available?  It seems like it would be a dream to expect something about the price in the near future ...


[11-Mar-21 03:22 PM] PTYX#6840
Pushing the price on any coin happens from either demand for the coin or hype.


[11-Mar-21 03:22 PM] PTYX#6840
To create demand for Komodo we need to design systems around that. This conversation is already happening but will take time. Creating hype isn't really sustainable


[11-Mar-21 03:24 PM] PTYX#6840
That's the reality. KMD was designed for freedom which didn't really take into account making a demand for the coin. Even though it has utility, it has no high demand. That's a conversation that we are having within the team and are finding ways to create demand. This isn't gonna happen overnight


[11-Mar-21 03:43 PM] PTYX#6840

[11-Mar-21 04:28 PM] Mark81#4505
@Deleted User  i hope you dont fomo back in markets also when everything is soaring. its all about keeping yourself touched to markets and studying it and making small gains everyday so that you can sleep without it coming to your dreams. and same goes to even then when there's bear market and things doesn't go your way you thinked it in begin.


[11-Mar-21 05:25 PM] Jhannon#3708
It's interesting and @ptyx is very right, and to tap. Into that demand a few things are required.

Firstly, more folks need to know about and see the value of KMD.

So a marketing and promo engage  long term is necessary however this needs to be driven by numbers for the buyers and sellers.

Everyone in the market who joined in the last year or two, did this for profits.

KMD requires partnerships, community members and hodlers who can leverage their networks to create network effects for KMD as was achieved with BT. And ETH. Eth harnessed its network effects through bankers and given that BTC held the lead naturally they bought it. The aimed to surpass btc many times, with Eth as the BTC killer this did not happen thankfully.


[11-Mar-21 05:25 PM] Jhannon#3708
Kmd requires a lot more valuable engagements. And it takes a community supporting a sma team.


[11-Mar-21 05:26 PM] Jhannon#3708
The twitter community is millions of people their team isn't even 1 million employees.


[11-Mar-21 05:26 PM] Jhannon#3708
Sorry for the long msg most of this is common sense.


[11-Mar-21 05:29 PM] Jhannon#3708
I would like to work with KMD and bring my networks and the networks of my contacts to KMD.

One of my contacts a neighbor, recently bought £20k  of One (harmony coin) could have been better spent here. Got her to move 25 percent into kmd and soon.


[11-Mar-21 05:29 PM] Jhannon#3708
She has been happy for the growth and since asked for more insight and have read a tone in KMD. Also got her to invest in Zel  which is soong going to be Flux.

I hope that I am not the addressee of this answer.  It is a person called adverb.  Because I trust the commode and its technology, I have long-term and large purchases, I just want to see it more valuable in terms of price.  I wrote to talk about what we can do to find solutions for this because I do not understand the publications because my English is not good.

I used Gimp, a visual editing tool on my own PC, a Wordpress plugin called Web Stories By Google and Wordpress CMS, along with hosting for a Wordpress platform. I think one of these could be created for any web page online as a summery teaser using screen shots with most of the work already done on the site its self. It could be used to create link juice as part of a linking network because I think the evil ones are planning on giving prominence to these in search results if they are SEO'd correctly.

"Declaration of Independence

We the asset holders hereby declare our independence from any single blockchain.

An open and jointly developed specification on cross chain atomic asset transfers will be developed. Any current or future blockchain is invited to join.

Each blockchain will need to not only promise protections for asset holder interests, they need to live up to them. Otherwise, all the assets will simply move to blockchains that do.

Additionally, once assets become mobile, the different blockchains will start to differentiate themselves with better features for the assets. Better liquidity, better fees, more functions.

This ability for the asset holder to choose where their assets reside is the only protection from the tyranny of the hardfork.

Traditional companies trade on multiple exchanges, it is time for decentralized assets to distribute the blockchains they exist on. Maintaining a constant total number of assets issued across all blockchains will allow maintaining a fixed total, but only if each participating blockchain follows strict rules on asset issuance.

The reality is that everything in crypto trades against BTC. One of the conditions for cross chain assets is the ability to trade directly against BTC, preferably native BTC and not a derivative. I will be working on a reference implementation as a first draft and look forward to collaborate with all other asset oriented projects.

This is an interop standards effort and it needs to be blockchain agnostic and asset centric.

James

P.S. I am not asking for any funds or investments."https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1372879.0

@Cryptolord  I found that you didn't tell me it was an affiliate tracking link that should have been declared as a self interest. I can do exactly as I want until I can't, just like you did with an undisclosed tracking link. You tell me about a potential decentralized search engine that could potentially  protect peoples privacy whilst at the same time not disclosing a tracking link, it does not give out a good impression.

When newcomers (out of komodo discord) ask me what is komodo, I talk about dPoW, smartchains, ARRR, komodo active user rewards, ... I share few links to docs, there are some awesome gists about kmd but is there an official good list of features ? There was an unofficial video website about dpow.
I will schedule a call later to talk about ideas. I already text chat a lot but no call yet (beers with old notaries is lisbon were not with team).
Thank you

That's ok I think the translate came across ok, thanks for coming by and getting in touch with slyris and us - let me give some thought to what we can find to do together that might also help you on your path to learn more 

You can sync with @paco who is helping to head up some edu sources for coding and is looking for people to add to that group 

keep coming back to these community interest meetings we'll find something : )

ok that's cool, i'm holding back for paco

I've been following the komodo and arrr project since 2017, so I pretty much know what I'm getting into 😉

I would love to apply for the NN, knowing that I have friends who already do it for you,

I am motivated and I didn't really have the time to invest in komodo before 😉

good bye and thank you

Yeah, glad you mentioned it, just tried another image, it was too large, reduced it, too large, reduced it again, too large, provides no indication of size limits, probably won't be using it again as image hosting, too much guess work. Thanks.

Hello everyone
this is the first time that I propose to be a candidate for the election of notary node

I am DrKush a linuxian who loves sharing and open source and I am a teacher in web and mobile development and network basics! I love nodejs, vuejs, and mongoDB to work with, but also practice others! I have been following komodo since 2017, but until today I did not have the time to really invest myself in it and I see its elections as a real chance for me.

I have met a few people from the komodo ecosystem who are valued people for me, I really like the ambitions of the communities that pass in front of the institutions. Free and free again! I'm also a fan of JL777's manifesto about komodo.

I promise that if I am elected, I will do my best to help the komodo project within the limits of my skills of course, but I love to learn, that's why I am starting the language rust!

I am a candidate for the notary node of 2021!

I thank my traductor gogole to facilitate communication with you, if you have any questions, thank you for writing them, because I hardly speak English.
```

That was very cool to listen in on. Everyone is deserving and those voting have an extremely difficult decision. 

In my opinion, the integration of dpow and the Monero ecosystem will be one of the most important advancements in the crypto space.

not at all ! I'm just starting and it will look more like a tutorial than a non-production update, moreover I was well notified that I should favor RUST for my back but currently I'm doing nodejs so I'm getting to know the ecosystem with what I know,
And I would switch to rust after the NN elections because it takes me time in addition to my personal life 😅


[14-Apr-21 01:41 PM] 𝓓𝓻 𝓚𝓾𝓼𝓱 |🦄| Komodian#3853

most people don't like running native mode (need to download blockchain data, must backup wallet.dat file after every outgoing txn to be extremely safe). the js rpc wrapper I created is a simple tool that can help js apps communicate with the komodo daemon. but, users won't like it very much to use stuff if it can only be run on desktop using native mode. in my experience,most regular users like it if the tech they are using comes along in a shiny website or a mobile app.  somewhat tech savvy users are fine with desktop apps, but they don't want to think too much about daily backups, let alone backup after every txn.


[15-Apr-21 02:27 AM] 𝓓𝓻 𝓚𝓾𝓼𝓱 |🦄| Komodian#3853
and why not create the KLang at this time lol
But hey, I'm not there at all,

What I find super cool with Quasar is that it's a PWA that uses cordova and electron, can be slower than a C application for purists, but very practical to be available on all formats (all mobile, all desktop, and website) I admit that quasar is my favorite tool at the moment!

I would only miss one API to realize in RUST and I would be good at the tech level !

you can use your discord login (if you're using web) to connect & comment.

early days, but including all verus tech, atomic dex, binance smart chain stuff and when #open-food-chain is released open source, that as well.

the easiest way to get setup is by using webworker's mmtools and if you want to automate order placing, you can use cipi's mpm which is included

We have to try it ourselves too to understand web stories and how we can use them, and how they work


[29-Apr-21 10:17 AM] Nev#5914
There is potentially a lot of uses for these things I think, like short teasers to draw people in, especially if targeted at the right keywords.

The foundational idea for Komodo Platform was born on February 21, 2016, when James ‘jl777’ Lee published his Declaration of Independence:
 

We the asset holders hereby declare our independence from any single blockchain.

An open and jointly developed specification on cross-chain atomic asset transfers will be developed. Any current or future blockchain is invited to join. 

Each blockchain will need to not only promise protections for asset holder interests, they need to live up to them. Otherwise, all the assets will simply move to blockchains that do.….

This is an interop standards effort and it needs to be blockchain agnostic and asset centric.

I would like to experiment this on my app 😉

so for kmd reward it has to be in dex, not rewards on binanck


[12-May-21 10:36 AM] laras#4981
and utxo, IN, have to be 10 minimal all the time???


[12-May-21 10:36 AM] laras#4981
I really like the dex, atomicdex, but for myself i still have to check and find out if it is , and can be considered safe to store funds on.


[12-May-21 10:37 AM] laras#4981
The technical says yes, safu, own private keys but i like to double check and also do the investigation.


[12-May-21 10:37 AM] laras#4981
Besides the atomicdex for example , what is the best place to store your kmd then?


[12-May-21 10:41 AM] Nev#5914
More appropriate to  talk-general not roundtable.

depends on community performance. We can talk to each other only for so long alone, before we hit the next meeting. But I would say it can go from 30 minutes to an hour, as we Have Thursday Townhall at 17 PM UTC, but Wednesday 12 PM UTC might go longer, if people are active, or we have guests

Hello✌ regarding the thursday townhall i want to discuss the following:

I think we have to solve 2 challenges. Challenge 1 is to increase the use of adex and challenge 2 is the increase of kmd demand. If we can solve both problems i think this could be a milestone for kmd.

Now my Question is if there are possible solutions for this challenges and if yes, which ones and which time can we expect it?

Up Only: How AtomicDEX Uptime Compares to Centralized Exchanges
Centralized exchanges have notoriously been known to break down due to increased user activity. Solutions like AtomicDEX offer an alternative for traders and hodlers alike.

[20-May-21 09:43 AM] Doink#4797
Many people complain about ease of use of AtomicDEX when they first try it, are there any plans to release an updated video walkthrough with the latest features?

OR - even better - build an integrated "Tutorial" to walk new users through the process of making a swap and explains how it works as you do it

It is quite a bit simpler than Bisq, which is good. Bisq tends to keep users away with lacking ease of use, even when it is one of the only exchanges supporting a coin. 

AtomicDEX did a great job of giving a fairly “traditional” feel, as far as exchanges go. However, I agree that some how-to explainers might be useful for the less tech-savvy.

Im sure exchange listings are mostly out of the teams control, but i would contribute to a "listing fund" to help if that was necessary. 

It's also quite possible that staying the course and attracting value and users will just naturally force those exchanges to list $kmd, but this could take years.

Dank meme refers to viral internet content that, due to overuse or passing trends, has lost its value or currency. It can also refer to exceptionally unique or odd memes.

I don't do mainstream anything, no TV, films, radio, books, all mostly rubbish made for the narrative they want you to believe. I will probably be living in the wilderness quite soon.

@Artakush  thanks for the link about permaculture.  Here we call it glam camp 🏕 basically living off the land as much as possible.  Rewilding and eco-theology go hand in hand.  This includes learning from the abundance.  How does this work with the Metaverse?  By not excluding technology from the mix.  Just because we live a long way away from people doesn’t mean we don’t want to interact with culture and the arts.  I love that the Louvre went on-line for example.

Sorry but my mic is too far away to be heard, but I think it is all about WASM.  "ca333 — 05/27/2021
yes, web-environment can be compared to the operating system of the future. Lots of usecases will run native in the web-browser as it makes tech truly platform agnostic. In such era even my TV or coffee-machine can run ADEX or any other software. It is one of many reasons why we picked this path and did this technology stack choice - and in few years you will see very few endusers still use Desktop PCs or Laptops and numbers be stagnating - unless you are a crypto-geek or core-dev or so won't use it. i.e. average person will run mobile or hybrid devices. Few years down the road will see 90% or more of global web-access happen through mobile end-devices. Many native (d)applications will migrate from native OS specific software to platform-agnostic and OS-independent web-application - WASM is likely just beginning of this shift. Really, imagine web-browser/environment to become OS environment of the future."

I like the sketches they look great and convey ideas, although they are a bit cliche, if you put modern figures, modern buildings in the images they would look like many other images but... I think that is a good thing because although they are quite familiar they not the same as many run of the mill images so are not too far out of other peoples experience but far enough to be fresh, new. That I think is a great move, nice work.  A mash up I made https://i.postimg.cc/HLM0ZtMs/Tell-You-A-Story.png

What are we looking at? The above images

an effort to upgrade Komodo website layout. We are migrating to a new framework our webdev team (@gcharang) found that allows us to build new pages quickly. We have to migrate all pages from current website to the new website, and this also gives us a chance to update it in a more fundamental way.

Jack has been tackling this aspect for few weeks now and will be joining our weekly hangouts this week to discuss what he is up to in greater detail.

At the same time @808 and @ramonster42 are working towards new visual direction that we showcased on last weeks hangouts. You can read a summary and watch the recording here: https://forum.komodoplatform.com/t/komodo-creative-content-open-discussion/352

Komodo Creative Content | Open Discussion
How can we put the Komodo message out there in a creative way? We need a combination of visuals with clever narratives to have attention-grabbing content that is easy to understand.  Here’s my analysis of where we are at:   We are not able to catch people’s attention with memorable and easily shared content. The current design style is too gener...

I am happy that I have caught up with the direction after getting to see that video with Raymond and Audo discussing ideas. It was good and I like the direction things are going. I can't help thinking that Raymond has got quite a task on his hands since he had no clear definition at the time of putting concepts together. I know from experience how difficult it can be. Thanks.


[16-Jun-21 05:09 AM] Nev#5914
Really like the latest ideas being revealed as well.

I have already been playing around with a video like what you are describing.


[16-Jun-21 05:15 AM] Nev#5914
I did not have good images to use so I did a bit with what I had and edited them myself with my own ideas.


[16-Jun-21 05:17 AM] Artakush#4285
cool, could you share that with us?


[16-Jun-21 05:19 AM] Nev#5914
Not at this point because I have not actually made the video but have been trying to come up with dialogue and making all the frames for animation.


[16-Jun-21 05:19 AM] Artakush#4285
awesome, would you like to share the monologue with me? could help bouncing ideas


[16-Jun-21 05:20 AM] Nev#5914
Now I have a better understanding it will help me push forward.


[16-Jun-21 05:21 AM] Nev#5914
This was/is my latest idea. That walk up the mountain was just a bit strenuous and as we crossed the last ridge it came into view, as Bog said, "it's a massive chunk of iron." Now we are getting closer it seems to be coming to life with a glow that comes from the center ring. Intriguing, I wonder what it actually is?  I think it's a gateway, a way into something else but what, I do not know? It seems to be compelling us towards it but I feel no unease.


[16-Jun-21 05:23 AM] Nev#5914
Please don't tell me to go negative on meta-verse because you will end up with a real horror show, ha, ha.

[16-Jun-21 05:27 AM] Nev#5914
If the point is to promote Komodo then could we have a character like Kom - Odo.


[16-Jun-21 05:29 AM] Nev#5914
Kom seem like a good name, I like it, reminds my of Crom from Conan.


[16-Jun-21 05:30 AM] Nev#5914
Crom is a god in Conan story's.


[16-Jun-21 05:30 AM] Nev#5914
It might be Krom though my spellings not good.


[16-Jun-21 05:31 AM] Nev#5914

what about you write out some ideas on doc, we could check it out tomorrow and add to our narrative

I don't know what you mean on doc, I have a problem with joining web site any of them including KOMODO, sorry.

@Deleted User  i muted you for the presentation we are recording 😉


[17-Jun-21 08:14 AM] Regnar#6164
@Artakush any idea about adding the Komodo blockchain, dPoW, interoperability "Demos" to the actual Komodo page instead of redirecting to Zogs? I think those Demos are really excellent and unique. Additionally we should create an AtomicDEX demo in the same style


[17-Jun-21 08:15 AM] Artakush#4285
what do you mean by Zogs? 😅  What exactly you mean by Demos? Sorry not that tech savvy here 🙆‍♂️

Ok, so The actual demo uniqness is way better than the first window


[17-Jun-21 08:19 AM] Artakush#4285
press demo, go to demo


[17-Jun-21 08:19 AM] Regnar#6164
That's why I really like the Demos @Jcharming They explain so much more in a visual way

"centralized" isn't a bad thing to most people

Daybreak is on the right track for sure.


[17-Jun-21 08:45 AM] Regnar#6164
it isn't considered a negative thing to have a centralized process. What is somewhat universally negative is consolidation of power, at the expense of many for the benefit of few.


[17-Jun-21 08:46 AM] Regnar#6164
The only people I can imagine who don't see that as bad are those who have the power lol

Cool, I was wondering what it might look like with the orbs represented as BTC, KMD, ETH?


[18-Jun-21 06:14 AM] daybreak#8641
I was thinking the orbs could be the different communities like THC, Pirate, etc.  A third use could be the Komodo Platform options: wallet, AtomicDEX, etc.  the mind just wanders with the possibilities…

Let's use #🗣┃marketing because any channel we make is likely to get filled with chat and the same issue will occur - however go ahead and ping @Jcharming when you submit these ideas as I've been developing a project managment tool for dealing with all the information collection issues and I'll go ahead and add it to an idea board that we can follow up with more easily especially with the community contributors that @Artakush and @Audo have been in contact with 👍

Shared on the townhall that AtomicDEX was given as a reason which it was eluded to was being seen as a maturing and serious competitor in the exchange space.  

And to follow up this is a consequence of centralized exchanges


[19-Jun-21 09:38 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if they **_really_** delisted even having AtomicDEX as one of the reason, we are accomplishing our mission to make a true decentralised exchange which CEXs are noticing can actually take good chunk of their earning portion, as well as the govt pressure on trying to suppress privacy tech, is also solid signal that how much this privacy tech, tools and utilities are needed. 🙂

I'd like to point something else out. (And Im not 100% sure on this)....but the delisting happened at the same time as the hard fork. And the hard fork introduced z atomic swaps (at least at the CLI level from what I understand). So if this is true.... it would support the idea that we got delisted because of the power of atomic swaps on KMD.

It's where the opportunity is.  And although we're not abandoning the smartchains we want to be sure to communicate what is the priority.

I dont know if this was mention but are there updates on the LPs for ADEX?


[19-Jun-21 10:04 AM] Jcharming#2693
Be sure to send new people and anyone that has concern over the UpBIT topic towards the Half Year Update coming up at the end of the month. 
This is very important to take the energy and send it somewhere - send it here. 
@everyone come and bring everyone else you can get this communication to as many as you are able for the next half of year of Komodo pushing.

I faked the panning with image editing software and animation, it's all animation really, if there is any lighting change then that was by accident, I don't think I messed with lighting.

I just realized you might be talking about the effect I tried to put into the center of the Komodo logo to make it look like it was glowing from the inside. Yes I did put that into the image and yes it could be described as lighting but it is how individuals think individually. Sorry I didn't think of it as light, ha, ha, it was a glow to me in my little brain. Thanks.


[20-Jun-21 05:15 AM] EurekaJohn#2094
Yes!  That's what I was talking about.  I was thinking about a couple of tools in After Effects that could do that, but I was trying to figure out how you did it on your end. Either way, it looks cool.

I bet that everybody tries to secure their privacy, time, and energy that they give out to people. I bet and I know that there are plenty trolls, scammers you name it. People trying to use you and your resources. Our as community managers job is to get connected with community more. See if we can help them develop or execute their ideas. To keep track of all the meetups with contributors we had to have something where we can track when is the next meetup, as in calendly we put our busy times and leave open spaces where we can have a call with any of you. I guess to ask to do that is not that much in exchange to one on one time with the team. 👌


[23-Jun-21 04:47 AM] Nev#5914
Yip I understand that but as you can see two people are not happy with it how many more do you see in support of it beside you and you don't count because you really are part of a conspiracy, you and Audo have your own private little meetings, planing what you are going to do and I am not accusing you of any malpractice but that is how it is.100%


[23-Jun-21 04:47 AM] Artakush#4285
So what do think happens in our "private little"meetings?

I don't

I know what we do


[23-Jun-21 04:49 AM] Artakush#4285
we do have roadmap and things we must prepare for information to transpire into the community. Soime things we can say cause they are not confirmed 100%, as soon as they do, you see them in Official news or community news.


[23-Jun-21 04:50 AM] Nev#5914
Sorry but I didn't you just provoked me.


[23-Jun-21 04:50 AM] Artakush#4285
these private meetups are for us to prepare the information for community or think of what we can offer or need to discuss with community

How can we put the Komodo message out there in a creative way? We need a combination of visuals with clever narratives to have attention-grabbing content that is easy to understand.  Here’s my analysis of where we are at:   We are not able to catch people’s attention with memorable and easily shared content. The current design style is too gener...

The team, meaning you lot give a message out that you want marketing to be more human, with a more human presence, because I know as well as you should, we all should, that humans connect with other humans better than things, objects but to be honest humans connect more to cute little animals it seems to me. The type of humans we really need to be getting on board like cute little animals but that's only my opinion.


[07-Jul-21 05:23 AM] Nev#5914
Yeah but we don't have them to work with somebody does but we don't.


[07-Jul-21 05:25 AM] Nev#5914

I disagree it is more human than past object stuff, like smart phone or lap tops but it is too distant to be human human presence it needs to be direct, direct marketing is person to person we don't want to be knocking people doors but we do want direct.

Is anyone here using bitclout? Myself and a few other pirates have been using it to promote Pirate Chain.

While researching PC I've been learning more about Komodo and am quite impressed and have been including it into my posts.

Has anyone already initiated a  KMD presence on bitclout and/or would anyone be interested in moving this initiative forward?

Yeah but the thing is if you or I had something that was important we could set up a virtual machine I inside our own machine I think.

Over my head but, if it works I’m all for it.

Yes I have seen a virtual windows running on Linux as well as Linux on Windows, I got Linux on windows somewhere I think. I am quite positive that I have seen stuff about virtual mac on windows so these things are out there.


[07-Jul-21 06:28 AM] Nev#5914
They slow your machine down though so no good for stuff like Divinci or Blender I don't think.


[07-Jul-21 06:34 AM] Nev#5914
Virtual machines are really very safe online because what your actually using is not really your operating system it is virtual. I have seen it used for catching scammers letting them connect to you so they think they are inside your machine but not really and then because they have connected you can get at them. Really funny stuff like deleting all their files and laughing at them as they panic because some guys have been lucky and able to grab operation of their camera, ha, ha, really funny.

Since it’s notarizing to LTC and not their competitor btc anymore

I’d be willing to pay half a years notarization fees if they go ahead 👀

But monthly update is that a video or just the text?

Its video, but we would prepare a doc w bulletpoints, links etc


[04-Aug-21 05:38 AM] hastrup#8742
How long are you thinking the video should be?

2-3 min

@hastrup  We would like it to be diff then official. But we could make playlist per language to center them  but i do think it would get wider reach if done personally or. Leta say "Komodo Russia News" as an example

Yey, Mastodon is something I have been wanting to get involved with for quite some time it is a decentralized model of operation, it is difficult to get full decentralization at this point as far as I can tell but it is much better than monopolization and total control by privileged individuals.

I sent some KMD from AtomicDex to Binance. for network between BSC and KMD I chose KMD.
my assets didn`t receive in exchange wallet


[14-Aug-21 07:33 AM] MJ2065#5211

A lot of hard work has been put to Komodo to build a foundation. From tech to business and we are working hard to accelerate the ongoing marketing efforts. As it was addressed on the townhall today - there's a lot of work that we have done and some of it isn't visible.

Thanks to the team for a job well done so far....have been here for a day but it's like I have opened my minds to a magical world


[19-Aug-21 11:35 AM] Enjo#9457
Holding kmd for 3 years and I understand the team achieved the great progress so far but the price can not seem to break out where the technology can do.


[19-Aug-21 11:57 AM] Audo#5667
Here are few highlights as timestamps from today:

```
10:53 - Regnar: Start adding CCs to KMD itself (or KMDCC) it would lower the barrier to entry to building stuff on KMD and increase demand. I don't want to have to launch a different chain or create one with no value to store in Q addresses, or to mint a token, or to open channels.

16:22 – Saskboy from Saskatchewan: Banner pulled by a plane.

19:08 – Crypto Devil.eth: Komodo dragon fighting punks and penguins

22:03 – Slavi Slavov: We need contracts with large companies.  Large companies to invest and implement komodo.  This is advertising.  They did not have an application of komodo and there is no point in advertising.

29:39 – Corellian Industries: A design channel on discord, where people can submit Komodo Mascot's and logo designs for the Komodo platform.   This can be extended to competitions, ntf's, infographics, merchandise, etc.

35:38 – Franswa' Andre' Ltd. Co.: How's this for a marketingLizardidea..? (https://twitter.com/MeetingEnt/status...)

38:26 – Peter Kim: Why do you pass on good technology to your partners, but no place mentions Komodo? Pay money, post news, and spread the word komodo a lot. Twitter and the website aren't everything.
```

I might have missed few questions that got answered. Timestamps are in the description of https://youtu.be/SeKoe9_gh3g

Здравствуйте Уважаемые Руководители и Администрация сайта https://mining.spaceworks.co/ Пишу от лица многих людей которые добывают монеты на вашем сайте. Мы были бы очень рады и признательны вам, если бы вы добавили на ваш сайт pool монету "XMR Monero" Так  как у многих сотен и тысяч людей компьютера, ноутбуки, горно-добывающие машины, фермы просто простаивают без дела. Надеюсь вы примите нашу просьбу и включите монету XMR  на ваш сайт. Заранее Благодарим.!   

Hello Dear Managers and Site Administration https://mining.spaceworks.co/  I am writing on behalf of many people who mine coins on your site. We would be very happy and grateful to you if you added the "XMR Monero" coin to your pool site Since many hundreds and thousands of people have computers, laptops, mining machines, farms are simply idle. I hope you will accept our request and include the XMR coin on your website. Thank you in advance.!

Thank you sir. Is it 5% rewards?


[27-Aug-21 09:52 AM] gcharang#6833
it comes out to 5% per year. if you claim monthly


[27-Aug-21 09:54 AM] JuguitoJuguitz#1959
Perfect. Would regulations affect KMD in a positive or negative way? Also any way to add KMD support for Bitfi hardware device?


[27-Aug-21 09:56 AM] gcharang#6833
just like any other crypto. regulations could hurt or improve ease of access to crypto for many people.

but, for atomicdex, the harder it is to use a CEX, the more people will use ADEX


[27-Aug-21 09:59 AM] JuguitoJuguitz#1959
That is true. TY for your thoughts. I think ADEX has huge potential. WHen Fiat ramp and how would it work?

Thanks for the invite. Saying hello!


[27-Aug-21 10:15 AM] gcharang#6833
no specifit ETA for a fiat onramp on atomicdex. and the ux would just be like a fiat onramp that is outside. users will need to kyc to use etc., the only benefit I can see is that users won't need to move their crypto to/from a 3rd wallet. they can buy sell for fiat on atomicdex and atomicswap for crypto in the same place

[27-Aug-21 10:29 AM] JuguitoJuguitz#1959
I see. Would it not be better to integrate a local monero into AtomicDEX to avoid KYC?


[27-Aug-21 10:31 AM] gcharang#6833
then, its not a "easy" fiat onramp. and any person who is able to use p2p platforms like local monero won't need it in the app in the first place, they will just use the site ina browser


[27-Aug-21 10:37 AM] JuguitoJuguitz#1959
Makes sense. I think we need to win this KYC battle and ADEX is the solution


[27-Aug-21 10:51 AM] gcharang#6833
bring fiat and a centralised system into a transaction and there is no way to get around KYC.

Hey all, don't have time to listen today but I wanted to share my thoughts on recent ca333 Tokel interview. The question was explain the relationship between kmd and atomicdex. To be fair ca333 has answered this question better before. But It brings up the point that there needs to be better explanation of the relationship between these two things. I think his answer was they both share a similar mindset. My thoughts were, what about the funding, didn't that come from supernet? Which is also the original idea of interoperability. Kmd being a main way to represent the supernet assets. And kmd the tech to help spawn an ecosystem. Adex being the vehicle to help connect the ecosystem and outside crypto. And most importantly kmd's status and benefits of use with atomicdex. (Cheaper fees, etc). Just some positive feedback.


[02-Sep-21 09:58 AM] Audo#5667
On our previous updates we have talked about the new KMD use cases we are visioning - and many of those are related to AtomicDEX. We definitely need to develop a strong story for this - and we also want to create a dedicated KMD page on our website that explains everything.

Thanks for the feedback

also maybe we can brainstorm what reddit challenges we will be hosting so that I can make the proper icons.

yes @Mylo , I received it - I am just totally over buried so can't handle anything extra. Just few days ago I discussed with Marious how it would be good to tip good design submissions on Reddit and build a culture of tipping.

@Minigunner can you take a note of the Reddit tipbot idea and consider how it fits to your Reddit plan and how helpful it would be.

In regards to cmc and coin gecko listing. Has anyone tried figuring out exactly who the person is that makes the decision to list? Does anyone know anybody who works for these organizations? Direct lobby might be best.

The dex also needs dedicated advertising. Not just kmd advertising, but atomicdex advertising. If can't afford to advertise, then pick a fight. Hype up a competition. Make a spectacle. Do something that gets eyes on you.

I was thinking, when creating images there are only 3 basic shapes, how convenient, 1s, 2nd & 3rd, maybe, circle, square & triangle and over all winner could be all 3. Just a thought, I seem to think there was a call for ideas.

Id even go so far as to say that Atomicdex is now an un-marketable brand. Americans and many more can't use it. Geo block was said to be slated for removal, but hasn't happened. Who knows what the lawyers say today, tomorrow, or the next day. At this point either release a statement to the effect of we just won't be removing geo-block because lawyers, because smartfi partnership, or because bigoted towards Americans. I hope it's not bigotry. Who knows at this point. But Atomicdex as a brand isn't working. First off the name is too similar to Atomic wallet. This presents too much confusion. Second I know of several people, and have witnessed on discord, people who are trying out the dex, only to be geo blocked. These people often immediately give up. Maybe for some dogedex is an option, though mobile users also are wary of the test flight designation. But overall, Atomicdex the brand is suffering from these problems. It makes no sense to point people to a brand they can't use. 

Hence FreedomDex.


[21-Sep-21 11:00 AM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
And before I am written off as trolling. I do like the tech. It is amazing and fun to use. However the geo block pisses me off so much. So one way to look at this is that you have made a great product, but user experience pisses people off. That is 100% a fail

Being that kmd has multiple sources of revenue as opposed to just relying on the price of kmd, The issue is probably more complex than is being let on. But if Ptyx was able to take dogedex and run with it, I dont see why we cant do something similar with the blessing of the team.

I completely agree. I stopped showing friends how to use it/streaming thru discord for them. After the 3rd are you sure screen they don’t want to do it.

Yip AtomicDex is the greatest but... It still needs improvement and it should be called A-DEX which suits, seeing as A is the first letter of the English alphabet and usually means number one as well as being the only true decentralized DEX. Even with the pretenders calling their own endeavors DEX's it is still the Number 1, the only one and deserves to be called A, number 1. Just in case you don't know, capitalism is a soft name for war and in war there are no rules to obey from anybody, unless you lose. “The theory of perfect competition was essentially invented to idealize capitalism, to show it as firms, as these passive, supremely responsible entities that respond to consumer behavior but if you know anything about the history of firms and the history of capitalism you know that's not true they are always engaged in a war”, Anwar Shaikh, Professor of Economics at the New School.  So that is the state of play, we are in a perpetual war, like it or not. The aim of the Komodo Platform, the developers, jl777 and many others has always been as far as I can tell, The Grand Unification of all crypto currencies, not separation. It seems that Komodians are in the great war, the war to end all wars, the Grand Unification.

The Grand Unification is used as a term to signify the coming together of Newtonian physics and Quantum physics. It has not been achieved yet as far as I know.


[23-Sep-21 09:06 AM] mikael hannes#4599
it could be possible to reconcile the two systems since they are both intrinsically based on mathematics.


[23-Sep-21 09:10 AM] Nev#5914
Yip, sure that is the driving force of it but has not been achieved yet as far as I know, although I have seen some very promising theory and experiments so might be just around the next bend.

Auroracoin, the "other" anonymously developed coin and one of only a couple coins in the top 2 coins,  ALSO believes strongly in the original mission of cryptocurrencies.  ( I just took over the project this year)   LOVE Komodo's vision.

Due to the risks that might appear we want to give an opportunity to people to still be able to participate and receive the necessary information on Komodo Tech and project itself. If it would be on our hands to Just do it on grounds, we would, but the possibility to offer other solution is something that not all other projects did offer or will. @DurpyDoo

Auroracoin was at #2 on CMC for a day or so in 2014 before the worlds first airdrop.  Unfortunately the meteoric rise in price led to a massive sell-off and a loss in momentum.  Iceland is also a really small nation so there was only a few people interested in contributing.  I have been rebuilding for a few years.  We are on AtomicDEX

You already know you can  claim everyday if you want but you are making even when you are sleeping with KMD.


[23-Sep-21 09:31 AM] DurpyDoo#7910
What?


[23-Sep-21 09:32 AM] Nev#5914
Do you get extra KMD by just having it in your wallet? Even when you are sleeping.


[23-Sep-21 09:33 AM] DurpyDoo#7910
Just the claim reward


[23-Sep-21 09:33 AM] Artakush#4285
It is better to claim every 30 days as after the claim of rewards (5.1%) need to wait for almost a small hour. so you loose few hours per month if you do it daily. Otherwise if you claim once in 30 days you do not loose the acumulation of several hours, just an hour


[23-Sep-21 09:33 AM] DurpyDoo#7910
It looks like day 1 is a bit higher than waiting.


[23-Sep-21 09:34 AM] jspook16#3059

[23-Sep-21 09:35 AM] Nev#5914
Yip, everyday is not good if you don't have a lot of coins and if you do have a lot of coins then every day compounds a little quicker.


[23-Sep-21 09:35 AM] Artakush#4285
not sure if that is true


[23-Sep-21 09:35 AM] Artakush#4285
after each claim you loose an hour, but I see what you mean


[23-Sep-21 09:36 AM] Nev#5914
It was according to the calculator that was available at some point.


[23-Sep-21 09:38 AM] Nev#5914
I claim once a month though I am not a rich man.


[23-Sep-21 09:38 AM] DurpyDoo#7910
Max compounding is a pretty good method.


[23-Sep-21 09:38 AM] DurpyDoo#7910
Daily claims adds it to your next round.


[23-Sep-21 09:41 AM] Nev#5914
Yes, but with having a small stash you loose out everyday because you lose an hour of staking so over a week you lose 7 hours.


[23-Sep-21 09:42 AM] DurpyDoo#7910
Do you lose enough in the hour to make a difference?


[23-Sep-21 09:43 AM] Nev#5914
According to the calculator I used, yes but there is a threshold where once past that threshold you gain, the threshold being a lot of coins how many I can't remember, sorry..


[23-Sep-21 09:44 AM] DurpyDoo#7910
Like I said, day 1 seems to have a higher reward

The first thing that will help kmd price is a hedging mechanism which we hope to build with collateralizable kmd .  As we build out their ecosystem there are opportunities we can seize to aid in a buyback mechanism.   Also some things we can tweak like the dexfee to aid kmd which has just been on the backburner for now.   Basically copying general strategy of smartfi and trying to apply to our ecosystem.  Speculation , Hedging, Buybacks.    Building around this structure we can find out metrics about the price that will allow us to have a real market

Just throwing some ideas out there.... thinking of three additional CC modules. First, how about a Loan-CC that Lenders can lock up their SFUSD into for lending. The Loan-CC accepts only KMD as collateral. Borrowers put up their KMD collateral for a predefined LTV, and they forfeit their KMD rewards to be paid out to lenders monthly. This could give borrowers loans with no interest rate, just forfeit the KMD rewards. (that or forfeit kmd rewards AND very LOW interest rates on the loan). Further, if a loan is defaulted, part of the KMD is distributed to lenders, part is sent to the Distribution-CC. The Distribution-CC immediately distributes a proportional amount to all holders of 100 KMD or more (or whatever quantity is defined up front) and the rest of the KMD is sent to the Speculation-CC.
Why would someone choose to use Loan-CC instead of a loan over SmartFi? Well assumption is that the Loan-CC is automated, on-DEX availability, and no KYC to use it. However, there is an issue once rewards stop for KMD (which is just a few years away). 
Then we can have a Speculation-CC (more of Lottery-CC that takes the defaulted KMD and holds it in a "pot". The Speculation-CC accepts entries from users to guess the price of KMD for a defined time and date (for example everyday at 1200 UTC). There is a price per entry paid in SFUSD (say 1 SFUSD per guess-entry). If users guess correctly the pot is paid out to them. Otherwise the pot keeps stays for the next day. The SFUSD it collects can then be forwarded to the Loan-CC so that the Speculation-CC is earning KMD as well and its pot continues to grow. I know its crazy, but its a thought. All of the entries in the Speculation-CC could provide some data points on the sentiment of KMD price.

I don't know what will be the criteria for determining the winner but public voting is a disaster. Carbon Social just had photography contest, with crypto/fiat prizes - it was a surge of trolls and fake accounts voting for themselves.


[28-Sep-21 04:51 PM] Nev#5914
Yes, that is a point and I have been exposed to what you describe but I am quite confident in Minigunner so wait for announcement. On the other side of this is: an art/photography/merit type competition brings endeavour, focus, practice, creations, all good outcomes regardless of prizes. Then there is other peoples interpretations, exposure, just entering is an achievement and work could come from it as well, which would result in all of the above again.  I do understand that the main point of entering a competition of any kind should be to win but I try to focus on expectations I am sure of winning. As well as "The more I practice the luckier I get". All the best and good wishes.

funnily on yt i watched this instrument being played about 2 days ago.


[01-Oct-21 04:42 AM] Nev#5914
Yeah, I know it's not a joke although it looks like one at first glance, I was wondering if the front instruments with strings over lapping acted like a sitar causing resonance in the other strings. I was looking for something I seen as a kid, it was a depiction of a drunken man  hanging onto a lamp post and it said "One for the road" I think it was a whisky decanter of sorts, probably a holiday souvenir from England (maybe Scotland but don't remember a kilt) and I got this as a search result with the other image and others too but no man hanging onto the lamp post.  "One for the road" is similar to PTYX's "one more before takeoff" probably a play on words, interesting how language morphs. I think I might have seen it being played as well a while back, I often search around looking for unusual stuff and probably why it came up, as I said many times search is not search more like preference. I think I will try the search in Presearch as that seems to be the best at the moment for real almost search.  I tried and it did not come up in presearch a lot of the other images did including the old man holding up his glass. Interesting little journey before I start my day, thanks.

I got a pet Oak tree, I have had it in a plant pot for a couple of years and looking for somewhere to plant it.


[04-Oct-21 07:09 AM] Nev#5914
Slugs, slugs and more slugs, I even looked into eating them because I have a lot and could be a good meal except I don't fancy them.


[04-Oct-21 07:11 AM] Artakush#4285
i did eat slugs


[04-Oct-21 07:11 AM] Artakush#4285
aint that muchos delicioso


[04-Oct-21 07:12 AM] Nev#5914
They are dangerous if you don't cook the correctly, they have dangerous brain eating worms.


[04-Oct-21 07:12 AM] Artakush#4285
i had them made, gladly, i would not risk with making it myself


[04-Oct-21 07:13 AM] Nev#5914
I stop the slug with copper tape I put it around pots so they don't climb past it.

@Artakush  English is not your first language, that's what it is, no good long term practice with English. After all, English is a made up language, not just you but others have the same problem as well. English did not grow as a language it was invented for Henry the 8th to send the Catholic Church off packing so he could marry and murder another wife or something like that.

@Artakush Just for good measure here is an example of funky English.                                                                                                        
"Dos and Don'ts vs. Do's and Don'ts vs. Do's and Don't's
We're back this week with another highly debated style issue! How do you correctly format dos and don'ts or do's and don'ts? 

The general grammar consensus is that you don't use apostrophes to make words or abbreviations plural. Take DVDs, elephants, or 1950s, for example, since no apostrophes were used, but these words and phrases reference multiple of the same objects, years, animals, etc.

However, the English language isn't always black and white and does have some funky rules and expectations, and dos and don'ts definitely falls into this category. 

Additionally, this issue has the uncommon case that major style guides actually disagree with each other. Some prefer one way and others another.

So, how do you decide to format this phrase correctly? The short answer is, it is up to you!"

I’m not the one that kicked you, but Komodo is pretty lenient with fud or negativity


[09-Nov-21 04:11 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
But if someone has posted nothing but attack comments day in day out for months then I can see why they would


[09-Nov-21 05:51 PM] Mylo#8306
do you have short term goals or long term goals?
if you have short term, historically there have been better options to make sats, but also historically plenty of scams.
if you can make 8k KMD somewhere else, to buy it back in a couple of weeks, maybe that's an option.
i'm not a trader, so i hodl what i have 🤷‍♂️


[09-Nov-21 08:56 PM] Best#0130
Members who criticize much more heavily than me were not banned. It was a much milder criticism that I wrote, although I was kicked out without warning. I've been getting kmd for months.


[09-Nov-21 09:01 PM] Best#0130
I think whoever banned me has a special grudge against me. I have never spread fud, I am very active in the local group, I praise komodo everywhere and attract investors. I accept that I may be wrong in my criticism. As I said again, I was kicked out while there were members who criticized more severely than me.

[10-Nov-21 06:07 AM] Best#0130
I wrote it here because I thought I was banned unfairly. I didn't come here recently. I came because I thought it was unfair. I thought maybe you would remove the ban. Because I love Komodo


[10-Nov-21 06:08 AM] Best#0130
For some, getting banned is unimportant. It's important because I think I've been wronged.


[10-Nov-21 06:11 AM] Best#0130
Members who criticize more than me were not banned. But I got banned immediately. I think it's unfair and I can't make sense of it.

I have dabbled in procedurally generated images with random inputs. Most of the time these are designs, not really avatars, but I've also messed with some avatar creating too. I'm not an artist and most of these avatars are comprised of hundreds of individual components that all need to be drawn, then they are randomly selected and added to the base avatar. Or at least that's how I've done it and seen it done. Creating these hundreds of components is pretty intensive for me, especially without any artistic software


[12-Nov-21 03:56 AM] Regnar#6164
So for me I have a couple algorithms that get applied consistently, then I give it random starting inputs, select colors at random or via theme, and sometimes apply mask to end result.

Interesting - we could try it out.

@ramonster42 is creating the avatars and I am sure we could try out how we could draw individual components. We could make a quick demo/trial so we all understand how it would work.

@Regnar do you have requirements for Ramon so we could try it out? Maybe we can make some Komodo avatar generator online?


[15-Nov-21 12:34 AM] Audo#5667
Discord released a new feature, let's try it out!

Here's our next hangout: https://discord.gg/aFVYYE4c?event=909722926813687829

Yep. automatic time zone

Maybe not requirements, but I've used a few different prebuilt code and modified it for my own purposes. There's some JS ones that are really nice and others in Python which I like.

Enjoyed them all, super, thanks, prefer  #5 , something living inside, not just a suit, bringing that element of human emotion to the fore, perhaps more endearing? Would prefer a tongue rather than teeth, less fierce, more like a doggy type thing. All of them passed and are great, perhaps a shield on 5 as well?  Thanks again.

One more


[27-Nov-21 10:45 AM] Kelcie#1924
question, why submit to facebook sites that are for art review and feedback. I like the direction that @ramonster42 is heading with these and sometimes excess external feedback does more harm than good to the artistic process. Maybe it is just me, but to have a large amount of "internet professionals" give feedback is EXTREMELY overwhelming. plus it creates more work to implement those changes


[27-Nov-21 10:46 AM] Kelcie#1924
IDK I am naturally overwhelmed by anything though


[27-Nov-21 10:47 AM] Kelcie#1924
Yeah, sure constructive criticism and fresh eyes are great but everyone has a different artistic style and process


[27-Nov-21 10:49 AM] Kelcie#1924
if the goal is to advertise KMD to other communities, is there a better way that we can do this without disturbing his artistic process?

[27-Nov-21 11:24 AM] Artakush#4285
Another thing I would add is IF promoting, you can do it your way OR ask us(team, community) how to "frame" it. Everybody are vocal of things they would like to see or post, why not collaborate. We have so many great minds here. 
I must say I do appreciate the point out on "How", support words and Tweets or Posts are ways of reaching uncharted audience :market_up:

[28-Nov-21 09:11 AM] Balu#6818

[28-Nov-21 09:11 AM] Balu#6818

[28-Nov-21 09:14 AM] Balu#6818

[28-Nov-21 09:14 AM] Balu#6818

yeah you dont have a member role yet


[28-Nov-21 09:17 AM] jspook16#3059
no one else has reported issues joining up to now. You dont get any kind of message when you join? Is there a ten minute wait to start posting?


[28-Nov-21 09:18 AM] Balu#6818
nah nothing and no wait


[28-Nov-21 09:18 AM] Balu#6818
i am joining things regularly and no problems there so not sure what to make of it


[28-Nov-21 09:19 AM] Balu#6818
cant you asign the role manually to me?


[28-Nov-21 09:19 AM] Balu#6818

Qt and C++
Small size app
Efficient on system resources 
Nice UI/UX


[15-Dec-21 05:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
And many cryptocurrencies supported. Even if not using for decentralised exchange purposes, it’s still best as a wallet.

KomodoTales is a relaxed way to learn cryptocurrency stories behind the screens.  Not analysis, Komodians tell their tale. I narrate and film.

Is it possible to gain profit on AtomicDex? E.g. LTC --> KMD --> LTC you get 0.015 USD extra


[24-Dec-21 08:32 PM] Marx1001#5313
Atomicdex uses traditional orderbooks. You can earn from spread or arbitrage.


[24-Dec-21 08:35 PM] tyler2225#6959
KMD --> AXE is about 0.5 USD profit


[24-Dec-21 08:52 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Yes, there’s a section on dex stats where you can see arb opportunities if i remember correctly

we should have a curriculum guide for which of the Komodo blockchain fundamental series to read in order to really get things to click. There could be required reading and then some optional deep dives that expand on a topic.

For example reading about SHA256 and 512 probably go after the hashing algorithm introduction (required), and can probably be option deep dives.

Something like a basic blockchain overview and article of the courses laid out. Then maybe the problem blockchain tries to solve with some optional background history like the inflation article.

Then the primers on the components that make up blockchains, asymmetric encryption, hashing, Byzantine generals, double spending, digital signatures, consensus etc.

Then there could be more specific wallets section, trading section, defi, mining algorithms, etc.

After it gets expanded out a bit more we could add practice questions to the bottom of each article. And then afterwards you do a quiz on the entire curriculum and can get a certificate.

We can even issue the certificate as an NFT with Komodo.

usually the issue is bandwidth and how complicated it is to develop something

we can track actual power expended for manual labor ....and perhaps some way to track brain power

its not a real project....its more of a means to get atomicdex some exposure. Here is the excerpt of the post in Komodian Discord


[13-Jan-22 09:33 AM] jspook16#3059
DUST is a komodo smartchain. The idea behind the trading events involves distributing DUST via a tip bot in the discords of participating coins (KMD, ARRR, VERUS, etc) with their permission. The participants receive their DUST and can withdraw it to atomicDEX (or any DEX available) and trade it against real coins such as KMD VRSC ARRR. The request will be made to communities to see if they want to participate by putting up orders against DUST. I will be putting up some of my own funds as well. The idea is to expose people to atomicswaps. After a trading event, a request will be made to send DUST funds back to a community address so that we can recycle the coins for a subsequent trading event. 
DUST is NOT meant to have any value outside of these trading events. DUST nodes can be shutdown at any time after a trading event. 
Why a new coin and not an existing test coin such as Rick or Morty?: The Rick and Morty coins were distributed a long time ago and there may be large amounts of these coins held by individuals. This would make the trading event unfair to new comers. 
What phase is DUST at?: DUST has been launched and listed on atomicDEX. It will be on the next release of atomicDEX. We are working with @Bago to hopefully get a tipbot going for DUST. After a tipbot is created, a request to existing ecosystem communities will be made to see if they want to participate by putting up real funds against DUST. Then a date/time will be set for a trading event with basic instructions of how the event will play out. Once everything is in place, the distribution will begin via tipbot rains.

the webcomic that won does not have the word atomicdex anywhere, it should be disqualified


[13-Jan-22 02:32 PM] blacktrukm#8082
I made another design and I took pains to continue with each step and the winner did not follow any of them, he did not have any of the two required words

Dude you filled in some word bubbles. Chill out

Yip, there is no AtomicDEX as stipulated, that is correct but I had an entry in the same competition and would have voted for the winner had I been able. I was quite disappointed that I couldn't vote for Minigunner's work because I am not a member of Reddit but I wasn't going to try to kick up a fuss about something that is just a method to get more people involved or join a million crappy sites for the point of voting. I can't say your incorrect but I can say I am happy with the winner, well done Minigunner.😀

On the same note, it is why you can't trust human beings to be in charge of anything they are just not trustworthy even when they are honest they still make mistakes. "The danger is not that a particular class is unfit to govern. Every class is unfit to govern."

Congrats @Minigunner  :KMD:    I really do not see him mentioning webDEX instead of atomicDEX as an issue. Maybe just to those that entered the competition. Plus, this was voted on.  Votes have spoken.

The Stranglers - Tank / Curfew (Revolver 1978)
I wish someone would make a decent music programme like this again. The UK used to produce some great music shows, but all I see these days are a pile of shit. Even later with Jools Holland has gone downhill, it used to be cool but now most of the people he invites on that show is just self gratifying crap so he can join in and boogie woogie alo...
