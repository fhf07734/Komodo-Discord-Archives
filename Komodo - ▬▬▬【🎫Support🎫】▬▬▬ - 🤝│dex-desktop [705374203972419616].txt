@naezith-work Hello, is it normal for the public address ? Should use the good one

looking into it


[30-Apr-20 05:33 AM] Slyris#2880
Ok @Surfer007 Regarding your connection issue, did you install it with installer, or you use the windows bundle ?


[30-Apr-20 05:34 AM] Slyris#2880
Afer that, can you tell me if you get the same problem with both (Bundled version, and the Version installed with the installer)


[30-Apr-20 06:07 AM] uak#6718
1. nice colors and design easy to run
2. license are asked twice once in installation and once in opening the App
3. needs admin permission to launch
4. asks for port permission on multiple launches sometimes
5. UTXO coins are listed  like bitcoin cash listed then dash then litcoin, this could make someone angry :D
6. sometimes I open and "all addersses are invalid"
7. forget coins on restart sometimes


[30-Apr-20 06:07 AM] uak#6718
8. EULA is scary but I think we are using some KOMOD service in the backend right? Didn't notice mention to open source code license there


[30-Apr-20 06:08 AM] uak#6718
9. when try to enable a coin It doesn't mark coins that are already enabled


[30-Apr-20 06:51 AM] uak#6718
for me coins came back after one restart

The atomic pro UX is great very intuitive design liking it so far for an alpha version , it would be nice to have a brief description of each asset there quite a few eco system asset and it easy to forget what they are and their utility, hopefully the feature is added otherwise cool app so far


[30-Apr-20 11:39 AM] Regnar#6164
Yea that might be a good idea. Probably could add a JSON file with coin name, symbol, description, that it can pull and look at, would make it easier to update coin info on existing software too. Checks current repo against local JSON, and either updates or uses local. could also be turned off if the user prefers to not get new coins/info

I have a general question to the swaps


[01-May-20 02:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
I started 3 dex/kmd swaps...they all stucks a long time in 2/3 swap ongoing...now the first swap was successful...am i right that it depends from confirmations when swap is done?


[01-May-20 02:58 AM] Acura#2748
my Swap has taken around 15minutes with AtomicDex Pro - patience


[01-May-20 03:01 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yes yes i know but i am asking from what it depends...my guess was if a minimum of confirmation are done swap is successful...for example my other 2 dex/kmd swaps are also successful now


[01-May-20 03:01 AM] Acura#2748
maybe it have something to do with dpow confirmations ?


[01-May-20 03:02 AM] Deleted User#0000
And i watch the explorer paralel and see it was between 16 and 18 confirmations


[01-May-20 03:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
So if for example there is alwasy a  defined amount of confirmations needed it will be very helpful to know


[01-May-20 03:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
For example there could be another information under 2/3 swap ongoing


[01-May-20 03:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
Like 13/16 confirmations


[01-May-20 03:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
So the user know that swap works  and only has to wait for some other confirmations


[01-May-20 03:05 AM] Deleted User#0000
At the beginning i thought that swap doesnt work but if my theory is correct it all make sense :-)


[01-May-20 03:06 AM] cipi#4502
KMD and other KMD ACs are waiting for a notarization: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins/blob/master/coins#L1612


[01-May-20 03:09 AM] Deleted User#0000
Okey and its always defined?


[01-May-20 03:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
For example 16 confirmatipns for dex/kmd


[01-May-20 03:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
Or 2 confirmations for btc/kmd?


[01-May-20 03:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
Or is it random?


[01-May-20 03:14 AM] Deleted User#0000
In the link above i found that kmd and dex need 2 required confirmations but in my case swap was successful after 16


[01-May-20 03:14 AM] cipi#4502
afaik AtomicDEX-Pro fetches the coins file from the coins repo at build time
i hope it will be configurable in the future


[01-May-20 03:15 AM] cipi#4502
if requires_notarization is true, the required_confirmations means something else


[01-May-20 03:16 AM] cipi#4502
all coins with requires_notarization true have required_confirmations = 2


[01-May-20 03:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
Mhhh okey...then i dont understand when a swap is successful  and when not


[01-May-20 03:19 AM] cipi#4502
txs in KMD have 2 values `confirmations` and `raw_confirmations`
raw_confirmations are the "real" confirmations, whereas `confirmations` is only increased when the tx is notarized
so `requires_notarization` just tells the app where to look (confirmations or raw_confirmations)


[01-May-20 03:22 AM] jansako#3330
I think it is fair to say that a swap is 'successfully ongoing' unless there is an error on the swap progress saying it failed. Until it says failed, it is assumed to be ongoing. The unknown part is that the user cannot tell how much longer the 'ongoing' part is going to be. Users like to have their expectations set üôÇ


[01-May-20 03:22 AM] Deleted User#0000
Ok and where it is defined how many real confirmations needed?


[01-May-20 03:22 AM] jansako#3330
Pretty sure it is dynamic on a per-coin basis


[01-May-20 03:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
@jansako  so its not possible to integrate a function like 12 of 16 confirmations done?
Or estimated time 10 minutes?


[01-May-20 03:24 AM] jansako#3330
Creating and maintaining a correct matrix of all supported coins... plus it can also be user-defined I think if one is using CLI


[01-May-20 03:24 AM] jansako#3330
possible yes


[01-May-20 03:24 AM] jansako#3330
priority-wise?


[01-May-20 03:24 AM] jansako#3330
I agree that better user communication is necesary


[01-May-20 03:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
It was only a question if it possible because yeah...its a better user experience


[01-May-20 03:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
Its like on windows when you install something and dont know how long you have to wait...then i hate windows and want to cancel it


[01-May-20 03:25 AM] jansako#3330
The worst! üôÇ


[01-May-20 03:26 AM] cipi#4502
`requires_notarization` false
`required_confirmations` 5
will be the setting you are looking for


[01-May-20 03:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
I can open an issue on github


[01-May-20 03:27 AM] jansako#3330
Right, what we mean is to see how the UI can use this to display a more accurate depiction of the swap progress


[01-May-20 03:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
Maybe in future it will be integrated


[01-May-20 03:27 AM] jansako#3330
without scaring the user with too much tech detail


[01-May-20 03:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
Correct


[01-May-20 03:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
üëç


[01-May-20 03:28 AM] jansako#3330
the balance is the key here, right now the info amount is too far on the scarce side.


[01-May-20 03:28 AM] Deleted User#0000
But by the way...atomic dex pro looks very good to me...easy to understand


[01-May-20 03:29 AM] jansako#3330
Agree! I can see how they went for the "minimum anything necessary to get the job done"!


[01-May-20 04:01 AM] Slyris#2880
@Surfer007 Do you still have the issue without vpn ?


[01-May-20 04:01 AM] Slyris#2880
I'm not able to reproduce the connection issue, and i didn't get any other feedback with the same issue


[01-May-20 04:02 AM] TonyL#3577
It might be worth to check windows firewall also if it's enabled


[01-May-20 04:06 AM] Slyris#2880
For people who care about the fact that the version of atomicdex installed via the installer requires administrator (On Windows) rights this is normal

The executable needs to store information close to its installation, sensitive data that we do not want to save in AppData, or in your personal Documents folder. 

However if you do not want to use administrator rights you can take the zipped version of the project and use it in a folder that does not require user rights.

I personally use the zipped version in my document folder.


[01-May-20 04:11 AM] jansako#3330
If I set the shortcut to 'run as admin' and it bypasses the Windows pop-up, then the release version should by default install in that state. Then add a disclaimer or a checkbox on the Installer UI to allow people to opt out of it.


[01-May-20 04:12 AM] jansako#3330
That way you get ease of use for people that do not care (99%)


[01-May-20 04:12 AM] jansako#3330
and 'security' for people that do


[01-May-20 04:12 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah @jansako but the problem is that we didn't find a way in QT with @naezith-work to add this option.


[01-May-20 04:12 AM] Slyris#2880
For the installer


[01-May-20 04:13 AM] Slyris#2880
As soon we find a reliable solution for that, we will apply it


[01-May-20 04:14 AM] jansako#3330
When you creating the shortcut, you can't programatically make it as such? Interesting... Must be the 'feature' of whatever you use to build the installer then. Pretty sure the InstallShield allows for it...


[01-May-20 04:17 AM] jansako#3330
Please don't say that you are building your own installer from scratch!


[01-May-20 04:36 AM] Slyris#2880
@jansako No, we use the QT Tools that generate an installer for us, and there is no such an option inside this tool ^^'

Hello Devs will it be possible to assign dollar value to all orders

So I can hover around a order and get it dollar value , its difficult to  calculate supernet and Dex buying and selling price for example

@mobipoi 

This is possible with coin like `KMD`, `BTC`, but for `DEX` we need data that are collected by `CMC` or `Coinpaprika`.

Would be easier to implement it.

I know that some people from the community started to collect information about swap and maybe they have price data for `DEX` and other smartchains


[04-May-20 02:20 AM] jansako#3330
I see a couple of 'CD Release's on the GitHub page, should we leave those alone or are they OK to use to update?


[04-May-20 02:25 AM] mobipoi#5774
@Slyris  data can be collected indirectly , such as pegging Dex value to kmd and kmd value to USD ,


[04-May-20 02:26 AM] mobipoi#5774
Accuracy will increase of time as more volume and orders occur , but for now value can be based on kmd I think komodod dose something similar unless I am wrong

@jansako I implemented a basic export functionality in the backend, without filter for the moment, and without event array.

I need to check what we want to export but basically:

```csv
Maker Coin, Taker Coin, Maker Amount, Taker Amount, Type, Events, My Info, Is Recoverable, UUID
```

will look like that ^


[04-May-20 05:00 AM] Slyris#2880
(Events, My info, and UUID are not added yet)


[04-May-20 05:00 AM] Slyris#2880
I think i will replace Events with a Status column "Success/Error"


[04-May-20 05:18 AM] jansako#3330
Sounds good. Consider the purpose of the export. It is not the same as a log file. I think you just need a date, what you bought, sold and how much of each. Maybe add a current inventory to be able to track that? I would label the columns as such as well. 'Maker amount/taker amount' are less user friendly as say 'sold/bought' or 'sent/received'.


[04-May-20 05:26 AM] Slyris#2880
Thanks you for the feedback @jansako

Data for the taxman


[04-May-20 08:44 AM] Regnar#6164
if it's for tax purposes it might be worth adding a USD value of the trade.


[04-May-20 08:45 AM] Regnar#6164
or at least a fiat


[04-May-20 09:22 AM] jansako#3330
It could be for evaluating how good a trader you are (or not), how your inventory moves (will be important when trading many pairs), taxes of course, it is more that the user has useful tools. Whether they choose to pay their taxes or not is beside the point.


[04-May-20 09:46 AM] Regnar#6164

Hi, not sure if I am in the correct channel. I Have the Android 'AtomicDex' app, channel names are #ü§ù‚îÇdex-mobile and #ü§ù‚îÇdex-desktop . Anyhow, I love to give some feedback. I just started my first DEX exchange trade. After starting the app is providing a falling coins sound, but it is in a loop. It is not stopping at all. Not sure if that is how it should be, but for me it is a reason to hard stop the app in Android.


[05-May-20 02:12 PM] jansako#3330
It is the other channel :-). That said, Android requires a sound, otherwise the app goes to sleep in the background & the swaps would fail or never even start (as Maker). The workaround for now is to use a sound file with no sound in it so it will 'play', but no sound. The steps should be in the -beta channel.


[05-May-20 03:09 PM] Jurjen#9294
That would be a nice workaround. I hope it will be updated soon with that workaround. unfortnally I can't code in Java, but let me know if devs like a bounty for it or so


[05-May-20 03:15 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Because it being a crypto app app stores scrutinize them a bit more and are concerned about the app running in the background.  Not so much a tech issue but a bureaucracy issue.   Maybe we will find another work around

It's been a while that I used the komodo dex. Last time was a couple of years ago from the Linux desktop. Currently I am trying to exchange sia into dai because the convertor from makerdao isn't active anymore and they recommend a dex. But my transaction is running for a night now, and no trade seems to be happen. Is there something I do misunderstood?

Matching issues were related to global network problems, it was improved via seed nodes optimisation


[10-May-20 01:40 AM] TonyL#3577
Bot should work, probably just mm2 bin should be updated in bundles 
@smkhound can publish new release with fresh mm2 if there will be demand. But there was no ¬´¬†hardforking ¬†¬ª change for end clients, only for seed nodes

`rpc_password` is arbitrary, just set a random secure string in the config and use it when issuing the rpc calls
rest are explained at <https://github.com/smk762/mmbot_qt/blob/style/docs/README.rst#config> as pointed by smk762

[16-May-20 07:39 AM] Regnar#6164
A random thought I had, does Atomicdex Pro have local API endpoints? For example, could I write a Python script that performs trades by making post requests to a `localhost:port/atomicdex/` endpoint?


[16-May-20 07:39 AM] Regnar#6164
Or will are RPCs still the standard?


[16-May-20 07:42 AM] Regnar#6164
I was thinking it might be cool to have a developer tab which gives API docs within Atomicdex pro, so you could run Pro and trade as normal, or easily run your own script on the side that interacts with it via local API endpoints. This would make building trading bots a lot easier and could open up 3rd party dev communities to build add on extensions for Atomicdex like a trading bot that has ping pong strategy, or another that trades bollinger bands, etc


[16-May-20 09:36 AM] Regnar#6164
To expand on this a bit. There isn't a "developer tab" but just something you can open under settings that shows you all the API end points currently available and you can activate these (by default it doesn't accept commands from them). There could be two types of endpoints, those requiring Auth and those that don't. So you could turn on just general APIs or both.


[16-May-20 09:41 AM] Regnar#6164
Non-Auth APIs would have things like all available coins on DEX, current market price, 24hour trade volume (might need to get elsewhere from a source that aggregates it 24/7, if the local DEX isn't running for a full day)


[16-May-20 09:41 AM] Regnar#6164
coin info from jl777 coins file
```
"coin": "KMD",
"name": "komodo",
"fname": "Komodo",
"rpcport": 7771,
"pubtype": 60,
"p2shtype": 85,
"wiftype": 188,
"txversion": 4,
"overwintered": 1,
"txfee": 1000,
"mm2": 1,
"required_confirmations": 2,
"requires_notarization": true```


[16-May-20 09:43 AM] Regnar#6164
basically anything that a 3rd party app might need to provide additional value added services without having direct access to user funds or trading abilities


[16-May-20 09:46 AM] Regnar#6164
the Auth APIs would need an API key/token that is generated in the app (if activated) which would allow API endpoints to perform trades, get user balances, get trade UUID information, past completed trade data (similar to the trade info CSV that was discussed earlier), get deposit addresses, activate new coins, withdraw funds, change tx fee amounts, alter required confirmations, etc. Basically most other functionality that involves user funds and potentially sensitive data like trade history, balances, and addresses


[16-May-20 09:48 AM] Regnar#6164
Having these two distinctions would restrict 3rd party apps to only what they say they will do. For example an app that gives uses general API for price notifications on large deviations from CEX prices but doesn't perform trades, would not be able to secretly perform trades or withdraw funds because it doesn't have the API key.


[16-May-20 09:50 AM] Regnar#6164
Additionally AtomicDEX Pro and this API server function would benefit from a "Background" mode, that allows the GUI to be closed but to still run the DEX and server in the background (maybe with an icon in the toolbar to show it is still active) this way you could simply passively run the DEX and scripts that run with it, without having to run the GUI front end all the time taking up screen space (some people are anti clutter)


[16-May-20 09:19 PM] smkhound#7640

[16-May-20 09:54 PM] Mylo#8306
https://github.com/smk762/mmbot_api/blob/master/lib/rpclib.py looks like calling these is what you want reg


[17-May-20 04:41 AM] Regnar#6164
Right I was wondering if that would be standard, that the APIs would be available by default from the running DEX GUI. So developers can build easier and end users can add custom scripts easily too without having to run multiples. 

I'm imagining it like extensions for a browser, they could just download simple scripts that add to the experience by using the API. There could even be UI things that could be tweaked via custom scripts, custom skins, themes, email plugins, trollbox, etc.


[17-May-20 04:43 AM] Regnar#6164
It would be easier and probably safer if the devs could just look at the API docs and interact with it, instead of making their own API wrappers that then do custom things. Though I'm not sure you can really limit that?


[17-May-20 05:46 AM] Mylo#8306
if gui is running, mm2 is running.
if you're on *nix, `netstat -ptan | grep 7783` 
try any of the curl commands from dev doc site


[17-May-20 05:46 AM] Mylo#8306
UI is different to API, no tweaking via mm2 api.  ui is up to ui devs to enable that sort of stuff


[17-May-20 05:48 AM] Mylo#8306
"the devs" being curious non-kmd devs?  yeah they can use curl to experiment.  for api wrapper, there is unofficial/community  py above, unofficial/community nodejs & maybe a go & rust one as well. 
kmd roadmap has official wrapper libs, so that is one for the future


[17-May-20 05:49 AM] gcharang#6833
I think GUI sets the userpass dynamically right now


[17-May-20 05:51 AM] Mylo#8306
maybe `ps aux | grep mm2` will display userpass


[17-May-20 06:05 AM] Regnar#6164
Right, I figured curl commands would be possible since it's running. I'm not sure if curl would be easier to develop for than APIs, I figured the APIs would give a bit of protection since it can have general vs auth endpoints, but I guess if someone is downloading 3rd party stuff it can do anything anyway via curl. I just figured there is less risk for tinkerers to make mistakes if they have some given APIs that come "by default" with the GUI. 

You run the GUI, and say you run a python requests script to get current prices, you just do something like:
```python
prices = requests.get('localhost:7783/atomicdex/prices').json()
```
Which would be much simpler than running middleware to check if it's running, etc


[17-May-20 06:08 AM] Mylo#8306
rpc interface doesn't look like rest url.  no /atomicdex/prices.  it's only localhost:7783/ with a json object passed into it.  need a middleware for rest interface


[17-May-20 06:09 AM] Regnar#6164
I know, I'm suggesting adding a light server like smk762 posted (uvicorn) so that by default you could activate it and use it.


[17-May-20 06:09 AM] Regnar#6164
Not sure if there is a demand for that though


[17-May-20 06:10 AM] Mylo#8306
oh sorry, i read nothing of that üòÑ


[17-May-20 06:10 AM] Mylo#8306
yes, running a lightweight thing inbetween makes it much more dev friendly


[17-May-20 06:11 AM] Regnar#6164
And in settings you could check off `activate API endpoints` with two different types `general` `permissioned` or something


[17-May-20 06:12 AM] Mylo#8306
i reckon too much to package into a gui.  if devs are gonna wanna dev, they can just run a dev middleware package


[17-May-20 06:15 AM] Regnar#6164
Yea that's what I was wondering, if it had something already. For example the nSPV package from github has a server to run the web GUI. I thought it would be useful for people to do things like build chrome extensions that pull market data or even post swaps via the API (Running the GUI in background)

Does Pro forcibly select the best rate offer on the board no matter what I choose?


[18-May-20 05:21 PM] daemonfox#6136
Was playing with KMD/ETH and made a completely stupid ETH offer for 5X the KMD going rate


[18-May-20 05:21 PM] daemonfox#6136
When I selected to match it, there were two other offers for about market rate...


[18-May-20 05:22 PM] daemonfox#6136
I clicked Confirm in the first screens showing the inflated rate of my test... but once I hit the last button, it linked me to the better rate offer


[18-May-20 05:22 PM] daemonfox#6136
and ignored my inflated offer I chose to match to

[19-May-20 01:16 AM] Slyris#2880
@jansako Maybe you can orientate your tests around edge case based on the changelog of this version.

Our goal is to stabilize the application and have the same behavior as the mobile version.

Then there is also the huge work that is in progress on the new user interface, which means that we will probably not fix the glitch of the current UI.

Once the new user interface is ready, there will surely be display bugs, glitch, so we will have to find and fix them.


[19-May-20 01:18 AM] Slyris#2880
Once the new user interface is ready and works smoothly, we can talk about new features from users (through github issue) etc.

Sounds good, thank you sir!

Do you have an internal issue for the BTC & BCH address showing the same? I know it was reported previously, let me know if you want a GitHub issue for it or if it is already being handled.


[19-May-20 01:49 AM] TonyL#3577
Generation of the same addresses for BTC and BCH is expected at the moment (https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins/blob/master/coins#L377 https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins/blob/master/coins#L211 )

@mobipoi thanks for the feedback. the existing ux/ui is going to be completely overhauled and the new designs do highlight the DEX part in contrast to the wallet. the current ui was an attempt at reproducing all the features available in mobile version. once the initial version of the new UI is out, we will welcome all feedback from the community

what‚Äôs needed is a kickass sexy wallet like exodus. Complete secure and multi currency. Paired with an atomic swap dex. Also, a shapeshift life website hosted on ipfs. Then we need external liquidity integration, quantum orderbooks, and easy to use bots. From there maybe some derivatives. Might be hard to get AppStore‚Äôs to keep apps, so maybe a pure web interface is needed. Recently trustwallet had to remove their dapp browser. I believe in you guys, I believe in privacy and security. Can‚Äôt wait!

The wallet part is pretty complete I think? So that part of the comparison to exodus already goes. If you see how many iterations per week we see as far as the atomic swap part goes I think we are well under way to get out of beta stage by the end of the year?

So when dealing with ERC tokens you need eth or gas to send them (which is really annoying when you need $1 of eth to send your tokens but have to send a small amount to that wallet first in order to move the funds). Is there a way we could program something automatically in the background that could atomic swap KMD into eth for that micro gas payment? I constantly end up with dust balances of eth everywhere needing it to send my erc üí© coins around.

Shapeshift or others doesn't even blink at you for a swap of 1 KMD. minimum is about 40 everywhere

but if there's demand we can do our own, not sure if it'll worth for you to pay the gas to receive it + take the margin of the LP

Can atomicdex be used as a decentralized crypto custodian? Send BTC to aBTC (ETH). Holds the BTC in a contract that executes when the used wants to redeem aBTC? aBTC gets burned when trade for BTC.

can someone tell me why the difference in vrsc on A/DEX pro and coingecko,


[05-Jun-20 02:26 PM] Oszy#5734
because the price isn't from coingecko in aDex


[05-Jun-20 02:26 PM] Oszy#5734
it's from coinpaprika


[05-Jun-20 02:26 PM] paco#7277
oh rite ok, so coinpaprika is real price


[05-Jun-20 02:28 PM] paco#7277
its showing me on A/DEX pro vrsc is 10c, but on the beta its 8.5c

Some times it hard to know if so orders where bought or removed allows one to gauge market sentiment

Actually a chart solves this

Hi @Oszy! I guess this should be added to API for easier handling, `is_mine` field in orderbook method response will do the trick I guess. https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/669, will do on this week since it requires minor changes of API code.

A user has reported me this:


If I want to trade Dash via AtomicDEX, a transaction fee of 100 times the necessary fee is indicated.  Would it be possible to change this?  I understand that it makes sense to set the transaction fee a bit higher than necessary to avoid delays, but I find 100 times the amount a bit exaggerated considering that the blocks are almost never full and even if they are full, you could get in with 2 times the amount without any problems.


[09-Jun-20 12:58 AM] jansako#3330
Can you ask them to fill out the survey? One of the features on the list was a custom fee capability. I expect the more people mark it the higher priority it gets.
AFAIK it cannot be done now via the UI, not sure the CLI...


[09-Jun-20 02:13 AM] Audo#5667
The fee adjustment feature is already in AtomicDEX, at least in the normal send function. I just saw it today


[09-Jun-20 02:13 AM] Oszy#5734
on withdraw yes, but not on swaps üôÇ


[09-Jun-20 02:19 AM] Audo#5667
I see. For most pairs I think we could just review the fees and ensure they are on a sane level, but for swaps that need ETH as gas it might be a different story. I don't actually know how the etomic swaps take the gas market in consideration. It's a good question


[09-Jun-20 02:27 AM] Oszy#5734
obviously it would be best for UTXO coins, and only when the automated fee is way off from what's required. 
changing it too low will result in a failed swap thus will cost you the takerfee

The one user is complaining that the fee on Dash is 100x to high for a swap


[09-Jun-20 02:39 AM] cipi#4502
DASH uses dynamic fees: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins/blob/master/coins#L556
so the fee used is what `estimatesmartfee 1` returns


[09-Jun-20 02:39 AM] jansako#3330
@ComputerGenie this is about the network fee, not the DEX fee... Unless the user is mistaking the DEX fee for Tx fee... In that case better messaging would be in order to let the user know what are they paying for.


[09-Jun-20 02:40 AM] jansako#3330

**QoL feature req:**
If I have ongoing swap and the trade button is greyed out because you don't have the amount, can you please change the text on the trade button, or put a message above/below saying how much is locked for swaps?

Morning folks! 
Question about KMD-ERC-20 swaps.
I understand that I need to have ETH for gas.
Will this gas fee be spent if my order executes as a 'maker' order? 
I have KMD. I want ETH.
In a maker order scenario, I send my KMD with the KMD network fee x2, and the Taker side pays the DEX Fee and Gas x2, is that correct?
If it is, that means I, as a maker will not be charged a Gas fee, correct?


[11-Jun-20 01:34 AM] TonyL#3577
Hi @jansako ! 
If taker buying ETH in that case he'll need gas for 1 tx: claiming of maker payment
maker also need to pay gas for single tx only  - maker payment sending

However if taker buying KMD with ETH he'll need gas for taker fee sending, then gas for taker payment sending. Maker will need gas for taker payment claiming


[11-Jun-20 01:35 AM] jansako#3330
So everyone now needs gas & tx fees for one transaction?


[11-Jun-20 01:36 AM] jansako#3330
In essence you cannot buy any coin you already do not have, correct?


[11-Jun-20 01:37 AM] jansako#3330
@tony I think you actually described every other scenario than the one I was asking for üôÇ


[11-Jun-20 01:37 AM] gcharang#6833
"you cannot buy **ETH/ERC20** if you already do not have ETH"


[11-Jun-20 01:37 AM] jansako#3330
I have KMD. 
I want ETH. 
I am Maker.
What is my ETH fee for?


[11-Jun-20 01:39 AM] gcharang#6833
I think it is for claiming the taker payment from the contract. better wait for tony to answer

OK, thanks!


[11-Jun-20 01:53 AM] jansako#3330
I was trying to think about removing the barrier of entry that is the 'no Eth in my wallet'... 
I know similar questions have been asked, but would it be possible to have a built-in service similar to the 'Pirate Onboarding' where is a user sends a certain amount of KMD to an address, they will receive ETH back? 

It could be just a button in the DEX UI 'Get ETH for GAS'. 
Picking it would pop-up a dialog: 'Send 1 KMD and receive X ETH for Gas.'. (No idea if 1 KMD worth of gas is enough...)

The price in KMD would be whatever it needs to be to cover the gas fees of sending the ETH back to the user. 

Call it the price of convenience. 

I for sure would have used it today. I do not want to log in to a separate wallet, send my ETH etc... My time is worth more in $ terms than what the service would charge.


[11-Jun-20 01:54 AM] gcharang#6833
> where is a user sends a certain amount of KMD to an address, they will receive ETH back? 
best bet is for the gui to integrate shapeshift/changenow ...


[11-Jun-20 01:54 AM] jansako#3330
I know the argument before was that you still need gas fees, but what if we just bake the cost of that gas into the cost of the service? If it needs to be 'send 5 KMD to get enough Gas for a transaction, that would still be worth...


[11-Jun-20 01:57 AM] jansako#3330
Integrating a 3rd party service is OK, as long as it is under the hood all the way, the user does not need to see unnecessary pop-ups/disclaimers/etc 'Now you are going to another page we are not responsible for this service' - kinda thing.


[11-Jun-20 01:58 AM] TonyL#3577
> I have KMD.

It‚Äôs for ‚Äúclaiming of taker payment‚Äù transaction to swap smart contract


[11-Jun-20 01:59 AM] jansako#3330
Got it, thanks.


[11-Jun-20 01:59 AM] TonyL#3577
Unfortunately there is no simple solution to resolve that


[11-Jun-20 02:00 AM] jansako#3330
Otherwise it would have been solved a long time ago I suppose üôÇ

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[11-Jun-20 02:03 AM] jansako#3330
To conclude, I was really asking for an easy button integration into the UI. If that means Shapeshift or whatever, that is less important than the user only seeing the 'easy button' to get the gas fees. Will this be an issue with other protocol integrations as well?


[11-Jun-20 02:04 AM] TonyL#3577
It‚Äôs very vary of exact protocol actually


[11-Jun-20 02:04 AM] gcharang#6833
might be the same for qtum as well. they implement ETH VM in a utxo chain


[11-Jun-20 02:05 AM] TonyL#3577
For QTUM tokens transactions QTUM is needed yeah


[11-Jun-20 02:07 AM] TonyL#3577
@jansako yeah it‚Äôs possible solution but it‚Äôs not in priority at the moment to improve ETH/ERC swaps experience because there are some more global things needed to be solved first


[11-Jun-20 02:08 AM] jansako#3330
There is probably not enough money in it, but it really sounds like an opportunity...
- Have a wallet full of Eth
- Have a web-service keeping track of ETH fees & price of KMD & ETH
- If a KMD payment arrives to a my KMD address, send the corresponding amount of ETH back to the originating address (I can 'translate' what the ERC address is from a KMD-type address right?)
What am I missing?


[11-Jun-20 02:08 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe they‚Äôll release ETH2.0 meanwhile üòÖ


[11-Jun-20 02:08 AM] Oszy#5734
Why not the taker pays that too? not possible?


[11-Jun-20 02:09 AM] Oszy#5734
cus the maker wouldn't be able to spend it?


[11-Jun-20 02:09 AM] TonyL#3577
Yeah afaik it‚Äôs not possible at the moment to pay gas fee for somebody else


[11-Jun-20 02:09 AM] Oszy#5734
i see


[11-Jun-20 02:09 AM] TonyL#3577

@jansako  it doesn‚Äôt sound like a simple solution,  in general simplier will be if ETH will add into protocol possibility to pay gas fee by contract


[11-Jun-20 02:10 AM] jansako#3330
I see, they are just matching orders.


[11-Jun-20 02:11 AM] gcharang#6833
> So all CEX's are
yes, depends on how serious usa takes crypto and how long their arm reaches


[11-Jun-20 02:12 AM] jansako#3330
@TonyL I wasn't looking for simple, of course simple is if someone else builds the tools & you just implement. I was looking for 'workable' at this point.


[11-Jun-20 02:13 AM] jansako#3330
@gcharang that is kinda a showstopper right there.


[11-Jun-20 02:13 AM] gcharang#6833
so, the most an official KMD GUI will support is a shapeshift/changenow integration
ofc, a 3rd party GUI can implement the exact ETH/KMD swap service you described


[11-Jun-20 02:15 AM] TonyL#3577
processing service integration into GUI for this sounds like a reasonable solution on that point


[11-Jun-20 02:15 AM] jansako#3330
agreed.


[11-Jun-20 02:17 AM] TonyL#3577
After app mature from alpha to solid beta I think we might consider that


[11-Jun-20 02:19 AM] jansako#3330
This should be in before mass-marketing for entry level users, so probably last beta before the full public release at the latest?


[11-Jun-20 02:19 AM] TonyL#3577
I would say not many users trade ETH at the moment


[11-Jun-20 02:19 AM] TonyL#3577
And such swaps quite expensive


[11-Jun-20 02:19 AM] jansako#3330
LP's would not care, people 'just trying this crypto thing' would.


[11-Jun-20 02:20 AM] TonyL#3577
I mean trades in AtomicDEX


[11-Jun-20 02:20 AM] jansako#3330
I think you would be surprised if you check the last week or so


[11-Jun-20 02:20 AM] jansako#3330

Might be good to add my 2c in this channel in relation to the survey. @TonyL do you know where the LP tool features is at currently? Without liquidity you wont get users so it is the most important thing we need to have.

[11-Jun-20 04:17 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Have people been looking at this? We should not be trying to add any features until this is a flat line


[11-Jun-20 04:21 AM] jansako#3330
Not sure why flat line... the daily totals as so small that just a few swaps more or less will make the line jump...


[11-Jun-20 04:22 AM] jansako#3330
The LP vs 'General user' has been discussed ad nauseam lately. I 'think' the (team) consensus currently is that 'genpop' is the main target audience with added features aimed at 'advanced user (LP).


[11-Jun-20 04:24 AM] jansako#3330
Those two have such different needs that I think the app almost needs to have two modes to satisfy both groups, but those are general level design decisions that the project lead needs to make.


[11-Jun-20 04:25 AM] jansako#3330
Everything else feature-wise then follows from the above.


[11-Jun-20 04:53 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@jansako yeah not really a good sample size either way, it should be flat lining to give us a indication that it is stable, but as i discussed with artem, it is relative. (mobile users will have more failures vs CLI users etc, but we should be able to do tests to get baselines etc)


[11-Jun-20 04:54 AM] hyperDEX#6586
This should not be a discussion of either building the DEX for LP or general users. Without LP there is no general users and without general users, there would be not enough profit for LPs


[11-Jun-20 04:56 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I am not talking about building out  feature sets only for 1 or the other but give the LP enough tools to be able to make a profit, give the general user enough functionality for a shiftswap or basic maker/taker functionality and we iterate from that


[11-Jun-20 05:00 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Planning for just general users and giving them what they would like is missing the point of why they need to use a DEX in the first place. They want to make a simple exchange from 1 coin to another. If we have no LP or lack of LPs, they cannot do the most important aspect of a EX


[11-Jun-20 05:04 AM] hastrup#8742
üëÜ I like the name shiftswap, but overall I couldn't agree more, that is exactly what I I'm thinking to

That is one way of doing it but they need to see the $$$$$$


[11-Jun-20 05:07 AM] hyperDEX#6586
One way of doing that is the CEX integrations


[11-Jun-20 05:09 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But it is a chicken and egg problem. The users wont come because there is no liquidity, there is no liquidity because of a lack of users. Stability of the system holds up both.


[11-Jun-20 05:11 AM] hyperDEX#6586
We need to be playing 3 dimensional chess here, get user stories written up about the LP and the general user and see where they intersect, then work backwards to see what the minimal feature set is required to get both in the quickest amount of time.


[11-Jun-20 05:12 AM] cipi#4502
i run my own bot on AtomicDEX, Binance, Coinex and Crex24... and i rebalance manually from time to time... or change the spread in case i need more BTC or more KMD or whatever... works fine...
all the swaps where `maker_gui` is `mpm` are done with that...
but no gui and stuff üôÇ


[11-Jun-20 05:14 AM] cipi#4502
what i need the most atm as a marketmaker is listing of AtomicDEX on coinpaprika... because that is where i get my prices from... and there are coins, like VRSC, where the volume is higher on AtomicDEX than on CEXes... so the price i get from coinpaprika is not the real one...

How about there is an basic and advanced toggel. And on basic (shapeshift like feature) there are only small amounts of pairs that "komodo/atomicdex" garanti a certain volume or most likely to be filled


[11-Jun-20 05:26 AM] hastrup#8742
I would be easier to provide LP for a small amount of pairs


[11-Jun-20 05:29 AM] cipi#4502
you mean by doing near real time arbitrage between AtomicDEX and some CEXes? That is problematic... you have the high withdraw fees on CEX side (at least for BTC, ETH and all ERC20 tokens) and than you also have the problem of confirmation times on deposits... and small amounts are problematic anyways because of the txfees (at least on BTC and ERC20) ;-)
regarding real-time-arbitrage: https://www.pionex.com/en-US/fund/home
so there are people who started to "solve" this issues... but some problems are only solvable by merging the funds/withdraws of many users together


[11-Jun-20 05:29 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I think there should be 3 different users:

1. General user
2. Advanced user / GUI LP 
3. Advanced LP / no GUI


[11-Jun-20 05:32 AM] hastrup#8742
I think we just put most of our efforts in 1 and 3


[11-Jun-20 05:32 AM] hyperDEX#6586
We can do all 3


[11-Jun-20 05:32 AM] hyperDEX#6586
With the API, 3 is already an option


[11-Jun-20 05:32 AM] cipi#4502
AtomicDEX-Pro can be the solution for 2


[11-Jun-20 05:32 AM] hyperDEX#6586
We need to focus on 1 & 2, basic trading functionality and basic LP functionality


[11-Jun-20 05:35 AM] cipi#4502
actually, AtomicDEX-Pro IS the solution for 2, when i look at the swaps done with it as a maker
it uses `MM2GUI` as gui-setting... @Slyris maybe you want to change this to something else like `atomicDEX Pro 0.1.4` or so


[11-Jun-20 05:40 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Is there 2 different apps to cater for general and LPs?


[11-Jun-20 05:46 AM] hastrup#8742
My 2c is you don't get general user adoption if you have advanced features. You get that with flawless gui that is simple and easy to understand. So who is the target audience for atomicdex?


[11-Jun-20 05:51 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@hastrup you do by hiding the features under the hood


[11-Jun-20 05:52 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I can see a basic user mode, deposit coins, swap from 1 to another. Advanced mode lets you do some basic LP stuff (hook your client into CEX (BTC/KMD pair etc) and offer their pricebook on the DEX) + margin


[11-Jun-20 05:54 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Targeting general users will only result in takers, so unless the team wants to be the makers, it would have to cater to both types of users


[11-Jun-20 06:15 AM] jansako#3330
I made a breakdown of basic user workflows (what some call "user stories") on the private group channel for whoever here is a member.
https://community.komodoplatform.com/post/breakdown-of-workflows-for-next-version-of-atomixdex-targeted-to-a-genpop-userba--5ed0f90475bc813d1819daae
 I could do a similar write-up applicable to LP users if it would be interesting for the team. For now it seems the KMD team is going more for a 'feature-centric' approach to design. I could be wrong, of course, I can only tell form what I see posted.


[11-Jun-20 06:21 AM] hastrup#8742
@hyperDEX  i get that and totally agree. The Issue I'm a rasing is what the time should be focused on. Let's say there is 10 dev, 9 is using its time on advanced features 1 making basics function better. I hope it not that, we are doing. What do I know  I'm not a dev

@hyperDEX The liquidity problem is something that needs to be solved after solving the scalability problem - it's on the roadmap but at the moment after current tech out of beta. In general, API is quite simple to use so maybe when it's marketed interested parties will make their own solutions/bridges to bots.

I agree that stability and scaleability is what is needed first but we dont want to be fixing one problem without thinking about what the next move is going to be.

Anything possible. Whitelist KYC for atomic dex will be done by pk. 

Antara and the dex are different codebases.  You can write a whitelist pk filter in antara, store them in an index or oracle. Ofc these need to be developed

> suggestion, a feature like in crypto.com where all funds that are to small to exchange could be swap for DEX or KMD maybe
yeah thats good suggestion@paco, however the problem is that it's real funds on blockchain - not records in DB as in CEX case. So in most of the cases user will need to spend sum proportional to this dust amount just in tx fees to send it in such swap


[17-Jun-20 10:23 AM] paco#7277
i see,


[17-Jun-20 10:43 AM] paco#7277
in the case of me giving away a small amount of btc that i cant trade with is the fees the same or less than an exchange or swap


[17-Jun-20 10:47 AM] cipi#4502
the fee depends only on the size of the tx in bytes and the network fee at the moment when do you the tx
the size of the tx depends on the number of inputs and ouputs... outputs would be one, but the number of inputs can be anything


[17-Jun-20 10:48 AM] cipi#4502
so it does not depend on the value you send... could be 1$, could be 1 Million, if the $1 has a bigger size, it will cost more fees


[17-Jun-20 10:51 AM] cipi#4502
btw, https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/1JsAjr6d21j9T8EMsYnQ6GXf1mM523JAv1 shows the number of utxos of the address... so this one has "Unspent output count" 4... if i would send the entire amount, it would have 4 inputs


[17-Jun-20 10:51 AM] paco#7277
rite ok, i get ya, im new so i was learing the ropes on a/dex, iv a small amount of btc that i cant trade with, i was trying to think what else could be done with these small amounts, like a bot like system where we could deposit these small amounts and get amount back in kmd


[17-Jun-20 10:53 AM] cipi#4502
if you continue to use this address for further trading, this small amounts will be used up by AtomicDEX automagically... it tends to reduce the amount of utxos in your address over time, so it will consolidate such small amounts...

{Reactions}
üëçüèª 

[17-Jun-20 10:58 AM] cipi#4502
the above address is from a AtomicDEX maker node... and if you look closely at the tx that have been done, you will see that selling BTC (sending to other addresses) reduces the amount of utxos, like here: https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/b312cef63ed20a8b0654f616d057a53ea8a731e9ff45d66fdb2904c50b5526a9 (it used 3 utxos from this address and "generated" a new one because of thh change, but it made 1 utxo out of 3)
and when it receives BTC (selling some other coins for BTC), the utxo number always increases by one


[17-Jun-20 11:00 AM] cipi#4502
and one of the inputs (utxos) was only `0.00008831`... sending this amount in a single tx could have costed more fees than the amount itself, but using this in a bigger tx as one additional input is more "clever"... i would say

[21-Jun-20 08:56 AM] tolken#2655
I'm trying to monitor trade progress via MM2 cli. If I want to monitor when a 'taker' trade is effectively done (funds received) is minotiring the UUID.json files in the MY directory the best way to do this? Is watching the "success events" dictionary item and waiting for "TakerPaymentSpent" the best way to determine if a trade is more or less done for a taker? Is that how those files work, if anything is in the "success events", it means that item is "True"?


[21-Jun-20 09:11 AM] Sir Seven#7158
@tolken Usual flow of successful events is: `'TakerPaymentSpent'-> 'MakerPaymentSpent'-> 'Finished'`
No matter maker or taker, I would recommend you to wait for `'Finished'` event.
You can check UUID.json files or poll mm2 via RPC:
https://docs.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.html#my-swap-status


[21-Jun-20 09:15 AM] Sir Seven#7158
>>` if anything is in the "success events", it means that item is "True"?`
If anything goes wrong, you will get one of `error_events`, you can check 'em in docs (link above) or in RPC json response.


[21-Jun-20 09:32 AM] cipi#4502
`success_events`and `error_events` in the json are just a list of all possible events for that node (maker differs from taker)
you can loop through all events that actually happened (not this 2 lists) and search for `TakerPaymentSpent` (on maker) and `MakerPaymentSpent` (on taker)... but then there are also the swaps that got refunden automatically... so you will only find swaps that finished normally


[21-Jun-20 09:37 AM] tolken#2655
So both of these lists (success_events and error_events) aren't dynamic, they just list all possibile errors? Where would I look to watch where the swap is in its sequence then?


[21-Jun-20 09:38 AM] cipi#4502
yes, true... the json-file of the swap is updated as the swap progresses... haven't looked at the API output from my_recent_swaps, i guess it does the same


[21-Jun-20 09:43 AM] tolken#2655
Ok, I'm not sure if I understand, but it sounds like something in the .json gets updated to show the state, I'm not sure what, gets updated that shows the progress. I need to watch for "finished" (assuming it isn't just already there as a list of all possible events...) and that should be it. Is monitoring the "MY" directory correct? I believe someone said the TAKER/MAKER directories aren't necessarily swaps for trades I'm involved with.


[21-Jun-20 09:46 AM] cipi#4502
yes, the jsons are in /SWAPS/MY/... i don't know which TAKER/MAKER directory... that only applies to the seed nodes, they have both jsons (maker and taker), but that's another story
each event will be added to the json as it happens... the file grows bigger...


[21-Jun-20 09:48 AM] tolken#2655
The only thing that has "TakerPaymentSpent" for example, is in the succes_events. I think thats where I'm a little confused. It seems like it's being said that these are just a list of all possible errors, which gives me the impression that when the file is generated at the start of a trade, "TakerPaymentSpent" is already there, even though that event hasn't happened. I'll just start monitoring it and see what I can find üòÑ


[21-Jun-20 09:48 AM] cipi#4502
`Finished` does not mean successfull... this event only indicates that mm2 does not do anything with this swap any mor automatically... eg waiting for txes, waiting for locktime to expire to be able to refund or whatever


[21-Jun-20 09:49 AM] tolken#2655
Yes, that was my impression - thats why I was thinking the MakerPaymentSpent was a more valid way of making that determination, as you were mentioning.


[21-Jun-20 09:49 AM] cipi#4502
yes, the list is just here so you can see what events are possible... that can change if mm2 gets updated and new stuff is being introduced, therefore they are written to each and every swap json


[21-Jun-20 09:50 AM] cipi#4502
yes, if `MakerPaymentSpent` is an event in the json of a taker, this swap was 100% successfull


[21-Jun-20 09:51 AM] tolken#2655
awesome, thank you cipi and Sir Steven - i'll give this a shot and see how ti works for myself before thinking about it too much more.


[21-Jun-20 09:54 AM] tolken#2655
I only mentioned the TAKER/MAKER directories because some apparently out-dated documents talks about placing uuid.json files recovered from AtomicDex-moble logs should be placed in those folders (when attempting to recover lost funds), rather than the MY. According to gcharang may be incorrect and docs may need revising.


[21-Jun-20 10:32 AM] Sir Seven#7158
I would still suggest polling API (my_swaps_status call).
Also, just to clear possible confusion on events, the response structure is:
```json
{
  "result": {
    "error_events": ["List of possible error events for maker or taker swaps"],
    "events": ["List of actual events happening, latest event here describes actual swap status, if there are any error_event in here -> swap failed"],
    ...
    "success_events": ["List of possible success events"],
    "type": "Taker or Maker - swap type",
    "uuid": "UUID"
    }
}
```

Got it thanks! so events is what I want! I‚Äôll try the RPC method. I think it was frowned upon in mm1 to call via RPC, or maybe some other reason, but with mm1 I was monitoring by scanning the uuid files, but if querying via RPC is reliable/efficient to do somewhat frequently, I‚Äôll try that first.

@Sir Seven The MM2 process is started only after the login stage, not before !


[03-Jul-20 01:05 AM] Slyris#2880
There is a log that is made at the very beginning of the program to see if the logger works, it would be very suspicious not to even arrive at this stage. (This is one of the first line of code)

I've noticed something in the Atomicdex-pro that when I place an order I see a lot of fees requested like 0.0005666 btc + 0.006 eth and also DEX fees. I know that DEX fees are only paid by taker. What about the other fees?


[11-Jul-20 02:39 PM] uak#6718
if he will transfer ETH to me why I should pay for it's fees?


[11-Jul-20 09:02 PM] gcharang#6833
@uak if the trade involves ETH or ERC20 tokens, both maker and taker need to pay gas fees to activate the smart contract when it is their turn. that's the reality of the ETH system and there is nothing we can do about it üò¶


[12-Jul-20 02:58 AM] jansako#3330
To put it simply, the other side is not sending ETH to you, they are sending it to a contract address (so they pay the fee). Then your DexPro tells the contract to send the ETH (or ERC token) to you, for which you must pay the tx fee. The BTC-type coins use a different method and so you do not have to have BTC to get BTC.

The antara tokens module has it's own on-chain dex. Not compatible with atomic dex cross chain protocol, currently.

@Mylo @Lennart tokenised BTC/ETH created on a Smart Chain using gateways are not directly compatible with atomic swaps. But pegged BTC or ETH created through the Pegs module will be directly compatible. Pegs is still in dev and testing though

@uak ETH GAS fee was charged for the Trade Fee, and for the Transaction, it is not worth swapping ETH for such small amounts, it's a flaw of ETH

@uak correct, ETH/ERC20 swaps requires multiple ETH transactions from taker: 1) Taker fee sending 2) Taker payment sending 3) Maker payment claiming from SC if maker payment is in ETH/ERC20

2 observations for dev... 1. Pro QRs still wont scan in many of my apps... Like I cant use Coinbase or Bitpay for example to scan the generated QR in aDEX Pro... just refuses to capture on a Pixel 4.


[18-Jul-20 10:01 AM] daemonfox#6136
2. When clicking the copy button to manually capture the address... at times it adds weird padding


[18-Jul-20 10:01 AM] daemonfox#6136
This time I got 2 extra spaces padded at the start of my key


[18-Jul-20 10:01 AM] daemonfox#6136
Last time it was 1 extra space at the end of the key


[18-Jul-20 10:02 AM] daemonfox#6136
After pasting in notepad or anywhere you notice the spaces or if pasting into another app, it rejects the paste wholly.


[18-Jul-20 10:33 AM] Slyris#2880
Hey @daemonfox, that's true, i just tried to scan with my phone, but i'm unable to scan on my coinbase account.

But the copy paste using the `copy` icon works well for me.


[18-Jul-20 11:28 AM] Slyris#2880

@daemonfox Absolutely not, i'm the lead dev of aDex pro

Just curious


[18-Jul-20 11:43 AM] Slyris#2880

Pretty sure we just broke testnet again lol


[18-Jul-20 11:44 AM] Slyris#2880
Regarding the infrastructure change you probably want to ask @artem.pikulin about VRSC change if it's supported in `MM2`, if it's supported, it's will automatically work in aDex pro


[18-Jul-20 11:44 AM] daemonfox#6136
The Token portion likely will


[18-Jul-20 11:44 AM] daemonfox#6136
They will be mined by VRSC blocks moving


[18-Jul-20 11:44 AM] daemonfox#6136
The next round adds mineable chains to it


[18-Jul-20 11:45 AM] daemonfox#6136
So the Tokens likely will be viewable in the same way ERC20 tokens are


[18-Jul-20 11:45 AM] daemonfox#6136
Eventually they will exist on Verus mainnet

I am trying to get AtomicDex Pro compiled from source in Ubuntu 18.04.  I figured out that I needed to get a newer CMake than is normally installed, and that I had to git clone vcpkg, but I am stuck on /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lc++abi.  I installed the c++abi package, and added it to dependencies.nim, but don't have any ideas on how to move forward.  Any ideas?


[21-Jul-20 09:50 AM] gcharang#6833
@linkbelt this guide was written some time ago <https://docs.komodoplatform.com/qa/atomicDEX-PRO/build.html> it might still help you. @Slyris or @naezith-work can help you with compilation troubles


[21-Jul-20 09:52 AM] Slyris#2880
hey @linkbelt `sudo apt-get install libc++abi-dev` should solve the problem for Linux


[21-Jul-20 09:53 AM] Slyris#2880
On windows, GTest, jsoncpp are not needed in `dependencies.nim` because it's just a warning


[21-Jul-20 09:54 AM] Slyris#2880
vcpkg is a submodule in the repository, so the step during the clone is: `git clone https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Pro.git --recurse-submodules`


[21-Jul-20 09:58 AM] Slyris#2880
There is typical file that describe the list of dependencies depending of your platform if you want: `https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Pro/blob/dev/.github/workflows/windows_response_file.txt`

Hi everyone. Are you guys aware that last week the first high standard private stablecoin was released? It‚Äôs xUSD and comes from burning XHV. All with monero grade privacy. This could be huge and I believe it should be listed in AtomicDex.

monero itself isn't supported currently. the last time we investigated, monero was missing some methods that would allow atomic swaps. not sure if the situation changed. integrating monero or similar protocol coins needs a combined effort by both our devs and theirs

i sent over some verus coin from verus desktop wallet to atomicdex nut it does not show up for some reason


[29-Jul-20 11:49 PM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
Universal first step: Check the originating & destination addresses on the explorer for the transaction. It'll give a clue which of the wallets causes this issue.


[30-Jul-20 04:29 AM] LC#8415
Ok


[30-Jul-20 04:29 AM] LC#8415
What do you mean


[30-Jul-20 04:51 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
In any case of a transaction between two addresses not showing up, the explorer of that chain will provide info whether that transaction is 
a) visible on the chain
b) sent to the address you intended
- If it is not visible on the chain: start diagnosing in the sending wallet why not.
- If it is visible: check to see if it was sent to the intended address
- if it was sent to the intended address: start diagnosing the wallet that uses that address.

This way you specify the problem. It's too general right now.


[30-Jul-20 08:39 AM] banksy35#0477
Looking Awesome, couple of suggestion.  Apologies if already suggested.  On the Dex screen, in the Receive amount: field.  There should be an option to Auto populate the price from the Third party source.  This would recalculate when the sell amount field changes.

@Deleted User The connection policy will change in the next version, you will be able to use the application with a vpn/proxyserver, if the vpn support atleast one of the endpoint. If you are not able to reach electrum servers, unfortunately you will not be able to use the application correctly

> Later on a portfolio tab with pie chart would be good.  Also, on windows 10 the app's doesn't dock to fill half the screen it fills 2 thirds.
@banksy35 it has a minimum width so ther is no scroll and the charts arent scewed and distorted


[30-Jul-20 03:57 PM] daemonfox#6136
Minimize it to its smallest and even then it should be almost 2/3 wide of a typical desktop


[30-Jul-20 03:58 PM] daemonfox#6136
You would need to drop the Windows desktop UI scale for it to fit half


[30-Jul-20 03:59 PM] daemonfox#6136
at 125% it fit half for me


[31-Jul-20 04:25 AM] jansako#3330
> Also, on windows 10 the app's doesn't dock to fill half the screen it fills 2 thirds.
@banksy35 What do you mean 'dock to fill half the screen'? I believe the expected behavior is maximize = whole screen, 'unmaximize' = return to original window size. There is a default minimum size as well, how big it is for you would depend on your monitor size & display scaling.


[31-Jul-20 05:04 AM] banksy35#0477
I think Microsoft call it 'drag and snap', where you drag the window to the left and generally it spans half the screen.  I had a think about what you and daemonfox said and I think it makes sense.  If it screws up the graph's then best to default to minimum size like it is.  I'm new to Komodo I will go through all the documentation and try to learn more, thanks for the interest.

So it cant snap to half


[31-Jul-20 08:34 AM] daemonfox#6136
It snaps to min width


[31-Jul-20 08:35 AM] daemonfox#6136
Its less a "fix" and more a personal local setting... aDEX pro might have to embed a scroll bar to meet all width snap half calcs


[31-Jul-20 08:37 AM] daemonfox#6136
Only other thing I can think of is making the graph render in a manner that allows custom on the fly UI scaling.

Which would need the entire window to UI scale itslef outside the desktop UI scale

Today the #ETC chain experienced a chain reorg of 3693 blocks at block 10904146. This caused all state pruned nodes to stop syncing. It is likely caused by a 51% attack and all exchanges are advised to halt deposits & withdrawals immediately and investigate all recent tx.

@TonyL Very nice, But I think it would look nicer by removing the buy /sell panel and reintgrating it at the bottom of the main panel just above the Exchange rate saction. And reducing that Buy/sell square panel into a Line panel.


[05-Aug-20 07:45 AM] TonyL#3577
Yeah, that was intitial idea, then we've decided to save a bit space for more widgets. Thanks for feedback:)


[05-Aug-20 07:53 AM] TonyL#3577
buy/sell part atm is similar to that widgets arrangement

This seems like taken from a Web app from a Cex, They are bit clutter y, I think you should follow your own design ,on How it looks better and less clutter y ,Yet have appropiate functionality. If your hands are not tied i think your initial design is something a Desktop app user will look for.Welcome.

Yeah, we'll adjust well-known for CEX-users things to make it more ordered/fit for DEX reality.
Thats a first attempt to go from more casual logic we got on mobile (where you need to click few times to see actuall orderbook) to more "Pro-like" logic where you see the whole market situation on single screen with dynamically refreshing pricing information and orderbooks.

Also what is I think is really good improvement there will be no need anymore to got balance to see orderbook - just coin needs to be activated (in future I think we'll be able to improve it even more to be able to see all orderbooks you interested in even without coins activation)

DexPro certainly needs a 'contact support' feature, perhaps starting with an email one would be good, or one that takes the user to the KMD support portal if that is preferable. Also really great improvement ideas often come through the customer feedback feature.

At what percent you getting blocked? or is it after finished downloading?Or Before?

If before its bcoz apple browser has not yet registered the product as trusted..ADEX is on alpha ,It will take some time for Browser and OS'es to list it on their database as trusted software.

My 2 cents, if it matters: colors are pale, fonts are small, too many rounded corners, overdoing drop shadows and glows

there was a design concept Steve posted a while ago that looked a lot better

Appimge is very good for Linux support ,One ring to rule them all. If ADEX is on appimage it will be easier to maintain support for all the distros. Dunno what the plan is though.


[06-Aug-20 03:04 AM] Slyris#2880
I believe @ca333 already give a full answer in November 2019 regarding appimage status, I don't know if any evolution are planned regarding this solution.

But I think you may not have seen how the bundling on linux was done from us, by the way i don't understand the creator of the tool that we are using to deploy that like this tweet because we use it in our deployment process: https://github.com/probonopd/linuxdeployqt

We just bypass the appimage binary step, but it's exactly the same binary with the same process as creating an appimage.

as the author say in his own repository just for quote him: `optionally generates an AppImage`


[06-Aug-20 06:32 AM] Slyris#2880
If you really absolutely want it, we can introduce an extra option in the `ci_tools` but it's will not be used by us in our CI environment, means it's will be your choice to bundle a linux appimage if you really want it.

Just to be clear, it's not being an `appimage` that makes your cross-linux program compatible, it's the whole process before that is done by this tool + The compilation flags of your program


[06-Aug-20 06:35 AM] Slyris#2880
The only difference that having an AppImage will bring you is the program icon in the task bar, and being able to launch it directly from the application search (moreover you need another external tool to allow that):

yes - we do not have the resources to run a full secure code review ref. appimagekit usage. Certainly a very comfortable tool if you bundle games, utility tools and other kind of **non-financial** software. I advise against usage of any unreviewed software concerning (decentralized) financial software. If you have issues running the app on linux plz let us know and we will fix the problem or assist you in fixing it.

in worst case, you'll need to download again whole KMD blockchain. If your wallet.dat got corrupted (maybe possible with beta branch of jl777 I don't know), an old copy can help you to retrieve coins present on old addresses


[06-Aug-20 03:44 PM] phm87#7395
Well, I have a good news, it seems that jl777:beta is very close to komodoplatform:master branch
<https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/compare/master...jl777:beta>
Only 2 lines related to another coin changes (marmarachain/MCL) and a new unused variable

Can you add a feature where one can place an order , but it remains when the individual is offline  and the order gets executed when the  person comes back online abit like a pause swap still the other part comes online or an option to live order book active this can be done with colour code like red and green circle next to order something of the sort to let traders know if the other party is online


[08-Aug-20 01:48 PM] mobipoi#5774
And then an option to exclude offline order


[08-Aug-20 02:35 PM] jansako#3330
The problem with that is how would 'the network' know that your wifi just died (to keep the order 'visible') instead of you cancelling an order. It would (probably) require centralized orderbooks which is kinda a no-go. 
Also, what is the point of seeing that 'someone posted an order some time ago but you can't trade with them cause they are offline'?


[08-Aug-20 02:36 PM] jansako#3330
Seems better to me the 'what you see is what you get' implementation.

Will Atomic Dex pro will allow all the  compatible able tokens to be atomic swap ready ? with just a few inputs , listing fees are redundant now, DEX volume is growing and the model is changing from pay us for volume to please use our DEX and bring i your community and volume uniswap is an example. Hope  there are no listing fees in Dex pro as they are becoming redundant over time to remain competitive it not a game of how much people can we bring in

This would be under an 'allow adding custom tokens', pretty sure it was on the feature wishlist, but I don't know what priority is the team giving it. At this point unfortunately due to the gas cost, trading any ETH-based tokens is only worth in large amounts


[09-Aug-20 11:36 AM] mobipoi#5774
Can Dev confirm the "allow adding of custom token" mean I can add any BTC or Eth erco based token on Adex and start trading

@actionslacks yes it's possible, someone has to run a seed node on a different netid and others can connect to it

@jspook16 most of them are the same but not all of them


[11-Aug-20 11:11 PM] actionslacks#4072
the killer app. why would you unload your giant bag of ltc on net id 0 when you could unload it on net id 1 w/o anyone in the ecosystem knowing? is it a flex? did the counterparty want it to be broadcasted? hmm


[11-Aug-20 11:19 PM] Oszy#5734
because to unload it on a different netid you need to convince a buyer/seller to set up a mm2 cli node with you
I doubt the person unloaded the ltc has deep knowledge of this üôÇ


[11-Aug-20 11:20 PM] Oszy#5734
it's was still a dex swap so it's just as "private" as any other swap on any netid. still showing on the explorer regardless.


[12-Aug-20 04:15 AM] TonyL#3577
you'll also need to spin seed node in that netid to which both maker and taker will connect and specifiy this node in maker/taker configs


[12-Aug-20 07:37 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
if a whitelabel dex with kyc used a different net ID, for regulatory compliance to keep their orders separate from non kyc dex, is it still possible to join their liquidity pool or bridge in to their liquidity pool? As in, is it possible to use a hidden net ID? Or can users just scan net IDs to see who is trading on what channel? Then adjust their net ID accordingly


[12-Aug-20 08:18 AM] smkhound#7640
if they are doing kyc, probably will have something like registered address whitelist for use on that netid. If you were signed up to their service, you could run it alongside AtomicDEX or mm2 with another netid (and rpc port)


[12-Aug-20 01:58 PM] Regnar#6164
While I don't like, or think it's smart to give your desktop keys to your mobile phone, I think the syncing function might be pretty cool to have watch only addresses/portfolio tracking

@Slyris @bfresh makes a good point. Other coins need to have the coins added in github as you need to specify coin params etc, but for Eth ERC20, could users add in their coins manually to trade? Sure it means that people will have to manually add in in but if this could be done, someone could create the token and have people trading it within a few minutes of each other.

You tipped @bfresh **1 KMD**


[15-Aug-20 09:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
@bfresh there are market maker bots that will be launched in the future. This will give the little guy/girl the tools to connect to a CEX and be able to make some (relatively risk free) money automatically. Also one thing that you may have missed is the liquidity multiplier. This means your 300 KMD could be used in as many trades as you want without it being locked, until one of the trade executes. Say you use your 300 KMD over 100 open trades, you have basically increased liquidity 100x (30000 KMD) what you can on a CEX.


[15-Aug-20 09:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
@Slyris is there a way to measure the open trades/liquidity on the DEX? Maybe a good metric to see the liquidity on it.

Looking good. Do you know how long it would get to a point where there is a easy interface to connect to a CEX Api and buy/sell with a set margin whilst buying/selling as required to lock that in?


[15-Aug-20 10:14 PM] Slyris#2880
Either connecting an existing API as a binance does not take a lot of time, what takes a lot of time is the architecture if we want it to be easy to maintain and scale.

My initial goal is to make a program in another language that would be directly launched and controlled by the GUI user interface. You choose your strategy in the user interface, currencies, margins etc and behind that control the other program which is also connected to MM2 with the same rpc passphrase.

You have to imagine that it will take a while to even write the logic of such a program so that everything is well organized (and a lot of unit testing)

@Deleted User


[15-Aug-20 10:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yep that would be a project in itself.


[15-Aug-20 10:20 PM] Slyris#2880
Exactly, ofc we can start with something very small, like the issue above


[15-Aug-20 10:20 PM] Slyris#2880
Connecting CEX can come after


[15-Aug-20 10:21 PM] Slyris#2880
But yeah basically through the GUI you will connect your API keys, stuff like that


[15-Aug-20 10:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
Maybe another good addition, similar to the above, but could the DEX orders just follow what price on the exchange instead of a static order?


[15-Aug-20 10:23 PM] Slyris#2880
Well for that, we need to add exchange price fetching etc, but we already have an expedient widget right now, i don't know if you try it yet ?

[15-Aug-20 10:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
This type of logic

[15-Aug-20 10:29 PM] Slyris#2880
Yeah this is bot logic


[15-Aug-20 10:29 PM] Slyris#2880
Anyway, the fun fact is, if the external bot program place an order or close it, you will immediatly see the reflection into the GUI

So I managed to fat-finger a KMD/DEX trade today. I am not moaning about that, s**t happens. I accidentally set a trade to sell 101 KMD for 5 DEX (I intended to sell 101 KMD for DEX @5KMD üôÇ ). The trade matched, as you can imagine. I ended up receiving 5.6 DEX for my 101 KMD. 
My question: There are many sell orders between the 12-18 KMD range, including one of mine for ~14 KMD. Why did it match the one for 18? Surely my own order should have been the one with the smallest latency and like I said there were other orders for a far better price than the 18 KMD/Dex I got.

Just noticed message. Sorry about your unwanted trade. Will re-check current behaviour for buy/sell calls in such situations. For buy call mm2 should use best price if I remember correct 

upd: just checked, buy call matching best price, sell call can match any price level order and sell call using in 0.2.0 for trades. might be a bug, need to confirm with @artem.pikulin

Here is a link to the Verus Coin import creator, but likely the MCL team would need to create an import file if MCL isn't already in the wallet. Once an import file is created, it can be added to Verus Desktop.

We should have a way to visualize the "liquidity multiplier" effect, ie. show that the same coins can be used to place trades on multiple pairs at the same time. It's a powerful feature for a DEX, but it isn't really expressed or shown as a feature. The DEX just kinda allows you to do it, but I'm betting one of the UI/UX people can think of something cool that emphasizes this ability. Thoughts?

This has absolutely nothing to do with our confidence to release the new version of the project, every day we do our best to make the best product, I remind you that commits messages, open issues, project kanban can give you an indication of what we are working on at the moment. (all of this is open-source and accessible on the project's GitHub page of course). And for those who are really greedy, every day Continous Integration produces artifacts based on our development branch. (They are considered unstable, but can let you test the latest features, with RICK / MORTY for example)


[21-Aug-20 08:51 AM] jansako#3330
One can commit to a specific release date when your release cycle is 6 months, not when it is 2 weeks... and not in the middle of a UI redesign...

Characters overlap and the screen is difficult to see.

It was the cause of setting the screen size of the PC to 150% (recommended).
It was displayed normally when the screen size was set to 125%.

Is this a bug, or is 125% a requirement?
Hope to improve in future development if possible

depends on the blocktime and on the settings
if notarization for KMD is on (default), it takes till the KMD tx has been notarized, which can take 30 min

When atomicDEX is released will there be a way to set up long term buy and sell orders without running a VPS and arb bot plugged into an API?  

Basically will the everyday user be able to leave a buy or sell order up like you can on a CEX? 
If so how did this get solved?


[27-Aug-20 09:30 PM] Acura#2748

there is no middlemen that holding your order online


[27-Aug-20 11:01 PM] gcharang#6833
@Jcharming the best that can happen is, something like: user creates a AWS account, adds billing info, creates an API key with appropriate permissions and gives the key to a GUI. the GUI automatically creates a VPS, sets up mm2 on it, and talks to it as if it was running on the device itself. now, the user's mobile phone doesn't need to be online all the time and it won't need those sounds :D

but, this feature isn't a priority right now and it might be a long time before we see it

@gcharang thanks for helping to keep me updated.   So would you say the everyday user experience is going to be more-so to go on the AtomicDEX to buy from the market makers who take the time to list orders?


[28-Aug-20 05:15 AM] Regnar#6164
Or if you have the desktop version, just leaving it running in the background, just like I leave Spotify running lol. Probably just have a lock screen to prevent it from being reopened and accessed without a password, as well as an option to push it to a background process (no GUI) when you close the window, unless you explicitedly log out.


[28-Aug-20 05:21 AM] Regnar#6164
I suggested an idea a while back to try and address this for mobile users, where a user's desktop could host trade details and presigned txs for their mobile wallet. The other thing would be a VPS server/third party that can host trades for people if they opt to. 
<Https://discord.com/channels/412898016371015680/584762059430821909/742436657214783549>


[28-Aug-20 05:23 AM] Regnar#6164
I'm not sure how technically difficult it would be, feedback was that it would be tough, and also has security concerns, but it would be an interesting addition for sure. You could trade P2P or select a hosting party to host your order and broadcast signed transactions (this is the part I'm not sure of, I don't know if you can presign atomic swap transactions if the order isn't matched yet)


[28-Aug-20 06:31 AM] Jcharming#2693
Thanks @Regnar that's a lot of the info I was hoping to dig up. 
Leaving a desktop applicaation open in the background (or having a background process when you're a maker up) makes the most sense to me.  
A kind of dialogue box when you go to close atomicDEX that says 
`You have active trades looing for other parties, would you like atomicDEX to remain running in the background while these trades wait to execute?`


[28-Aug-20 06:31 AM] Jcharming#2693
I think that's a brilliant solution to the complicated issue of not being a CEX


[28-Aug-20 06:32 AM] Jcharming#2693
That's also a really interesting idea on the mobile -> desktop push for mobile trading

[28-Aug-20 11:22 AM] Regnar#6164
I think because the AtomicDEXerrr DeFi will actually have all other DeFi related projects inside it, like the dApps tab, it makes more sense to name the umbrella app DeFi related. 

For example, naming the app DEX, but then having DeFi projects and dApps within it confuses the idea of the main app. But calling it DeFi and then it has dApps, a DEX, etc. makes more sense


[28-Aug-20 11:23 AM] Regnar#6164
Like saying "I want to download X type of DeFi product." you wouldn't naturally move towards a product named DEX, even though it might have those products within it, it would feel almost secondary to the DEX and that isn't the goal


[28-Aug-20 11:45 AM] Jcharming#2693
That makes sense, and is there a way to solve brand-confusion with combining atomic+Defi to get into the DEFI space while dropping the name atomicDEX? 

As in download our Defi suite (or something that has it's own Defi name which is a set of Defi tools) 
within you'll find our atomicDEX project.


[28-Aug-20 11:54 AM] Jcharming#2693
Even if Komodo is a smaller project and KMD is a smaller cap coin it has claimed brand recognition with it's AtomicDEX, is social forums.  
A move like I would expect could cause deep confusion because so many people will never stop referring to it as AtomicDEX and when someone asks what's atomicDEFI and they are met with the answer of 'oh that's Komodo's atomicDEX but it also has a suite of tools now so they renamed it atomicDEFI' 


It's a very obfuscating point of 'is it a DEX with other Defi tools, or is it a DEFI suite with the atomicDEX in it?'  
In this sense I would consider  'atomic' belongs to the DEX that is being made and has long been being made and recognized as atomicDEX.  

Would there be a way to tack on the word 'Suite' to clarify that everything inside is an 'atomic' product? 

Download our atomicDEFI Suite - which is a set of DEFI tool.  
Inside you'll find the atomicDEX.


[28-Aug-20 11:58 AM] Jcharming#2693
I'm asking and critically checking in because I was just talking to @Audo about poking around and seeing if I should at this time share 2.0 with the beautiful GUI update to a set of investors (demographic number=50 age= 45+ looking for, and to be introduced to, a set of crypto related trading tools.  

They know this exclusivley as 'the atomicDEX'

@Regnar I think brand confusion is a very serious deal in this space.  It's also something close to me right now while Audo guides us through the internship I think.   I wanted to be sure to give voice to this, if the feedback was worthwhile.


[28-Aug-20 12:06 PM] Slyris#2880
Before (on 0.2.0 on the orderbook page there was 6 RPC CALL (http)):

- 2 get_max_taker_vol
- 1 orderbook
- 2 get fees

Now it's like one request in form on an array: `[get_max_taker_vol, get_max_taker_vol, orderbook, get_fees, get_fees]`


[28-Aug-20 12:07 PM] Slyris#2880

one interesting way would be to specify a list of tickers to coinpaprika and getting all the results into a single answer

And in the next version, all the RPC call will be async with the new http framework that we are experimenting


[28-Aug-20 12:08 PM] Regnar#6164
That's exactly what I suggested to them


[28-Aug-20 12:09 PM] Regnar#6164
We could also host our own API endpoints that is just a pass through, might be better in case they change their endpoints it wont break individual apps.


[28-Aug-20 12:10 PM] Regnar#6164
I'll follow up and see if they would add that endpoint


[28-Aug-20 12:10 PM] Slyris#2880
Yeah but you will loose precision with that


[28-Aug-20 12:10 PM] Slyris#2880
Because of the delay price updating etc


[28-Aug-20 12:10 PM] Regnar#6164
and it's probably slower anyway.


[28-Aug-20 12:10 PM] Slyris#2880
The best thing will be to not use coinpaprika at all but an oracle script result from a decentralized blockchain


[28-Aug-20 12:10 PM] Slyris#2880
This will be like that in the future


[28-Aug-20 12:11 PM] Slyris#2880
One oracle that fetch price from everywhere and store it on blockchain, that's it


[28-Aug-20 12:11 PM] Regnar#6164
Oh I was saying an exact push through. You have an endpoint with a list of coins, the server hits CP for all those coins and returns the results of only the coins you need.


[28-Aug-20 12:11 PM] Slyris#2880
And here in this case it's will be only one rpc call, to retrieve the oracle script result


[28-Aug-20 12:11 PM] Regnar#6164

[28-Aug-20 12:19 PM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
And that's where the main problem surfaces... Exchanges with fake volume that's not corrected by the 'Data Sources' will have a abnormal large influence on the price. An oracle only works when the data fed to it is certifiable correct.


[28-Aug-20 12:21 PM] Regnar#6164
Yep. And that's why "data sources" do things like deviations from means as a method of excluding prices from certain exchanges. Volume is a bit more difficult

There are parts we've not touched yet - like a swaps history / orders list. It needs pagination, trades P/L and prices counting, CSV export and etc. 
Also some solution is needed to see how many orders in particular pair orderbook before you select the pair, atm user need to brutforce to check if there is 0 orders or not

@allbits hmm, interesting - just re-tried on clean Ubuntu 20 and started fine for me :/

could you please try (in `AntaraAtomicDexAppDir` dir)?:

```
AntaraAtomicDexAppDir$ find . -name 'libQt5Quick.so.5'
./usr/lib/libQt5Quick.so.5

in general there is such lib in bundle

Just to clarify, if the icon of the app windows is not present, it's because this is possible only with appimage bundling for example with: https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher

The current bundle is just an archive with the binaries, it's not an appimage, doesn't bundle any icon (because it's need to follow icon linux desktop specifications)

[29-Aug-20 02:57 AM] jansako#3330
@Slyris What I am saying is to allow DeFi Pro to run in the background showing just as a system tray icon. I understand a full build is needed which 'hopefully' we will get with a full release... There already is an icon in the system tray which brings the app to the foreground.

Great release of the atomicDeFi Pro! But I have one suggestion: When you want to buy or sell a coin on the DEX tab, the button to place the order is labelled "start swap". This is misleading, because it doesn't start a swap until a taker accepts the order which can be never. Better label: "create order".

I would argue that showing the orderbook and your own open/active orders at the same time is more important (regardless of location). Could be done by highlighting your own orders in the orderbook though.Then there is no need to have a tab for it.

Uniswap vs. Sushiswap - the game of decentralised exchange thrones
Last week, a new to-be-launched decentralised exchange called SushiSwap started to make headlines in the cryptocurrency industry. The industry is plagued over the weekend hit-and-run projects, so having a clone project from anonymous authors making a long term impact is unusual.

Cant post the a video Coz using Discord from Web. Having issues with orderbook disappearing. Network issue?Any solution?


[31-Aug-20 04:17 AM] TonyL#3577
@Lord44 on what os are you? could you please describe a bit how dissapearing happening? (e.g. is it happening right after start or not, is selector changing helps, is it long session or not)


[31-Aug-20 04:22 AM] Lord44#5840
Windows 10 early version. Orderbook appears briefly when going into Dex tab but dissappars shortly after for any pairs. Every pair has the same issues . Firewall blocks? But in that case it should not entirely appear.Mostly happening right after start or swapping pairs but they disappear completely after that without appearing again.


[31-Aug-20 04:23 AM] TonyL#3577
Yeah, that sounds like a networking issue. Do you have VPN?


[31-Aug-20 04:26 AM] Lord44#5840
Nope, But i think there was some initial permission asked by Adefi to allow access from firewall which was most likely denied.But others functions are working well,Charts,graphs,Send, recieve, everything allright Exept Orderbook....

for coin paprika prices, are we using a single API to get ALL coins and then selecting the activated coins from the response? or are we making multiple single coin requests for just the coins that are activated?


[31-Aug-20 04:37 PM] Regnar#6164
Actually, looks like it's one per coin


[31-Aug-20 04:39 PM] Regnar#6164
Asking if CP will enable a batch API for coin data, IE. Request coin data with a single GET for specific coins.

OS @Jcharming ?


[31-Aug-20 10:56 PM] Jcharming#2693
Apologies, I know better. 
OS: Win10 64bit

I must admit i had the same behavior recently for some swaps


[31-Aug-20 11:00 PM] Jcharming#2693
It's a periodic spin up, it stays on for anywhere from 30s to 2m at a time.


[31-Aug-20 11:01 PM] Jcharming#2693
it's a swap that's been going on for 22m


[31-Aug-20 11:01 PM] Jcharming#2693
(just info)


[31-Aug-20 11:01 PM] Slyris#2880
But only during the end of a swap


[31-Aug-20 11:01 PM] Jcharming#2693
This started on `2/3 Swap Ongoing`  and has been intermittent throughout


[31-Aug-20 11:02 PM] Slyris#2880
Yes and if i remember this happens only on windows.

Which coins did you swap ?


[31-Aug-20 11:03 PM] Jcharming#2693

I can confirm that while GPU ranged from 68% - 84%  and that CPU was not affected.


[31-Aug-20 11:07 PM] Jcharming#2693
Actually I can't say that's true  CPU ranged from .5% to 3.2% I have an assumption that it only rose during GPU ramps. But have not been monitoring it like I have been the GPU.

[02-Sep-20 10:16 AM] Jcharming#2693
@Lord44 I just don't use Linux as my everyday operating system, I'm definitely in that sense much more of a 'consumer' or 'typical' user in my day to day life.  
I'd thought about trying to set up a dual boot situation just for product testing for some things, but it turns out that years ago when I did that I didn't use it as much as I thought I would.


[02-Sep-20 10:16 AM] Jcharming#2693
So now I just give feedback from winOS


[02-Sep-20 10:21 AM] Lord44#5840
@Jcharming  Fine, I would not persue you to use linux or Dual boot. You are probably deep into widows ecosysem and dont want to move... But over the years Linux has improved tremendously, A well customized linux OS will put Widows to shame any days. Windows gaming power edge is also closing up day by day.

[02-Sep-20 10:26 AM] Jcharming#2693
That's cool, how about I do a take-away from this conversation as Linux has advanced since years ago when I last used it, and when I feel I have an opportunity in the coming months consider re-adding a dual boot situation again.  As the honest truth is I'd love to be in a different environment bc I feel windows is very invasive and not very ...inefficient? if that's the right word.  I'm aware of these short comings, and I can't have a disruption in my day to day use with how I work.  So if someone sends me an application and there is no linux support or I have to learn how to do something in linux then it's just too much for me atm.
*edit efficient to inefficient lol woops*


[02-Sep-20 10:27 AM] Jcharming#2693
Atm I think I also just like sharing from the end user perspective that I spend a lot of time in which is representative of a lot of the everyday population I am involved with for my work.  Who all use windows. :/


[02-Sep-20 10:31 AM] Lord44#5840
thats means"Most of the peoples are so deep into widows ecosystem that moving will  disrupt their workflow..Same reason Linux did not take over.


[02-Sep-20 10:41 AM] Jcharming#2693
Yea I can agree that most people who I know that use windows and are aware of Linux feel there will be a disruption to their workflow while making a switch to Linux, and there is some concern about being able to seek and implement answers if they want to run something that isn't 'plug and play' linux compatible sadly.


[02-Sep-20 10:42 AM] Jcharming#2693
I've come to see it as one of the necessary evils I guess.   It's good that there is one main OS a lot of people are using, it's bad that it is WIndows.  haha

I don't know if this should be in marketing but is the Adex pro something that is being marketed to at least incentivize  people to test or get liquidity?


[04-Sep-20 03:15 AM] jansako#3330
Still in Alpha so only word of mouth AFAIK. I understand there will be a larger push once Beta.

Even still, need people using it to report bugs to provide feedback

If no one is using it, by the time it goes to beta, then we find out problems

Maybe we can take a page out of crypto.com, we list KMD - other coin at 50%. Can we lock a trade of a pubkey to a certain size?

So we have say 1000 trades of x size  for 1000 pubkeys

@Deleted User people are using it, bugs are being reported. I don't think bringing on types of people who don't treat it as an Alpha product is best right now. We don't want to bring on regular traders or non tech people who have no intention with following through the steps to report bugs or swap issues for us to fix, and instead give it bad reviews because they don't get it is alpha. For now I think it's best to keep it in hands of those looking to mess with alpha products and follow up with reports and pull requests.

Hi*


[05-Sep-20 08:30 AM] dth88#2674
@GuilouGuilouOTE hello, yes this whole thread is dedicated to atomicdex-pro, if you have any questions this is the place to ask for support.


[05-Sep-20 11:00 AM] GuilouGuilouOTE#1930
I have noted severals issues while using the last version of atomicDEXPro:

1. Even if il click on the french flag to switch the app in french, nothing happen. Same when I click on the turkish flag

2. It seem to be an error at login. 
When asked about my account's passphrase, the letters "√©, √®, √ß, √†" cannot be typed.
I'm therefore unable to write my full password and have acces to my funds.
It's also impossible to paste my full password although when I right click there is a "paste" button (but nothing happens)
PS: I have loged succesfully 6 or 7 times before the issue arise


3. Is there anyone I can DM about failed swap? Since the first version of atomicDEXPro I have never been able to complete 1 swap (I gave the app the access trought the windows firewall and I use a portable version) 
I already prepared logs and screen-captures to send to quickly explain the issue


[05-Sep-20 11:12 AM] Slyris#2880
Hello @GuilouGuilouOTE are you french ?


[05-Sep-20 11:12 AM] Slyris#2880
You can directly DM me, i will check with you


[05-Sep-20 11:13 AM] Slyris#2880
@naezith-work can you confirm about the policy password if we allow accent or not ?


[05-Sep-20 11:15 AM] jansako#3330
About the copy/paste issue, could it be that you are trying to paste from Excel? There is an issue where if you select a cell with the password, you cannot copy/paste into the login screen. If you, however go into the cell in Excel, and select the text itself, you can copy/paste it that way (by doing 'CTRL + V' to paste).


[05-Sep-20 11:16 AM] Slyris#2880
If the password doesn't respect the password policy he will not be able to paste it.


[05-Sep-20 11:16 AM] jansako#3330
Understood. Doing a 'good' password the 'wrong' way won't work either. Considering he said it worked before.


[05-Sep-20 11:19 AM] naezith-work#3299
currently password input accepts only ascii characters


[05-Sep-20 11:19 AM] Slyris#2880
And i think you can see it during the account creation the policy is explictly showed


[05-Sep-20 11:20 AM] Slyris#2880
I confirm that here at the account creation we cannot specify characters like `√©`

[05-Sep-20 11:21 AM] Slyris#2880
And the policy is the same on the login page, that's why you are not able to paste your password.

note that translations are not complete yet


[05-Sep-20 12:10 PM] GuilouGuilouOTE#1930
ok so about the password issue I made a mistake, indeed my password don't include the character "√©" (but I thought it did because when I chose it, I think nothing prevented me of and the character just did not appeared, maybe it is a thing to adress ?)
So all good regarding the password thing

For the language problem I confirm that clicking on differents flags do nothing. (WIN 7 SP1)

For my swap issue, I will dm you @Slyris  some logs and additionnal informations

Thank you all, cheers'

seeing some failed BTC/KMD swaps because `"taker_swap:693] Started_at time_dif over 60 172"`
someone tried couple of times... but need to first fix his system clock, else no swap will work, clock is 3 mins off


[05-Sep-20 12:30 PM] Slyris#2880
@cipi He have the same error right now


[05-Sep-20 12:30 PM] Slyris#2880
but i'm able to do swap


[05-Sep-20 12:30 PM] Slyris#2880
he get the same for RICK/MORTY


[05-Sep-20 12:31 PM] cipi#4502
system clock must be in sync with real time... if it differs more than 60s, swaps fail


[05-Sep-20 12:31 PM] Slyris#2880
cc @GuilouGuilouOTE


[05-Sep-20 12:32 PM] Slyris#2880
But @cipi Just trying to understand.

Is it something like `now() - timestamp_start` ?


[05-Sep-20 12:32 PM] Slyris#2880
which is already > 60s ?


[05-Sep-20 12:33 PM] cipi#4502
i think it is the system clock that is off


[05-Sep-20 12:33 PM] Slyris#2880
Yeah but in this case how it's determined `timestamp_start` from the swap ?


[05-Sep-20 12:34 PM] cipi#4502
```
        let time_dif = (self.r().data.started_at as i64 - maker_data.started_at as i64).abs();
        if time_dif > 60 {
            return Ok((Some(TakerSwapCommand::Finish), vec![TakerSwapEvent::NegotiateFailed(
                ERRL!("Started_at time_dif over 60 {}", time_dif).into(),
```
found this in API code


[05-Sep-20 12:34 PM] Slyris#2880
Because let's say you determine all the timestamp with the system clock even if you have a delay the delay will be also on the timestamp start


[05-Sep-20 12:34 PM] Slyris#2880
If it's determined without system clock, then yes the delay will be a problem


[05-Sep-20 12:34 PM] cipi#4502
it compares the time `started_at` from maker and taker and if it differs more than 60s the swap fails


[05-Sep-20 12:35 PM] Slyris#2880
Not sure how it's work in rust, but in C++ we have a difference between a `system_clock` and a `high_resolution_clock`


[05-Sep-20 12:35 PM] cipi#4502
i don't know rust, just looking in the code üôÇ

It's was the problem, we solved it now


[05-Sep-20 12:37 PM] Slyris#2880
I wonder if it's possible to detect this delay programatically so we can have a warning message at the start of adex pro if the system clock is unsynchronized


[05-Sep-20 12:39 PM] cipi#4502
i opened an issue some time ago in mobile github: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX/issues/133
you would need to fetch the time from a time server and compare with system clock... if it differs, raise a warning

[05-Sep-20 12:40 PM] Slyris#2880
Currently in adex pro we assume that the lang that you use will be your timezone


[05-Sep-20 12:40 PM] Slyris#2880
Which is not always true.


[05-Sep-20 12:41 PM] Slyris#2880
In fact we use a library that is able to detect your timezone in C++

```cpp

    using namespace date;

    const sys_time<TimeFormat> tp{TimeFormat{timestamp}};

[05-Sep-20 12:46 PM] Slyris#2880
i can also detect this error on the swap details and add a little hint in the swap details panel


[05-Sep-20 12:47 PM] Slyris#2880
such has `Hint: is your system clock synced with your timezone`

As promised, a little surprise concerning the progress of the week: Redesign of the wallet page to switch to an asynchronous model. Asynchronous rewards claiming and unlimited transaction history with scrolling that fetch as you go.

The send button also becomes asynchronous, next step are notifications when your balance changes (incoming / outgoing coins).

Trying to send from Verus Desktop to AtomicDexPro and I get kpX.umod is not an instruction, is there something wrong with address that ADP is giving me or is this an issue with Verus Desktop? Any help would be appreciated.


[09-Sep-20 08:10 AM] gcharang#6833
@FBTroy it is an issue with the latest verus desktop. I heard using a previous release will work for now. https://github.com/VerusCoin/Verus-Desktop/releases/tag/v0.7.1-4


[09-Sep-20 08:20 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
That is correct. The windows version (only that one) shows this behavior at the moment


[09-Sep-20 01:16 PM] FBTroy#9693
Thanks all, that did the trick. I have successfully swapped on ADP. Feels good and I like not having my phone tied up.


[09-Sep-20 03:38 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Verus Desktop have a bug in its 0.7.15 release, I just installed it and got an error flag like @FBTroy without even sending a tx?

@cipi Hi cipi are you able to add VCOIN to the wallet/Dex if it is compatible?


[14-Sep-20 03:04 AM] t_dan#3334
> I wonder if that new wall @20 KMD is them.
@jansako That 2524 DEX order @20 KMD is actually a sell order, not a buy order. So that's not a "loading up", but an "unloading" of DEX.


[14-Sep-20 03:14 AM] jansako#3330
Someone first bought up a few k of DEX all the way to 18. Then a new wall appeared @20. I was asking if that is the same someone. My comments were a while apart but Discord does not show that üôÇ @t_dan


[14-Sep-20 05:46 AM] cipi#4502
those are the same DEX that were offered for a lower price before... taker buys into the wall -> wall moves up in price üòâ

@coolermaster this one https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/vcoin-vcc/ ? i am able to test a swap on atomicDEX-API, but integration into GUIs also requires electrumx support https://github.com/spesmilo/electrumx and some electrum servers


[14-Sep-20 05:58 AM] coolermaster#4963
Yes that's the one @cipi .... Does it not support electrum? I wouldn't know.....


[14-Sep-20 06:00 AM] coolermaster#4963
I get lost in sea of computer babble here lol


[14-Sep-20 06:01 AM] cipi#4502
VCC is not in the file https://github.com/spesmilo/electrumx/blob/master/electrumx/lib/coins.py ... likely easy to add (looks like a Zcash fork), but someone has to do it and run the electrums
are you involved with VCC?


[14-Sep-20 06:03 AM] coolermaster#4963
I'm in contact on their discord....


[14-Sep-20 06:04 AM] cipi#4502
i am asking because a paid listing would provide them with all that is needed, including the electrums


[14-Sep-20 06:05 AM] coolermaster#4963
Yes they said about a cost I think it's getting discussed by the team


[14-Sep-20 06:06 AM] coolermaster#4963
So it would be possible to have on  wallet/Dex with the paid listing?


[14-Sep-20 06:06 AM] cipi#4502
pretty sure, yes... best is to talk to @ca333 about the details


[14-Sep-20 06:08 AM] coolermaster#4963
I will have to wait their decision and then best if they contact you guys direct.
Thanks for the information üëç

@‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª they'll remain as long as you have the kmd in the wallet, but they'll never match as those KMD are locked for another swap

The UI implementation could get a bit tricky, as it has no effect on Taker orders & I am a fan of not showing stuff to the user that has no effect :-). There may be other features like this, but it may be time for having an 'advanced' section of the order creation UI that only shows on demand, then having a checkbox there with a field to enter desire min order size...

I'd like to request a built in faucet feature. It would work such that any supported coin would have a facuet address to donate to. Then when you are running AtomicDex and have an open order, it triggers the faucet automatically for you and your address gets the small amount. 1. This would encourage AtomicDex users to be more active. And 2. This would help coin communities advertise.

@Fii there were some clang 8/9 transition issues with ubuntu 16.04, do not remember for sure what was the case exactly, though maybe @Slyris or @TonyL  can back me up here, and at some point we decided to drop it from regular QA routine. please use 18.04 or 20.04 for tested experience üôÇ

Now the app loads, but when i add coins, sometimes it does not seem to add it to the GUI.


[21-Sep-20 09:06 PM] Fii2#0670
So i shutdown the app, open it again, terminal goes crazy trying to activate the coins i had before i closed it, on the GUI i only see BTC/KMD instead of the 10 i had, then it crashed.

@Fii Thank you for the report! can you DM me the log file with this issue please? (also you can create an issue on github yourself if you wish so, there's a bug-report template), there's no data folders for coins hence no need to delete data folder to start over. So you just logged in and then activated the coins? any other steps? want to try to reproduce on 18.04

Verus does not control the exchanges, so if an exchange implements additional requirements after the listing date, there's not much we can do except delist, which is madness if you look at the amount of listings.

Just some feedback here. When I went to use AtomicDex Pro yesterday, the onboarding was great. First issue I had was that it only shows KMD and BTC as the only options at first (unlike mobile version). I had to look around different buttons to search for a place to add other coins (since our p2p trade was in Verus).  It would reduce friction to have more base pairs showing.


[25-Sep-20 09:23 AM] CyberTrucker#5260
I also think the order book should show trailing zeros. It makes it pretty confusing to understand what is going on.


[25-Sep-20 09:25 AM] CyberTrucker#5260
For example, the current VRSC vs BTC order book, it looks like the bid side is higher priced than the ask side, and forces you to count leading zeroes.

@BoBot-LunaMaxi It's not that easy, but few solutions are emerging to allow swap `XMR <-> BTC`, for example the work from @Kayaba https://medium.com/@MerosCrypto/implementing-monero-atomic-swaps-in-asmr-715e4bdb752

Some challenge, but if we are able to swap `XMR <-> BTC` it's potentially possible to swap `XMR <-> KMD` with `XMR <-> BTC` and then `BTC <-> KMD`, need liquidity too

I'm confirming now you can recover a single key and use it for both the inputs and the outputs. Sapling uses two distinct spend keys for those, but I'm pretty sure thats just to prevent linkability.


[27-Sep-20 11:46 PM] Kayaba#5184
And then that leaves actually constructing the ZK proofs, which will be annoying. This isn't at all compatible with ZIP32 so you can't outsource to the daemon :/


[27-Sep-20 11:47 PM] Kayaba#5184
Unless it exposes some really low level cryptography over the RPC (manual specification of every derived key used to spend funds sent to a shielded address)

You'd probably need to rip out the ZK code, unfortunately

to expensive scale indicator on the bottom goes from expedient to expensive. I really like that. poetic.


[28-Sep-20 10:56 PM] Slyris#2880
@Komodefi Hey !

Thanks to share your experience, it's was on Mobile or Desktop ? Which version are you using ? 

When you was about to starting your swaps, which configuration did you choose ? `DPow` security or specify number of `confirmations` ?

The application is only in `alpha-testing` phase, I really advise to use it carefully - Regarding the trading part all the informations about the price and the danger of a trade are displayed.


>  I got mixed up on the order books and gui nomenclature. 
Sad to ear that, can you give more details about your experience, if you have any suggestions for improvements feel free to give your opinion.

> took about 40min each. 
Yes we are aware of that, we also want to reach instant swaps in the future, however few solutions exist in the app to help reducing drastically the time of a swap with `DPow / Rels` confs, before validating a trade you can specify with a checkbox if you want to override the default confirmations settings, for example a swap with a single confirmation will take drastically less time than a swap that need to be `DPow` confirmed.

@naezith-work I think it's will be a good idea to add in the FAQ a question for reducing the time of a swap with a gif example specifying number of confirmations.


[01-Oct-20 10:35 AM] Komodefi#5638
Desktop, latest .dmg from github, I didn't have dpow enabled. The wait time was not an issue for me.  the fees I saved from not having to go through kyc exchanges make it worth the wait imo. Great job and it really looks awesome.

@tolken
[Moving my comments to this channel from the mobile beta channel] I'm going to open a feature request on github for that idea, let's expand on it a bit more so I can make the request more meaningful. What were you thinking for top markets? 

Maybe a "Homepage" when you click on DEX tab, instead of jumping directly to a trading pair and having to figure out which one you're on.
On this page it could have top markets, trending, new additions, kind of like this

[02-Oct-20 05:41 AM] Regnar#6164
On this "DEX home page" it might be good to have a small section to "request a coin listing" near the bottom. I know that it won't be as simple as adding the ERC20 coins because of these rules <https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins#0-the-coin-must-have-participated-in-a-successful-atomic-swap-using-atomicdex-api>
but it could give us a good idea what types of coins people are looking to add (i.e. Demand signal). This would also set a future ability for the team to monetize listings to pay for continued development.

In addition to the categories in the image above, it might also be a cool idea to incorporate transaction fee changes in this, at least those of the main pairs where the fees change drastically. for example showing "ETH tx fees +18% today" or "BTC tx fees +5%" or w.e. This would give traders a headsup before trying to swap these more expensive tx fee coins.

Another additional field could be expected tx times for these coins based on the lowest possible tx fee. "ETH swap times +30 mins today" "BTC swap times +60 mins today" etc.
Coin of the day field could be promoted coins, another future revenue for the team.

Okay so that metric RPC is only for Prometheus integration. I read those docs as that RPC was for metrics, but it could also go to Prometheus, not that it was only for Prometheus


[02-Oct-20 09:13 AM] gcharang#6833
yes, those metrics work with prometheus the best. but, they are also useful on their own without dealing with prometheus at all. they are all different ways of measuring and reporting events

These countries have strict regulatory laws and we decided together with legal counsel to comply with those @lightspeed393 in order to enable mainstream usage when we roll out stable RC.

Maybe you are not aware but protocols such as uniswap and CO. are one step away from classification of terrorist and money laundering organisation - no institution, no corp, basically not one dollar from corporate world can be used in this protocols - its clearly matter of time for their operators facing criminal offences ref. money laundering, terrorism financing and so on.

The difficulty is not in the DEX itself - i.e. if this was only about providing a piece of software our problems would be smaller. But as we provide this as a service  and real enduser applications (released through official corp) with operating underlying infrastructure and so on our responsibility/liability is bigger. Its sad reality. 

But I am certain one day 'someone' will fork the codebase and provide a non-compliance/anarcho version üôÇ ..

[06-Oct-20 08:31 AM] Regnar#6164
Sounds like your legal team gave you advice in order to ensure they have job security constantly evaluating compliance throughout the world.


[06-Oct-20 08:33 AM] Regnar#6164
Buying and selling cryptocurrencies in the US is Legal. It is up to the individual to report on gains and losses as well as investments. That's why US citizens file taxes each year, and why those tax forms specifically ask about trading information. Banning US IP addresses from trading is denying them the chance to even be compliant.

Pretty sure we already have individual "Black lists" to avoid trades with makers and takers who drop out of trades too often. If you wanted to implement a universal "compliant" DEX. you would enable country IPs within the user settings of the DEX and allow users to determine which countries they are willing to trade with. For example US citizens are legally allowed to trade with most other countries, buy things online, make peer to peer trades via craigslist etc. but are legally required to report those trades to IRS. 

So, say they aren't allowed to trade with Iran, allowing them to select their "country of origin" on start up, explaining that selecting a particular country will limit IP addresses they can trade with, ie. prefiltering their blacklist to block Iran IP addresses makes more sense.

But then again, this is precedent. By treating this as a service instead of open source software, you are putting yourself into the position to always and forever provide future AML and KYC information. In that case, this "IP blocking" isn't going to be enough anyway. 

Bitmex blocked US IP addresses (just like you are doing), but the CFTC wanted more. Then what happens when users flout your IP address filtering with a VPN? KYC and AML info which you will also have to then collect. Then you will have to securely store this information in compliance with each countries methods of storing KYC/AML data, in that compliant country, without it routing outside that country for any reason, even in transit. Then you'll have to limit who can actually see the data, perhaps have to hire staff in each country that requires a citizen to handle private citizen data.

Then you will have to build separate orderbooks for different countries to trade with one another, no US traders trading with Syrians or maybe next week it will be Turkey, or China. Then how do you ensure those traders are from Turkey or China and not just using a VPN? So you'll have to expand your KYC and AML out on a global scale, collecting from people in countries that don't require it, to placate whichever country is most strict. 

Then what happens when China requires you to turn over KYC and AML data you collected on Americans because they want to ensure their citizens are compliant? Or vice versa? 

This is all besides the point of what the orderbooks will actually look like...

@Slyris well you just made my point for me. If you and the team continue on ip-block verison, then the community maintaining a non ip-block version would be a bit difficult. The main takeaway being the team would not be maintaining 2 versions of the same software to cater to ip and non ip.

Then you need to announce that this product is NOT by Komodo, but by this 3rd party entity. There are investors who need to be aware of this, and not informing them that a private entity is enforcing particular laws based on the entities jurisdiction, on an open source project will be perceived as a either the company is hijacking Komodo or that Komodo was always this entity and the entire ICO fund is an unregistered security.

Do you guys seriously not understand this?

@WnyCrypto 
I think it's great how passionate you are, and that you're such a strong activist.  The path through crypto, regulation, and eventual freedom is going to be a bit more circuitous than any of us expect it to be I'd imagine as it's going against an industry that has all the money in the world right now.... well most of it now at this point.

`You NEED to separate the entity from Komodo. I cant stress this enough` @Regnar this is not as easy as you may think. If we  separate the entity from Komodo not much would be left of Komodo. 

Legal compliance is mandatory - specifically when you release financial trading software in form of end-user applications and network infrastructure. Who do you think is publishing the dapps through official play and app store accounts and who do you think operates the network? Furthermore AtomicDEX is technically operating on a Security Token (DEX) and this is not a secret anymore - let alone the legal implications - things that taken care of now, better belated than never. There are not many legal options to fix this unfortunate legacy setup it was built on - and we do only have the choice between complying or running an illicit operation. Maybe someone forks the DEX software and operates a non-regulated fork? But this will definitely not be us.


[06-Oct-20 09:45 AM] dukeleto#7326
jl777 is not in charge of KMD anymore, so why do the real cypherpunks follow KMD anymore ? Who are the real SUPERnet hackers?

[06-Oct-20 09:46 AM] Regnar#6164
@actionslacks then you should pay close attention to what I just said. This action and the entity you are using to protect yourselves needs to be separated from Komodo as the decentralized group.

Because either A, it is perceived that this entity is hijacking Komodo and KMD prices plummet, which could be legal reason to bring case against the entity for a form of manipulation.

Or B. Komodo and the entity were always the same and the million dollars raised in the ICO will be an unregistered security and you guys will end up in prison.

@dukeleto 

I think it's more complicated than that, and it's an evolving landscape.  I can say with certainty that those involved in Komodo still hold the same values. This isn't a final move and there are still many options to explore.

@dukeleto It's obvious this is something you're very concerned about, if it makes you feel more comfortable not submitting code anymore until more of the facts come in I'd understand that for sure.  I'd encourage you to watch Q4 as more information comes in as opposed to jumping to abandon a the project here you're passionate about.

@ca333 i think the bigger question is what I asked about before with API/mm2. Will ip-block be implemented there as well? 

If it's in atomicDEX-Pro, so be it. I get it especially if you'll be releasing services on top of it. And others can make a new gui like @hyperDEX. But if it's in the core as well, then that's clearly more of an issue.

@ca333 not as easy as I may think? You made an entity to collect revenues, protect your devs, operate a regulated DEX. Got it. But it cannot be one in the same with Komodo, even if all the DEVs are the same. 

If it is, Komodo ICO was an unregistered security, even in 2016/2017 lax laws.

[06-Oct-20 09:56 AM] ca333#0333
our personal standpoint has no place in this and is irrelevant as we have investors and DEX/revsassets backers to protect. And if we kept things as is it would mean we put our personal interests (to not comply and to not follow their rules, et cetera) above the interests of the DEX asset holders and people who expect this to become a profitable and LEGAL venture one day.

No one here likes this geolocation blocking ‚Äì but we have to be a bit understanding and view the big picture.

I will support whatever decision the dev team makes as they are the ones taking all the heat for developing and maintaining the code and infrastructure. It's not right for anyone not directly involved demand them to keep going on a path that involves risks of prisonment and so on.

The code is open source, anyone can take what we have develop and continue to develop and spin up a fully unregulated software.

Komodo keeps pushing decentralized open source technology forward, and eventually that might lead to more robust networks that don't require any infrastructure that can be shutdown. Once the technology matures it cannot be stopped as it no longer relies on a small team of contributors.

We have to stand behind the developers who are trying to develop something that goes against the world wide special interests. Who can demand them to continue on the path that could land them a life time prison sentence? If you think you can do it, then take the code and keep on pushing. It's everyones personal choice. 

Stop the blame guys and let's cool down.

@dukeleto This is all much more complicated from a team and project perspective.  
If you go full cyber anarch and then release + support a fork of the dex it's possible you will run into the same compliance issues at some point.  
This doesn't mean that you can't, but it does mean that you may eventually have to face decisions about risk from regulatory bodies. When that happens you'll have to make decisions about what to do and how you can further your ideals and values, which these bodies can make it very difficult for you to do.

This is a good point @Cryptoon on many levels.  And there is nothing to say that the AtomicDEX is the only thing in the works for an p2p trading solution.  If it's obvious that there is regulatory issue here then instead of fighting it one immediatly, one method is to work with it and then begin refining the original product making something new in a new direction so that we can have a more self sovereign solution to then avoid these 'imperial entanglements'  AtomicDEX may HAVE to deal with this issue now, while more solutions are implemented to make sure it doesn't have to deal with this ever again.

Duke is picking up speed again. The same game as back then with Pirate. I can even understand you, but you're too emotional right now. You have a vision, fork the DEX and do your thing. Your responsibility or the responsibility of your community. 
I can understand both sides and I'm shocked right now, honestly.

@suhthern-girl 

It's very clear that no one likes this or the idea of this so you're not alone, and there is a lot of information still coming out about this.  
With that being said it isn't completely clear yet what can and can't be done regarding this issue long term, but the team is dedicated to finding solutions.  Those solutions will have to start taking into account other players which may have ignored Komodo before.

Part of the problem is The Fraud of the U.S. Corporation.  They want you to believe that they are totally in charge of the several States and the people, and to a large extent they have done this.  No one internationally challenges their claims to jurisdiction -- They do not have complete jurisdiction in the several States of America.


[06-Oct-20 10:21 AM] suhthern-girl#8418
The biggest warning I can give is to NOT SIGN ANY CONTRACTS with the U.S. or an entity that gives the U.S. jurisdiction.  It is all fraud and will entangle you regardless.

@Seko 

Is your concern that  @dukeleto is going to do something to hurt the project?  
My take away here is that he wants to pursue ignore proactive engagement with compliance and regulatory agencies and do forked work.  In my head I can only see how this benefits the project as a whole. 
I can connect with the 'making it public' but there's not a lot to share right now, and we're not even sure what 0.3.0 is going to look like regarding this issue.  Which the 0.3.0 is our first release for Q4 on the roadmap.  This really just means there's not much to be made 'public' atm too.

@Jcharming I will say that a number of people are saying that President Trump is in the process of creating the new QFS (financial system) and that he plans to take down the U.S. Corporation and restore the Republic.  I hear that there will be a version of this for each country, so that in the U.K., for instance, there will be a return to Common (and Constitutional) Law.

@ejuliano 
SOLID QUESTION HERE : )

How: A general announcement in the #üì¢‚îÉannouncements  is where to look for it and how you'll be able to find out more about this subject. 

When:  That's a bit more complicated, I'd say as soon as we know more as a team and follow the evidence to find the best solution.  For example though if it comes out implimented with the 0.3.0 beta release (the next release on the roadmap for Q4 <https://komodoplatform.com/komodo-q4-2020-roadmap-whats-to-come/>) 
Then it will be in the marketing leading up to that so 2-3 weeks prior to the 0.3.0 release this quarter.


[06-Oct-20 10:47 AM] Jcharming#2693
There may be nothing to release on the topic though ^ as it may turn out to be a non-issue.


[06-Oct-20 10:48 AM] ejuliano#8606
oh...in what way would it be a non-issue? @Jcharming


[06-Oct-20 10:49 AM] suhthern-girl#8418
I cannot say with certainty, but I believe that there will be a period of a few days(?) of 'darkness' during which time there will be a news/internet(?) blackout, at least in North America, when President Trump will be able to speak to directly to the people without the MSM's getting in the way.


[06-Oct-20 10:50 AM] Jcharming#2693
It's still very unclear what constitutes a threat for us from bodies like the SEC in this issue.  
One of the possible outcomes is that we discover that AtomicDEX exists in a grey area and we do not need to enact any changes.

@Slyris 

Pass this around everyone here -   
It's very unclear what this might look like, it's just something that's being explored and prepped for as an option if we need it due to regulatory uncertainty as we move forward.


[06-Oct-20 10:59 AM] Slyris#2880
I'm glad lot of people here follow the dev branch and new feature. But waiting for official announcement before making any assumption is always something smart.

Code is open-source, discussion are welcomed, always glad to answer everyone.

Issues are still the best way to speak about problems regarding the application, mostly because people will think before writing anything. Emotion doesn't help here.


[06-Oct-20 11:00 AM] Jcharming#2693

@Slyris I get what you're saying but unmerged code still falls into development discussion. If I were to have asked my question on a github issue, you or @TonyL would have responded to me there and there would have been no community discussion. Just the few people who happen to see the issue, which would most likely be the same people noticing the commits. I wasn't intending to cause outrage, just get some sort of team input on the plan/details.


[06-Oct-20 11:07 AM] Slyris#2880
@Deleted User This is not a solution first of all, because you put yourself in danger if you do that, as the same if you clone the code and remove the check for ip_filtering yourself, you also put yourself in danger in this case.

That's said, CA was very clear on this topic, this is temporary until we are compliant, us citizens will be able to use the application.

Yeah @lightspeed393 I appreciate your involvement, don't worry.

It's just that we speak about a specific restriction that i didn't finish to code yet.

> @Deleted User 
> 
I can actually comment and answer on this some.  A lot of this is concerning what we (Komodo) help faciliate, which then tags us as a money laundery threat for AML/KYC compliance laws.  

Ideas like 'a built in VPN' are on the list of what's being explored. 
If we had to comply it's a good place to look for a way to make things work, 
however if it's seen as enabling money laundering and helping avoid compliance, then it may not be a solution.  
These are the things we're having conversations with compliance lawyers regarding. 

Keep the ideas coming though!  The community is part of the team, this is something @ca333 said to me as I onboarded at the end of last quarter, and the ideas here give us more avenues to pursue.

@ejuliano 

If there is geo-blocking It would mostly just constitute that Komodo as an group is showing an attempt to cooperate with Anti Money Laundering Laws.   

what the end user decides to do with it with a VPN is entirely different thing and not something Komodo would have to be concerned about.

@hastrup 

This is a great statement you made earlier which I think touches at the heart of the matter of what's going on.    

There are huge amount of laws and regulatory bodies especially in the financial sector.  Some of these do not apply to us and some do.  And some can be navigated in such a way that they can be ignored.  

This is what we're trying to figure out right now.  Being proactive to make sure that there is no undo problems while figuring it out is smart.

[06-Oct-20 12:05 PM] Jcharming#2693
I can answer this one.  @hastrup 

Bitorrent (and torrent applications) do not work with asset (money) transfer, however in the early years of torrent applications there was a huge amount of regulatory pressure put on hosting sites regarding both torrents and anyone willing to allow downloads of torrenting applications. Over time this became an ISP issue, who then passed this on through a regulatory framework to the customer.  
This evolved in this way, mostly, because it became to difficult to enforce on a provider side.  That discovery took a lot of time to get to though.

With direct asset exchange (like currency) the smallest bottleneck is the provider.  Traditionally this is the target for legal precedence in the financial space.  To things like the SEC, Komodo as a team may be an exchange operator, and may be supporting unregulated money laundering options.  That makes the devs, the bankers in this sense. 
This is the main difference here.  Over time it may be discovered that the end user is the better thing to police, like how ISP's do it with torrenting, but for now the legal framework is through targeting the producers and maintainers.

@hastrup 
it is! and IF you're on the SEC radar, and IF you do less than 10,000$ annually you'll likely be ignored. 
However if they can't find you, they can't enforce you. 

This is a key difference between laws and their ability to be enforced.  Laws are not ethics, and they are not written necessarily solely with ethics in mind.

At any point we are all committing in fractures to our legal system (where we live or interact with online) at a rate of equal to or higher than 1/day almost assuredly.  The key is to stay out of executable recourse from those that are looking to enforce the law, when doing so. 

Sometimes we're out of the way of danger bc no one is looking to execute the judicial process on that person that day.  
Sometimes it looks like staying out of the limelight, like using a VPN to access something.  
Sometimes this looks like breaking the law, and paying the fee associated with it. 
Sometimes this look like compliance on the front end...

I'm just giving some examples.

@Audo not necessarily this moment, but at some point could you elaborate more on where the actual liablity lies for the team. Like cipi mentioned before, code is freedom of speech, so the software itself isn't the issue. So does the liablity lie more with team members running marketmaker nodes, or the structure of the protocol itself because fees are sent to an address controlled by the team, which pays a % to holders of the asset, etc. I'm sure both could be an issue, but it would be interesting to know and make things easier for people to understand.

@mb 

It's a possibility, but there is no annoucement on it yet.  Komodo is exploring regulatory issues that we all are going to be facing soon.


[06-Oct-20 12:36 PM] Regnar#6164
I feel like I'm repeating myself...

Atomicdex GUI implements Geo IP blocking because the legal entity (not sure who owns it or where it's jurisdiction is) needs it to operate in compliance. Got it, that's a business.

Komodo is a decentralized organization is not the same as this entity, even if many of the developers work for the entity.

Conflating the two is dangerous for both the developers working for the entity, the KMD holders, and 3rd party developers working on Komodo stuff. 

It's dangerous because some regulator will sweep through and say "Komodo raised $1M in an ICO, Komodo is this legal entity, all developers working on their stuff are involved. Because it's a legal entity, the ICO is an unregistered security offering, everyone who owns KMD illegally bought a security of this company. All exchanges must delist this unregulated security"

By conflating the two you will scuttle Komodo. AtomicDEX should remain the domain of the open source, decentralized project Komodo. You should cease using Komodo to describe the legal entity. 

The legal entity should then do exactly what Komodo has been encouraging other 3rd parties to do, download the software and build the business on it, including adding their own KYC, AML, or w.e. other regulatory changes they need.

Stop using the Komodo name to describe the actions of your legal entity.

It's a good question and the truth, and unsatisfactory, answer is:  It really depends on the regulatory body and what it's capabilities are for coming after you.

AtomicDEX *is* one the resulting products created by members of the Komodo Team. This effectively ties KMD, Komodo, and AtomicDEX together from a place of legal authority in different ways. 
It may not be possible to disambiguate these things from point of regulatory boundaries. 
And the opposite may also be true that they can be separated on paper, in some ways that is yet to be clarified.


[06-Oct-20 12:49 PM] Regnar#6164
This whole thing is ridiculous. Komodo has been telling 3rd parties for years that they provide solutions for them to build their businesses with, that Atomicdex is a core they can build their own GUI, enforce their own regulations etc. 

That is what this should be. The devs and other people pushing this should just standup their 3rd party, use the code for their purposes, just like everyone else.

Conflating the business with the core will just bring down a storm of regulatory issues on everything and anything Komodo, instead of the entity it should be aimed at.

Komodo *may* have a larger responsibility here in a regulatory capacity for what is being built.  
It *may* not.  
It's just one of the many possible outcomes that needs to be explored.

It's not entirely clear from a regulatory POV if it's just going to be the GUI that would come under scrutiney or the underlying engine.  Either way, as the crypto landscape matures all projects are having to adapt and find news paths to pursue their values.


> That is what this should be. The devs and other people pushing this should just standup their 3rd party, use the code for their purposes, just like everyone else.

I think anyone can build on the underlying engine and develop a GUI on it just fine, that doesn't mean Komodo won't go under scrutiny for developing the underlying tech if it's specifically for the finance sector.  It's a possibility an organization like the SEC may not disambiguate the diffeerence here.  
Or everything may be just fine.  




> Conflating the business with the core will just bring down a storm of regulatory issues on everything and anything Komodo, instead of the entity it should be aimed at.

@Regnar 

Well, you are a part of the Komodo team as part of the social structure here.  You provide feedback and help influence the direction of the decentralized project that the Komodo Team pursues.  

You may not a part of the legal entity that is Komodo though,  however the dev's might be both. 

> This entity comprised of tons of the devs  looking for legal protection and pushing IP banning should do the right and smart thing, stand up an entity and publicly separate it from Komodo core.
@Regnar 
This is where it gets really really tricky.  Even if the dev team that is working up the AtomicDEX release seperates from Komodo to release it, one of the questions asked by a regulatory agency will be 'where did you get the funds to do this'   
If Komodo helped fund this project than Komodo may hold responsibility.


[06-Oct-20 01:15 PM] Jcharming#2693

@WnyCrypto 

I'm part of the community too.  And what's going on is just an exploration of options, Komodo can't exist or continue to work on anything if tomorrow it gets crushed by a regulatory body.  I don't think devs or anyone are thinking about throwing away the all the years of vision this has led up to.

To me, and to us here, I would agree. 
That's not how a regulatory body may see this though, so in another capacity no, Komodo is a team or community of people that are producing software.  

The complicated truth of regulation is that these both might be true until we can show otherwise.

Since there are people that may be targeted to be crushed, which is a very sad truth.  However there may be no crushing to happen, this may all be a non-issue.  We just don't know at this point, that's complete transparency, it's best to be prepared though.

@ejuliano 

THIS IS ONE OF THE BIG QUESTIONS ^ and one of the right ones. 
and yes some of what's in question is the ICO, 
the non-kyc aml dex's for erc20 tokens have their own issues, similar to this they have to face. 

Questions about geo-blocking and regulations.  Who owns the servers, where is the liability, things of this nature. 
And it takes time for the bodies to act on things, but when they do, they are persistant and relentless. 
That's why taking precautions can help 'buy time', and keep us safe until we're sure there's nothing we could be acted on against.

I think one of the things that's difficult about this conversation is that there is a lot of fear over what that means.  Atm that doesn't mean anything other than 'we're trying to be prepared' in the event there is a regulatory shitstorm that comes down here.

KYC-AML and regulatory compliance only came up as a possible issue that we may have to deal with in the past few days.  This has a lot to do with moving into Q4 and the coming announcement of Beta release, along with the landscape of uniswap and other non-KYC/AML places drawing extra attention.

We should wait for more info. There has been some legal advise given to our team and we don't know all the details. This is an ongoing issue.

I really don't know about the legal side and what the setup should be. What you guys are saying kind of makes sense. However, I am sure there's a big difference between Ethereum devs (who maintain a "computer" that can execute anything) and Komodo core devs (who build specific backend software for a DEX network).

I think the key issue here is the DEX Core itself and how the regulatory bodies and enforces would come after people/entity that created it. Unless it's built by an anonymous team we have a problem, or am I wrong?

@ca333 mate, what are you talking about? honestly asking is what I'm saying not clear? My assumptions? I'm sharing my concerns for the developers and investors in this situation. I have said this multiple times before, I understand the need for an entity that exists to handle much of this. I know AtomicDEX is feeding DEX revenues. I've brought this up again and again over the years, what Komodo does with revenues from things like Antara Composer, who is in charge of it, `It should be clear how Komodo actually functions as a community/entity/project`

So don't try and belittle me or derogate from my concerns by claiming my privacy skews my judgement.

> You ask us to "separate", "stand up our entity", and so on but do you understand the implications of this? Clearly not as you would not ask for it. Do you want us to demonstrate these implications? I believe no is the answer.

To shed light into the darkness and answer your above questions for transparency - yes, Komodo team built AtomicDEX mostly with Komodo resources - and looking on the situation from external standpoint there is no benefit for KMD other than technical compatibility. 

From legal perspective maybe the DEX revs should go to Komodo hodlers instead or Komodo should charge DEX hodlers and project lead (whoever this is)? Maybe DEX should have never be built with Komodo resources and the Komodo devs. There are many legal questions we never asked ourselfs before - obviously we were busy occupied developing the technology.

And if this should be truly separated it is clear - AtomicDEX must be a separate project with a separate legal entity and no relation to Komodo and Komodo developers. It should have its own team. As such we would not have to even think about compliance problems. 

But the reality looks radical different to us.

@ca333 I think the point @Regnar is making is that the Team/Entity and the software are 2 different things. I know you know what we mean. 

Just as blockstream pays bitcoin devs, blockstream isn't responsible for bitcoin users that use the software/network illegally. Just since Komodo Entity funds were used to pay atomicDEX devs doesn't mean atomicDEX-API has to comply with regulations, because it's just software. 

To me it seems like the DEX token which makes revenue from fees and pays out to holders is the main issue. Is there a way for the Komodo Entity (official registered business or whatever) to be responsible for DEX payouts conforming to govt regulations and such without changing the the core code to do so?

An example would be to say, DEX holders will not get paid any revshares unless they register KYC with the Komodo Entity. This way the Komodo Entity can provide proper records for any govt or financial body and only send out revshare payments to users who have completely the forms without putting the restrictions at the software level.

DEX asset seems to be at issue. Can DEX revenues be separated from core? Let  third party collect revenues


[06-Oct-20 03:15 PM] ca333#0333
Providing the DEX service has legal implications @lightspeed393 - i.e. if we want to separate the one from other means Komodo can only provide the software/protocol - as according to AML rules we could not provide enduser applications, network infrastructure, and so on.
In such case we must also remove the revenue structure ref. the security token problem/dividends.

i.e. then it would be a pure DEX protocol/software and it would be up to others to implement enduser applications on top of it to achieve compliance.

Removing the DEX fee and revenues from the code is possible and technically very easy @‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª - but the DEX and revshare assets hodlers will not like this idea to detach the one from other. It destroy their dream and expectation they waited half decade for it.

So, separate the two to protect the community from this security token issue, and those that issued these tokens should develop their application on top of it. If it's a separate entity that hires a bunch of Komodo devs, that's fine too. Then add their DEX asset fees into their GUI, and push bug fixes back upstream.

@lightspeed393 

The WordPress stores themselves in this analogy may interact with money but they are not money handlers.


[06-Oct-20 03:28 PM] Jcharming#2693
This is the issue we are facing with the atomic dex who is the money handler?  Who bears responsibility for the transactions taking place.

@NutellaLicka 

I'm not sure if I agree that this constitutes Komodo going corporate.  It's still a community of developers and the AtomicDEX is one of the products being developed on the core technology.  
If the choice is between become a target for a regulatory body or add some compliance measures.  And then develop tech that can navigate around those compliance measures as one of the outcomes.  

Then the latter is surely better.

I have all the respect in the world for you ca333, the way you handled the hacker attack was incredible. I don't envy you and the decision you are having to make, you will inevitably have to disappoint either the revenue people or komodo ecosystem community. I wish you luck.

@Regnar 

Separating the two may be a great solution.  Incorporating the assets later into Dex fees on the GUI level could work.  The GUI level will still need compliance, but like @polycryptoblog said we're exploring all options.

[06-Oct-20 03:46 PM] Regnar#6164
I have zero issue with many of the Komodo Devs setting up a legal entity to offer products on top of the core and be KYC/AML or w.e. those involved in issuing DEX and other security assets should do/have done that for their protection. The issue is, and has been, with conflating this entity with Komodo the decentralized project. I get that many of the developers are the same, this is common with many companies that are stood up to monetize the work of open source projects, they hire from the experienced dev pool who helped develop it. They then write their own code and sometimes push backward compatible fixes upstream. 

The reality is AtomicDEX is a joint funded project. Devs were paid by individuals, investors, a company, as well as simply volunteered to build it. You could argue that more work was done by paid devs but this still doesn't change the fact that it is an open source project, and Komodo is an open source project.

[06-Oct-20 03:49 PM] Regnar#6164
These boundaries need to be drawn, and the things that need to be regulated, e.g. business operations, should be. But they should not be integrated directly into Komodo platform code base. The DEX fee should be removed from the code, and DEX fee should be incorporated into GUI only. That can be continued by this other entity.


[06-Oct-20 03:51 PM] Regnar#6164
the DEX holders can take solice in the fact that the primary development of AtomicDEX GUI will be sending fees to their DEX address, just as it is now. But it is a regulatory nightmare that will likely end in the DEX asset yielding absolutely nothing, if it is left as is.


[06-Oct-20 03:52 PM] Jcharming#2693
Okay I don't disagree that this is a viable option.  I know for sure it's one on the table as a possibility. 

Drawing boundaries maybe more complicated than you realize as there is so much crossover between Komodo AtomicDEX and the devs like you stated earlier.  

I'm not entirely sure about your concern of things being added to the Komodo code base which shouldn't be If you'd like to elaborate that might help.


[06-Oct-20 03:53 PM] Jcharming#2693
Whoever develops the Dex GUI will still have to engage in that regulatory communication.  Which are also going to be the same people that are developing the AtomicDEX.  
So I'm not sure how this solves certain things there.


[06-Oct-20 03:54 PM] Jcharming#2693
If you feel this is something that should be championed it's also possible for you to fork the code and begin building an asset free version if that's kind of what you're talking about.  And then building a GUI on top of it yourself.


[06-Oct-20 03:54 PM] Jcharming#2693
I'm not sure if that's in line with what you're saying, but I think it's a good thing to point out?


[06-Oct-20 03:55 PM] Regnar#6164
It solves it by not making Komodo platform and KMD, beholden to the same regulatory pressures that the DEX fee holders are seeing, because they are not acting as a platform that is provided revenues to an unregistered security


[06-Oct-20 03:57 PM] Jcharming#2693
At the moment I don't think Komodo platform and KMD are beholden However the developers of the AtomicDEX are.  
I'm just trying to follow along with the way that you're talking about it maybe this helps?


[06-Oct-20 03:57 PM] Regnar#6164
> Whoever develops the Dex GUI will still have to engage in that regulatory communication
This is exactly my point, the DEX GUI should be dealing with this, AtomicDEX GUI needs to be separated from AtomicDEX API. It is clear now, I'm sure, that there is no longer room for them both to exist in the current state on Komodo platform. The underlying software, the API, will not survive any type of legal or regulatory scrutiny if it generates revenue, especially revenue that is paid out to an unregistered security.

We will discuss solutions on technical side with the whole team - technical solutions which we have not seriously considered yet such as removing fee-address and revs-structure around the tech. i.e. removing all financial liabilities from code and so on as it felt like a "no-go" topic. But this could be a viable solution for the open-source side and Komodo. On the next steps and to make the SN legacy investors happy the legal entity could run a fork of the DEX tech with the fee-structure and a full retrospective KYC for revsshare hodlers and thus legal compliance with all its pros and cons. DEX company would build product on top of Komodo technology but independent and without becoming liability for Komodo. 

I believe this is a viable path forward which makes Komodo community very happy and DEX community happy too.

Another concern would be if AtomicDEX API ever wants to be the core engine of a 3rd party business or Exchange. DEX holders were counting on the base of all GUIs still paying DEX fees, then having GUIs charge fees on top. 

A Problem with this is, if you are trying to use the engine for your business, and were going to actually implement KYC or use it as an OTC desk or something, you'd likely get raked over the coals by regulators questioning why you're supporting sending fees to an unregistered security with profits from that going to anyone in the world.


[06-Oct-20 07:43 PM] Regnar#6164
So then they have to fork the code and remove the DEX fee anyway. It seems that the core, like most open source stuff, shouldn't have financials and paid portions hard coded in, that stuff is added to it when a company or something provides that product to their customers with other value added, like 24 hour support, better looking GUI, more features etc


[06-Oct-20 07:46 PM] polycryptoblog#1173

In Komodo codebase itself, which was one of the key issues, whether this geo IP blocking should take place within the core AtomicDEX Code offered by Komodo, or if it should take place at GUI level offered by a 3rd party company that is stood up with the goal of revenue, providing fees to DEX, and being compliant with, I assume US laws.

God morning XD me sleeping did not help on my headache lol. But I will say this I have put in my life savings into jl777 assets from pengea to dex. I have done that over a period of three years. I vote for spitting it up like ca333 suggestd. the dex protocol is to important for the world to be taken over by greed


[06-Oct-20 08:29 PM] Regnar#6164
@hastrup I would assume the dominant GUI, Atomicdex Pro would still use DEX fees, probably at the GUI level, and most of the trading volume would probably still exist there unless another GUI comes along


[06-Oct-20 08:30 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
The issue that if it becomes a security it might not be tradable. Unless even more govt bullshit is gone through ( aka ‚Äúgoing public‚Äù) . Not an issue if you are like me and weren‚Äôt planning on selling.

@Regnar it better be using dex fee structure. but the tech behind it should use a burn addy

[06-Oct-20 08:33 PM] Regnar#6164
I'm not sold on burn addresses tbh. I think there is probably a better solution out there for it. The GUI fee makes sense, but the DEX fee, I floated an idea (don't know how technically feasible) which was replace the DEX fee address with the address of the market maker you're trading against, and call it a "negative fee" or something. Haven't really fleshed that out too much tbh


[06-Oct-20 08:33 PM] mobipoi#5774
@Mark81  change should be decided by asset holders who payed for the project


[06-Oct-20 08:34 PM] Regnar#6164
I think it's a bit more complicated than that though


[06-Oct-20 08:36 PM] mobipoi#5774
@hastrup  it all well and good so long as majority holder vote  approves don't think every holder share your sentiments


[06-Oct-20 08:36 PM] Regnar#6164
Like who paid, who worked on it additionally, who donated to devs, who donated time, who helped testing, bug finding, marketing, design planning, etc. Who paid for it is much more complicated than it sounds. 

Then how do you know a DEX hodler funded the project, vs bought DEX after the initial funds went to the team? Buying Amazon stock now doesn't fund Amazon


[06-Oct-20 08:37 PM] hastrup#8742
But I understand that before dex would get all of the revenue with this it will "only" be a small cut but that is a easy price to pay considering ppl need the freedom to transact freely with no central place  demanding rules. One thing could be illegal in one country but is completely legal in the next it not up to komodo to find out what's what it must be the user using the protocol


[06-Oct-20 08:38 PM] hastrup#8742
@mobipoi no I think you are right but it's the moral right thing to do. The software is to important

Let keep it simple here,  DEx asset raised funds  for development expense. We placed cash inside that also payed for the prototype you see money don't grow on trees, and also you forget fees are used to buy KMD

Perhaps the regulatory landscape will change in the near future. Compliance costs could be covered by the dex revenue until some arbitrary number like 500k swaps. At which point asset purpose will be re-evaluated and there may be enough regulatory clarity to do things on the up and up and make sure all the right govt palms get greased. Officially they are frozen and worthless but the chains are still functional off somewhere far away from the app store. As it stands, the only thing that gives these assets any value whatsoever is faith. Maybe that could be capitalized on to buy some time.

DEX
> I suggested he start offering to consolidate these various assets and replace them with DEX to simplify things. He didn't like that idea at all, but if he is going to have to make them legal securities, it might have to happen
@Regnar  above all else I entirely agree with this, it will absolutely make life easier for investors, a unifed One Dex asset  clear and simple which will aid the logistics of any entity structure that may be needed and allows investors that hold multiple Dex earner asset to comply with whatever is thrown at them @ca333 or @jl777c  hopefully this please is taken into account


[07-Oct-20 01:42 AM] ca333#0333
We will most certainly move forward with https://discord.com/channels/412898016371015680/705374203972419616/763173585002168360 - it will remove conflict of interests and a lot of the legal certainty on the KMD side. But this also means that the DEX/revsshare asset holders are left out in the rain until "someone" launches a legal entity around this to legalise the security token and structure, handle KYC with investors, comply with AML for the everyday operations and so on. These parties are going to rely on this future entity to build a product which generates revenues - I believe it is clear we can not handle this part nor get involved in it.

[07-Oct-20 05:04 AM] Regnar#6164
We've definitely talked a lot about the negatives this past day, but I'd also like to bring up some of the positives.

If this dev heavy entity is stood up and continues to actively develop Komodo open source on top of their products, it would actually give the Komodo community another company or legal entity to make contracts, build revenues, build products and make partnerships with other businesses and venture capital firms. It's not very easy for a business to make a partnership or buy products and services from a decentralized group, giving them the option of choosing to cook their own solutions with the open source free stuff, or to contract out the work to a company whose employees were some of the core builders and maintainers of that code and software, is a huge plus. 

It is often far less expensive to allocate money for a fixed cost contract as opposed to estimating if your current labor force will be able to adequately adapt to this new software and build a product in a timely manner and up to the same standards. They pay salary, benefits, possible overtime, training costs, hiring devs that fill the gap, design new KPIs, and have to adjust their reporting methods to properly measure those KPIs and their effectiveness. This costs a lot more than hiring the guys who built it.

This leads us to partnerships and funding. After figuring out their securities obligations, this entity could then raise outside capital from firms who specialize in tech and are looking to get their feet into the blockchain space.

[07-Oct-20 05:04 AM] Regnar#6164
Properly separating the open source software community from this company will also be important for those devs who do not wish to contribute to a company's code, or who are privacy advocates and champions of p2p and privacy tech. They should not have to look at Komodo and think it is either KYC or nothing, because many of us do not live in those countries where this KYC is necessary. 

This will also mean that with greater funding opportunities, this entity could hire more diverse devs who specialize in things outside the cores capabilities, and these new advancements can still be pushed upstream to Komodo Core and be used by the community. For example hiring WASM experts, more Rust coders, etc.

I lost the overview tbh...how does the anarcho version differs in terms of ‚Äûpossible‚Äú legal problems? If Atomic Dex is a legal problem for KMD, Anarcho have the same Problem.

Notary nodes and AtomicDEX aren't the same though, I would imagine some of this new entity would include current notary nodes (not sure what that would mean for the decentralization argument, multiple notaries being employed by the same entity) but really notary nodes simply secure KMD to BTC. I would liken it, in a legal sense, to mining. 

They aren't facilitating atomic swaps, nor are they offering that software. They are securing the KMD asset to BTC. I don't think there would be any real trouble for a public notary node, or a private notary node.

They way it is implemented makes notaries hingepin for continued trust of exchanges


[07-Oct-20 06:57 AM] daemonfox#6136
it is mining


[07-Oct-20 06:57 AM] daemonfox#6136
the earnings are easy mined


[07-Oct-20 06:58 AM] Regnar#6164
The ICO funds though will likely need to be handled in a better legal way, like forming a trust or something that has legal and fiduciary responsibility to keep BTC flowing to NNs for notarization costs. This process as far as I'm aware has never been a problem, but it still might be better to set up a distributed trust to "handle this" less a regulator gets it in their mind that some person conducted the ICO and has control of the funds, and therefore these notary nodes are "paid employees"

Again, that is for a lawyer to clear up


[07-Oct-20 06:58 AM] daemonfox#6136
The question is, do those rewards earned get considered as receiving payment for powering the network used for an unregulated DEX


[07-Oct-20 06:59 AM] daemonfox#6136
Without KMD backing the chain there is no DEX


[07-Oct-20 06:59 AM] Regnar#6164
I don't think NNs are going away, nor would they be in any legally difficult spot, as long as they abide by their local laws and report their "mining earnings" or w.e. they need to do


[07-Oct-20 06:59 AM] daemonfox#6136
without notaries, KMD is just another PoW chain to be exploited.


[07-Oct-20 07:01 AM] Regnar#6164
> The question is, do those rewards earned get considered as receiving payment for powering the network used for an unregulated DEX 

No I don't think this, as a legal argument, holds any water. This would no more be the case than saying BTC miners are facilitating the AtomicDEX trades because they mine the BTC transactions. Atomic swaps are on each chain.


[07-Oct-20 07:02 AM] Regnar#6164
There is clear separation between Atomicdex and the notary nodes, both in function and purpose


[07-Oct-20 07:02 AM] daemonfox#6136
Id agree with your assessment there but on the opposite side... In the eyes of regulators, yes BTC miners are culpable too.


[07-Oct-20 07:04 AM] daemonfox#6136
I mean take a look at the new docs for US taxes this year...


[07-Oct-20 07:04 AM] daemonfox#6136

[07-Oct-20 07:05 AM] daemonfox#6136
It would be the same as if we were running a distributed network to power the NYSE, being paid, but anyone can put w/e tjhey want on it


[07-Oct-20 07:06 AM] Regnar#6164
Sure, but it's been pretty well established that miners mine transactions, and report their income just like any other form of revenue, and their expenses the same. 

There is, as far as I know, no legal precedent set that states miners are responsible for the transactions they are mining. I don't even think they are responsible for particular pools they are in


[07-Oct-20 07:06 AM] daemonfox#6136
They would want us to restrict entry to that network like they do now and know end to end who is on it

@Regnar this is accurate except, they repealed net neutrality which makes this a very real issue now


[07-Oct-20 07:07 AM] Regnar#6164
No, I don't think that holds water. There is a clear difference between mining transactions, and facilitating trading software


[07-Oct-20 07:08 AM] daemonfox#6136
there is nothing preventing service providers from being forced to reveal their users with out the protections net neutrality gave US citizens


[07-Oct-20 07:10 AM] Regnar#6164
I think you are going in the wrong direction on this. Regulators are becoming more aware of the intricacies of decentralized networks, especially blockchains. Regulators are more so targeting the user level interactions that are run by companies, especially those generating profits. Ie. Coinbase, Bittrex, etc. They are shying away from directly targeting the network itself.


[07-Oct-20 07:11 AM] daemonfox#6136
Thats the hope


[07-Oct-20 07:11 AM] daemonfox#6136
and yes I know I am going to the extreme deep end


[07-Oct-20 07:11 AM] daemonfox#6136
its what I do lol


[07-Oct-20 07:11 AM] daemonfox#6136
The last thing I expect is for the regulators to spend all their money trying to hunt down individuals and sue a distributed open source network


[07-Oct-20 07:12 AM] daemonfox#6136
But the concern of what they believe and what is really true about what we do is shocking stark in contrast


[07-Oct-20 07:13 AM] Regnar#6164
Because that is the level they can control. I'm willing to bet US regulators are not going to pass regulations that ban network level activities that end up causing a form of centralized control of the largest Cryptocurrency network, to miners in China. 

As much as some of them hate Bitcoin, they hate that idea more


[07-Oct-20 07:14 AM] daemonfox#6136

Again, regulators have a mission and oversight, it isn't to stifle invention (though they sometimes do that) and it isn't to catch everything, it is to regulate the bottlenecks that they can actually afford to regulate. 

But they are not in isolation, they still have other things holding them accountable, and those things are pro invention and innovation, and pro change.

So they will continue to target the easier, but also more meaningful targets. Those facing US citizens, and those directly dealing with USD

[07-Oct-20 07:19 AM] daemonfox#6136
Behind ALL of that, their agenda is KYC... accountability, driven by the want to tax.

@polycryptoblog How does that fix KYC being the #1 thing the US is going after? its pushing KYC/AML and a US based non GeoBlocking version still needs KYC and AML to meet the requirements Bitmex was just charged over.

If US users are not allowed to use the application, no need to comply with US laws. At least that is the theory

If US users choose to hide their identity, that is on them. Dex just needs to prove 'reasonable efforts'


[07-Oct-20 09:32 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
the geoblock is in place because the reference clients which are released in the EU, which there is a rather vague clause in some recent regulation that requires kycaml for arranging crypto2crypto trades,  this clause seems to contradict the common exemption of being communication/network service provider.   The US does not have this clause , thus no kycaml requirement.  geoblock is a just a good faith measure to prevent legal issues.   Any mainstream/ legitimate client will eventually have to undergo this, and most likely more like black/white listing.   it seems to be the way the world is going.  However as open source software,  there is nothing we can do if someone edits the code to remove the block and any other code they dont like.  Thats the whole point of OSS.  But to suggest that public people who have built up this project should face legal troubles because of the reference client is not a viable way forward.

@polycryptoblog great, someone said otherwise (which is why I quoted them) so good to hear.


[09-Oct-20 09:58 AM] sakata#4279
Sorry if this has already been mentioned or covered.

But is there anyway that the notarization process can be bypassed?

In other words, is there a method so that a DEX's transactions can be fed directly into a mempool?

Apologies for the ignorance.


[09-Oct-20 10:21 AM] Slyris#2880
You mean in atomicdex desktop @sakata 

Yes of course there is a way since 0.2.1 you can use personal settings conf when placing an order, if both part disable dpow checks the time of a swap is drastically reduced.


[09-Oct-20 10:23 AM] sakata#4279
@Slyris Thank you

So what risks would that inherit, precisely? If you don't mind üôÇ


[09-Oct-20 10:25 AM] Slyris#2880
Well to be honest you still have one confirmation from both Blockchain, but basically I suppose that some makers prefer to have the dpow security to feel more safe. Lot of makers act as OTC with big trade amounts, they prefer to enjoy dpow security I guess this is mater of taste, I personally believe one blockchain confirmation is enough


[09-Oct-20 10:31 AM] sakata#4279
So there wouldn't be an issue if each chain had a different confirmation time? For example, someone making a transaction on the dex where their coin's chain has a longer block time against the coin they are looking to receive, and once the coin they are trading *for* is confirmed (and subsequently they have the funds) they decide to exit/close the connection - therefore they then have access to both funds.

Does this make sense? Does the dex act as an escrow between the two? Hope I'm not asking for too much üòÑ

please do this only for very small test-trades - not relying on dPoW or sufficient block confs is a BIG security risk and *not* just _a matter of taste_ !

@Slyris Its all fine and well understanding the theory of atomic swaps, but the system that implements it will always be a different story

I would be happy to write an explanation if I felt comfortable with understanding the app fully!

@tolken  @LocoMB Hi guys.  To answer your questions:  Lots of things.  I have spent the last couple of years exiting the U.S. Corporation and so have been more tuned in to things than most.  I am going to mention several things, most without links, but anyone interested can easily find things on the internet.  I would use non-Google search engine/browser, as I think Google may have an interest in burying related search results.  I like DuckDuckGo/Brave Browser.

(1) The Quantum Grammar --  Russell-Jay : Gould and David-Wynn : Miller https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1278795646074589185.html 

(2) Reports from individuals with inside contacts in the government including President Trump's team.  One of these individuals is an unassuming gentleman named Charles (Charlie) Ward.  His YouTube channels keep getting shut down.  Find him at https://www.bitchute.com/channel/pqlCrTAephy6/  and  https://drcharlieward.com/

(3) People such as (2) have made it clear that early in his administration, President Trump secured the loyalty of all the major countries.  With their help, The Trump team are

(4) Taking down the world-wide Deep State/Cabal.  The first step was removing the Venetians.  The second step was to arrest everyone in the Vatican:  650 plane loads of  documents, cash, silver/gold, ... have been removed from the Vatican.  The third step was to remove the royal family from Buckingham Palace, which is being gone over by 100s of people with a fine-toothed comb, so to speak.  While I have not heard anyone say it directly, it does appear that the royal family have been arrested.

(5) The Trump team and the U.S. Marines have been arresting anyone connected with human trafficking, pedophilia, SRA (Satanic Ritual Abuse), ..., and freeing people -- mainly children -- from their prisons and torture.  The vast majority of these people have been kept underground.  I understand that close to a million children have been freed in Australia alone.

(6) NESARA/GESARA (the financial reset and more) will remove banking as we know it.  It will institute asset-backed (gold/silver) currency that has direct counterparts on the QFS blockchain.  The QFS blockchain is active now, and the old SWIFT system is "on life support."  Any nation that attacks another nation will be kicked out of the GESARA club, so to speak, and will not be able to participate in international commerce using this system.  There are multiple quadrillions of dollars that have been freed to fund infrastructures, retired people, and to make up for decades of theft from all peoples.  People in Africa, for instance, have had their nations' wealth stolen.  Also people that pay income taxes will have some or all of that restored to them, since the funds taken in income taxes went to the families running the world (Venetians and others).  There is much more.

(7) President Trump has talked multiple times about "restoring your freedoms" and "de-classifying the classified patents."

(8) Others that know or have known Mr. Trump say that he will restore the Republic in the States and that they are looking forward to Constitutional/Common Law being instituted in their countries.

(9) In America, the de facto (corporate) government must legally give way to the de jure (original) government when that government exists.  American now has a properly and legally populated Republic.

More I am sure.  LOL


[10-Oct-20 03:48 AM] suhthern-girl#8418
(10) Oh, Trump, Putin, Modi, and Xi are working together to remove the Deep States in their own countries.  I understand that the leaders of the CCP (Communist Party in China), for instance, have been taken down.

(11) The MSM (Mainstream Media) will be taken down last.

In Turkey we are not forced to add the restrictions that will need to be added by the Komodo team and would be happy to host a version of atomicDEX desktop in our repo. 

As you know, MCL on Marmara Chain is designed to run in real economy. We have so many projects that we will share with you. I believe this Version will easily make AtomicDex desktop a perfect DeFi system with dApps to run in real economy. We have two official offices now in ƒ∞stanbul, one in Technopark ƒ∞stanbul, the greatest Technopark in Turkey, and the second nearby businesses and several universities. We are ready to help with my team.

I do have to downvote switching the columns on the bid side... having the bid and ask price columns next to each other felt better to me :-(.
That and the funky looking background-lit buttons are the only two negatives I can see, and the second may be just a matter of getting used to as well.

i guess the error is because the coin is already in the coins file: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins/blob/master/coins#L3173


[29-Oct-20 12:56 PM] Slyris#2880
In this case it's working too


[29-Oct-20 12:57 PM] Slyris#2880
We verify that


[29-Oct-20 12:58 PM] cipi#4502
entry in coins file does not have `mm2` set to `1`, because it wasn't tested in mm2


[29-Oct-20 01:03 PM] Slyris#2880
Oh I see


[29-Oct-20 01:03 PM] Slyris#2880
You should propose a change for that


[29-Oct-20 01:04 PM] Slyris#2880
I don't get the idea to have coins disabled in the coins file imo


[29-Oct-20 01:06 PM] cipi#4502
the easiest way is to add `mm2:1` when enabling the coin...
but i don't know how the code is dealing with coins that are already in the coins file... overwriting BTC with some ERC20-token with same symbol wouldn't be a good idea üòÑ


[29-Oct-20 01:07 PM] Slyris#2880
Yeah I think the same


[29-Oct-20 01:07 PM] Slyris#2880
The app check if the entry already exists


[29-Oct-20 01:07 PM] Slyris#2880
And don't add anything


[29-Oct-20 01:08 PM] cipi#4502
you can use the mm2:1 setting in the enable call too, i do this when testing new coins
don't need to change the other values
just do `curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"enable\",\"coin\":\"STORJ\",\"urls\":[\"http://eth1.cipig.net:8555\",\"http://eth2.cipig.net:8555\",\"http://eth3.cipig.net:8555\"],\"swap_contract_address\":\"0x8500AFc0bc5214728082163326C2FF0C73f4a871\",\"gas_station_url\":\"https://ethgasstation.info/json/ethgasAPI.json\",\"mm2\":1}"`


[29-Oct-20 01:09 PM] Slyris#2880
Yeah but after the release it's to late :p


[29-Oct-20 01:11 PM] cipi#4502
btw, nobody has checked if the entries in the coins file are still valid, eg if erc20 contract addresses have changed, so no guarantee for the entries without mm2 set to 1... maybe we should simply remove all these coins from the coins file


[29-Oct-20 01:15 PM] lightspeed393#5403
I checked recently and some of the erc20's without mm2=1 do indeed have different contract addresses now


[29-Oct-20 01:19 PM] cipi#4502
i will remove them, makes no sense to have outdated entries there... and it also doesn't let people add those coins manually


[29-Oct-20 01:59 PM] Slyris#2880

what do you mean @Deleted User for the OSX binaries for example ?

it's planned to have official OSX sign app products but this require some times, keep in mind it's still a beta, for a stable release you will have installer, and signed bundle ofc


[29-Oct-20 03:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
I mean on desktop app


[29-Oct-20 03:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
they sign it from Verus Foundation Releases@ or something, with the sig and in their app you can verify that ID signed the package you downloaded


[29-Oct-20 03:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
so say someone got access to the repo and released a compromised binary, people can check if it is legit or not


[29-Oct-20 03:50 PM] Slyris#2880
You have few intern check done by us in the app

@Slyris
It has uses other places too. 
How about when I am the one providing the liquidity in BTC or ETH-tokens? 
I stopped putting bids for KMD on the BTC/KMD pair after I had a few 'people' sell me 50 KMD or less... with some nice BTC fees attached...


[30-Oct-20 02:14 AM] jansako#3330
Please implement a custom 'min order size'.


[30-Oct-20 02:22 AM] t_dan#3334
> Please implement a custom 'min order size'.
@jansako Yes, this is also what I find annoying sometimes. You place an order in a specific size, and people start taking the order in absurd fragments of 0.7 KMD or something, and you have only hassle with fees and documenting all those "pseudo" trades.


[30-Oct-20 02:28 AM] jansako#3330
A number of people are just testing, trying what this thing does so I understand why there are small trades. Could also be people testing bots or just getting rid of dust coins. I just don't want to be the one paying for it when they use high tx-fee coins. Personally I do not mind small transactions on many pairs, but the point @t_dan is making is valid as well.

So...here i am again...i 
Have a lot of problems with new release
1. Long time waiting (15 minutes at step "enabling assets...")  with kaspersky on and off

2. Add  a coin (for example chips or dex) doesnt work....nothing happened

Update: after restart of adex the coin is there

3. I add a erc-20 token (sushi swap) but adex has proplems to load it (mismatch at SUSHI custom asset configuration)


[30-Oct-20 03:40 AM] cipi#4502

I had similar issues with Kasperski in the previous releases. At the end I had to elevate access and force-exclude mm2 and the desktop.exe from every protection I could find. Not even sure what worked, but at the end it did. Now I installed DEX on a PC without Kasperski...


[30-Oct-20 10:39 AM] lightspeed393#5403
Thanks, let me check the electrums


[30-Oct-20 10:40 AM] cipi#4502
i get "connection refused"
btw, good way to check electrums: `(echo '{ "id": 1, "method": "server.version", "params": ["AtomicDEX", ["1.4", "2.0"]] }'; sleep 0.5) | ncat electrum1.spaceworks.co 50001`


[30-Oct-20 10:42 AM] lightspeed393#5403
They are down, odd since it was working a few minutes ago. Restarting them now. Any idea @cipi what would cause electrumx to stop? First I've seen of that happening.


[30-Oct-20 10:45 AM] cipi#4502
yes, likely because you need to compact the database from time to time, else it will stop working... depends on the number of blocks, so fast block coins will need to be compacted more often than others
you need to stop electrum, call `COIN=Komodo DB_DIRECTORY=/electrumdb/KMD electrumx_compact_history` and than restart again, replace KMD with SPACE


[30-Oct-20 10:47 AM] cipi#4502
this will not be necessary any more in the future, they recently made some commits... but i haven't tried it yet, since it is a completely new DB schema, which means complete resync (i guess)... will wait a bit longer and see if others have problems with the new schema before i switch


[30-Oct-20 10:50 AM] cipi#4502
oh, i see they haven't merged all the changes, this is just a draft: https://github.com/spesmilo/electrumx/pull/65


[30-Oct-20 10:54 AM] lightspeed393#5403
thanks for the info. `electrumx_compact_history` is giving me errors, so it might be down for a bit til i get it working/possibly resynced


[30-Oct-20 10:57 AM] cipi#4502
the alternative is to delete the electrum DB completely and restart... it will rebuild the DB... should not take that long, since SPACE is relatively new, so not that many blocks

[31-Oct-20 03:14 AM] jansako#3330
I saw a strange one today:
- I had a maker order partially filled, everything is OK
- Then another part of it was filled, the amounts and wallet records are fine
- The issue: The second partial swap does not appear in the swap history! (yes, I have the filters disabled & all that :-)

I have partial swaps happen often enough in the past, never seen this before.
Don't ask me for the swap ID cause the swap is not listed in my DexPro... 
0.3, Win 10 edition, BTW.


[31-Oct-20 03:16 AM] jansako#3330
Just to state it very clear. The swap itself happened fine, trade completed etc, the issue is only that it does not show up in my Recent Swaps.


[31-Oct-20 03:17 AM] jansako#3330

@smkhound can you help on this one ^


[31-Oct-20 03:25 AM] jansako#3330
Pretty sure it is 'just' a UI issue


[31-Oct-20 03:25 AM] Slyris#2880
You have filters ALL-ALL ?


[31-Oct-20 03:25 AM] jansako#3330
yep


[31-Oct-20 03:25 AM] Slyris#2880
You think somehow your orders is excluded from the view ?

Ok come in dm i will try to help you


[31-Oct-20 03:26 AM] jansako#3330
there is nothing to 'do', I am not missing any coins or anything. I was just reporting a possible UI bug. Unless others can see the same thing, or you can reproduce is, there is nothing to 'troubleshoot

[31-Oct-20 03:28 AM] Slyris#2880
hmm indeed strange


[31-Oct-20 03:30 AM] Slyris#2880
I would be interested if it's appear tommorow or later


[31-Oct-20 03:30 AM] jansako#3330
I have a 'box' for these at work: 'unconfirmed one-off reports'. Once there is more than one, or you see it yourself, you will know where to start


[31-Oct-20 03:32 AM] jansako#3330
I have another swap on 10/31 already, I also first though it is because the filter is displaying 'up to 30/10/2020 & you cannot select '31/10/2020'.


[31-Oct-20 03:32 AM] jansako#3330
let me grab a screenie...


[31-Oct-20 03:33 AM] Slyris#2880
Then we have the answer


[31-Oct-20 03:34 AM] Slyris#2880
i can select 31/10/2020

That's rly strange you should be able to select 31/10/2020


[31-Oct-20 03:35 AM] jansako#3330
yeah, you can see a swap from 31/10 on the list


[31-Oct-20 03:35 AM] Slyris#2880
What happens if you enable filter and try to click on it


[31-Oct-20 03:35 AM] Slyris#2880
yes because filter are disabled


[31-Oct-20 03:35 AM] Slyris#2880
if it's disable you can see it


[31-Oct-20 03:36 AM] jansako#3330
when enabled & I open the callendar, the 31st is highlighted with green & I cannot select it


[31-Oct-20 03:37 AM] jansako#3330
And I cannot select tomorrow either


[31-Oct-20 03:37 AM] jansako#3330
So if the issue is withthe filter, how come the other swap from today is showing on the list?


[31-Oct-20 03:37 AM] Slyris#2880
and if you go more in the future regarding the left calendar


[31-Oct-20 03:37 AM] jansako#3330
It does not let me go more than October


[31-Oct-20 03:37 AM] Slyris#2880
that's strange just tested on all platform you can even select 2021 for me


[31-Oct-20 03:38 AM] jansako#3330
the arrow it highlighting, it just does not scroll over to Nov or Dec


[31-Oct-20 03:38 AM] Slyris#2880
yeah but even 31 october should be selectable


[31-Oct-20 03:39 AM] Slyris#2880
it's even a tooltip "current day"


[31-Oct-20 03:39 AM] jansako#3330

[31-Oct-20 03:42 AM] Slyris#2880

for a long term, atomic swaps have been an exciting concept because it can support trading across two ledgers (btc to eth, and eth to btc). they never really took off because the co-ordination is too difficult / it is way easier just to trade on the same ledger (ethereum).

AtomicDEX showed notification of withdraw when moving UTXOs in Verus desktop wallet --- guessing SPV ports and or or or or something is the same...freaked me out. I changed my underwear, I am ok now


[02-Nov-20 10:56 PM] alkimi#1111
is that the same issue that causes all mining software to get flagged? Is it just looking for tunnel construction code? Anyone know


[03-Nov-20 12:57 AM] smkhound#7640
Kaspersky have not responded to submision. reason for flag I think is because mm2 has persistent crypto related connection open

I have a issue with atomicdex 0.3.0 on mac. High CPU usage is really flustrating. Impossible to work under the transaction. My CPU: 2,3 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9.... and the bonus: isn't working with my VPN provider.


[03-Nov-20 10:06 AM] Slyris#2880
The high cpu usage is during a swap @ronyi ?

0.3 Windows version. 
When a partial order fails, the 'failed' amount is removed from the total order size shown on the 'trade' tab.  (the 'orders' tab still shows the full 'original' size.)

Example: 
I have a 1200 VRSC sell order up. Someone is trying to buy & is failing). I now have 2 failed orders in History (one 'failed to negotiate', the other 'TakerFeeValideateFailed'). My 'sell' order size shown on the order books has subtracted the amount for the two failed swaps, but the funds are still available in my wallet. 
I would understand the behavior if the failure happens at a later stage, when the funds have left the Maker wallet. But the funds are still there.
Expected: Restore the order size after a failed swap.


[04-Nov-20 03:09 AM] Oszy#5734
@jansako how long since it's failed? afaik until the timeout expires it'll still be "locked for swap"

@jansako yes maker order are not updated yet in the future I would like to be able to even show all orders related to a maker order it's not a bug it's not implemented yet


[04-Nov-20 03:29 AM] jansako#3330
As it is, it could allow a malicious user to 'clear' all orders above their own... unless there is some sort of auto ban/filter in place to prevent such?


[04-Nov-20 03:32 AM] Oszy#5734
yes this was discussed before.


[04-Nov-20 03:33 AM] Oszy#5734
there is a public key ban for failed swaps until you restart the app i think.  but i don't know the details.


[04-Nov-20 03:35 AM] jansako#3330
That could explain why they are no longer trying to execute an order with me... pretty sure they were not malicious, maybe just a mobile user with bad connection or closing the mobile app after initiating a swap?

[05-Nov-20 12:54 PM] Sudoba#9452
@jansako here's my end goal: instead of using ocean wallet and finding some centralized exchange, I was looking into AtomicDEX as an alternative solution. So I just wanted to try if some swap could be made with my coin and for example KMD/BTC with AtomicDEX. From twitter and some people here I was given some pointers to look into the coins.json file, electrumx and I thought a simple change would give me the opportunity to test this out. But instead I am installing qt now üôÅ


[05-Nov-20 12:58 PM] cipi#4502
if you want to test a completely new coin, it is better to do it with the CLI version, not Desktop... no need to install QT then
have you looked at the README from the coins repo about adding new coins https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins ?
may i ask which coin it is?

i see, so it is already a KMD assetchain, thought some other utxo coins
this makes integration into AtomicDEX easier
but adding it to AtomicDEX Desktop or Mobile requires setting up electrum servers, Desktop and Mobile can't work with native wallet, only AtomicDEX API (CLI)

Hi  how long should it take for a swap to complete. mine seams to to be stuck at 2/3 ?


[10-Nov-20 04:18 AM] cipi#4502
depends on the block time of the coin you are waiting for and the confirmations settings you made... what coin is it?


[10-Nov-20 04:21 AM] cipi#4502
i assume it is `92a408ba-f364-4172-a377-2b46c722eacb` and the tx you are waiting for is https://kmdexplorer.io/tx/c0bc2a7428fc59cc4f36c3eb88b2da4e4fc79c690b223009db663cc8edbd0dec
since it already has 23 confirmations, i assume you are using the default settings, which wait for a notarization... you can simply disable it next time and set it to 5 confirmations instead (without nota)


[10-Nov-20 04:45 AM] Roger#1320
The coin is ILN on Komodo platform https://explorer.ilien.io/ and R2R ecr20 token https://etherscan.io/token/0xc76160ce8e26e0cf61a78a5a749478d22d91461d

maybe the token is incompatible... i don't know it... you need to look into the mm2 logfiles


[10-Nov-20 05:27 AM] cipi#4502
oh, ILN blocks are not mined regularly, last block is 1h ago... logs/console output shows you the tx it waits for and how many confirmations...
the default setting for ILN is to wait for nota: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins/blob/master/coins#L690
i would first disable it and set it to lowest possible value


[10-Nov-20 05:28 AM] Roger#1320
Ok so it looks like it will go through but slowly. its is now 2h 32m into swap


[10-Nov-20 05:30 AM] cipi#4502
problem is that as long as there is no new tx, there will be no new block mined, because afaik ILN is ondemand-mining
so if it still waits for nota/confirmations, it will wait till someone else sends a tx
would be best if ILN team would setup a tx-broadcaster that sends out a new tx every couple minutes or so, so that the chain advances


[10-Nov-20 05:33 AM] Oszy#5734
they had one, it might have stopped

[12-Nov-20 08:37 AM] jansako#3330
Is it 'hanging' on taker payment received cause it is waiting for it to be received?


[12-Nov-20 08:38 AM] dth88#2674
@jansako no, TakerPaymentReceived is a final event


[12-Nov-20 08:39 AM] jansako#3330
? so why are those other entries on the list 'below'?


[12-Nov-20 08:39 AM] Slyris#2880
I think there is new events merged since yesterday


[12-Nov-20 08:39 AM] Oszy#5734
it was recevied long ago only the dex app is not checking it


[12-Nov-20 08:40 AM] Oszy#5734
if someone has a fix before it timeouts i'd be grateful xD

@Oszy 
As far as I understand, maker hasn't received TakerPayment yet.


[12-Nov-20 08:48 AM] sergey.boyko0791#8143
There is `MakerPaymentSent` event only in swap file. So taker could went offline before he sent the Taker Payment

@sergey.boyko0791 it's seems to be the case tbh


[12-Nov-20 08:59 AM] Oszy#5734
@Slyris eth is on the contract. it was sent by the taker


[12-Nov-20 09:01 AM] Oszy#5734
can't i force it to check the payment by editing the json? (adding a step but leave it blank?)


[12-Nov-20 09:28 AM] dth88#2674
not sure how communication between the contract and mm2 happens, but you can try deleting MakerPaymentSent event fully and restart, just a blind guess


[12-Nov-20 09:42 AM] dth88#2674
wait, its ILN with on-demand mining, we just had the case above where guy waited for more than 2 or 3 hours

@dth88 this was sorted out yesterday


[12-Nov-20 09:44 AM] Oszy#5734
swap is under refund now. taker didn't claim makerpayment afterall

So if the fee for a transaction from AtomicDEX is too small does that mean something needs to be done or just wait for whenever the transaction gets its turn, I guess speeding up the transaction is not an option?


[14-Nov-20 09:37 AM] cipi#4502
you can set custom fee when sending


[14-Nov-20 10:03 AM] Khyber#0779
I understand that but I didnt use it for this transaction.


[14-Nov-20 10:04 AM] Khyber#0779
I assumed the default would be fine


[14-Nov-20 10:04 AM] Khyber#0779
Hell I have no problem with 3-5 doge for transfer


[14-Nov-20 01:25 PM] Khyber#0779
is it possible to delete a transaction to resend with appropriate fees?

both are btc based forks, and one seed will generate same address for matching protocols.

just as all KMD smart chains have the same address generated off the same seed


[17-Nov-20 03:27 AM] gcharang#6833
full technical: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Technical_background_of_version_1_Bitcoin_addresses
the step that usually differs for different crypto networks is the 4th one (4 - Add version byte in front of RIPEMD-160 hash (0x00 for Main Network)) different networks have different values in place of `0x00`. coincidentally doge and dgb have same value

Using windows10 and defender + firewall both allowing connections through atm.

@Jcharming It's maybe possible during the first connection when allowing firewall if you got blocked before let's say, but very rare


[17-Nov-20 09:11 PM] Jcharming#2693
Interestingly enough this was a 2nd time opening on this machine, and the first time it was opened it went through just fine.  

Closed and opened again and it's stuck on a loop. 
Downloaded older version (halloween version of 030) same situation first time opened it goes through, and second time it's locked into loop.

May you try (if you have a github account https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/suites/1518098084/artifacts/26744432) `atomicdex-desktop-installer-windows-10-qt-5-15-0-1d18024.exe`

It's our new installer for windows user maybe this will work for you ?


[17-Nov-20 09:15 PM] Slyris#2880
The difference between the normal bundle it's that the admin rights are required to run the application (since it's installed in ProgramFiles) - maybe this will change the problem

Hi I updated to latest version of Atomicdex-decktop but I get this message and can't login to my wallet.  Mismatch at R2R custom asset configuration. Application needs to be restarted for R@R custom asset.  But I get the same when I restart. It was working fine with R2R custom asset before update.

You can reset your cfg @Roger in the settings

And then add your coin again

The reason why it didn't work for you is that you probably had to add your custom coin before we added the feature that allows you to reconfigure

Just compare the Marmara repo with the komodo repo on github. The only changes so far are `option(DISABLE_GEOBLOCKING "Enable to disable geoblocking (for dev purpose)" ON)` instead of `OFF` when compiling. So it's still the same netid/orderbooks for now.

Some people might see KYC functionality as a bad thing, but it is also a requirement for any trust based system with communities. Anyway.. 

I want to start a brainstorming issue. But I need to tell about problem area first and then opportunities.

As you know, Credit loops on Marmara are planned to work in 2 different protocols. The credits in Protocol 1 are fully collateralized and works very well for nearly one year. We are thankful to @jl777c, @dimxy and great team of Komodo to help us realize this to happen. 

For protocol 2, the credits will be under collateralized and even zero collateralized until maturity date. Protocol 2 credits are planned to work same as post-dated cheques which are simply money creation by people. But they need cheque books to be given by banks otherwise can only use simple promissory notes. Since cheque books are used to create money, banks do not give those to everyone and each slip in a cheque book means a blockage amount worth of nearly 400 USD.


[24-Nov-20 10:05 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Actually protocol 2 credits are money creation similar to banking credits. However bank credits bear interest and cannot be endorsed by people and transferred to others as in post-dated cheques by people where they simply create any amount of money, in any currency by issuing with a future date on the cheque. Since banks cannot redeem until maturity date, those cheques are just endorsed and transferred to other people for an exchange of goods and services. They simply work as analog blockchain but based on TRUST. The best thing about those instruments is that they ONLY work within real economy.

To make it short. We are preparing ourselves for protocol 2 now and we need escrows to help solve non-redemption problem during settlement most of which will be manual or semi-automated. We need escrows/communities having crypto exchange functionalities embedded with credit loop approvals according to protocol 2.

Those escrows are required to setup investment pools and have some collateralization to become escrows on Marmara blockchain. Issuance of a credit under Protocol 2 will be done by approval of escrow and all needed procedures such as the manual work of collateralizations over physical assets from issuer, KYC, Manuel settlements and dispute resolution are left to escrow which later get rewards from Marmara blockchain similar to Komodo notarization system with enhanced functionalities during credit approval and settlement. 

We are honored to host non-KYC version of AtomicDEX. If possible, we also need a a trust based Version of AtomicDEX with embedded functionalities for approval of credits by escrow points which will make accomplish required procedures around the communities. I check in the market now there are some projects claiming to setup a crypto exchange easily within hours. There are also some open source crypto exchange projects.


[24-Nov-20 10:05 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
I feel that that kind of AtomicDEX version might have flexibility to be adopted by any community. Now we want to setup those escrows for protocol 2 in at least 80 different locations each in a different city. I have consulted @ca333 about the issue and I am happy that he has a positive answer. Can we have such alternative? We have counted the number of crypto exchanges now in Turkey alone and found out that there are more than a dozen and I know many startup which like to establish a crypto exchange. I think AtomicDEX can be a good alternative for this purpose.

Thanks for ping, will reply shortly.
> I noticed atomicdex stores some data in the opreturn mainly for alice but sometimes also for bob does somebody know where that value is set in the code?
The swap secret hash was added to additional OP_RETURN output of swap payment to avoid some rare but possible cases when secret hash can be lost on both nodes database. Which in turn means that output becomes unspendable because secret hash is also hashed into P2SH and the value can be guessed only.
The change was done in May 2020 (<https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/639>), but I guess there can be few outdated nodes still which do not add the OP_RETURN output.

USDT doesn't implement ERC20 standard correctly. so, it isn't supported. the other stable coins we support are: busd,tusd,usdc


[03-Dec-20 12:50 AM] CiPhEr#2091
oh ok. yeah i'm looking at getting into a usd stablecoin to lock in some profits, preferably one that would work with atomicdex. I've done a little bit of reading in here about how usdt's contract can change, even in some instances locking out the owner from using it, which would be terrifying.


[03-Dec-20 12:50 AM] CiPhEr#2091
do busd,tusd and usdc have those same problems or just usdt mainly?


[03-Dec-20 12:54 AM] gcharang#6833
> about how usdt's contract can change, even in some instances locking out the owner from using it, which would be terrifying
yeah, thats just one of the potential issues with usdt. not sure if the other stable coins have similar issues, but the ones I have mentioned are present in the coins file (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KomodoPlatform/coins/master/coins) so I know they have been tested and work with atomicDEX

[06-Dec-20 08:00 PM] lightspeed393#5403
do you have any antivirus that's blocking mm2?


[06-Dec-20 08:02 PM] Johnny B.#9425
my antivirus isnt saying anything


[06-Dec-20 08:02 PM] Johnny B.#9425
Ill try turning it off


[06-Dec-20 08:03 PM] Johnny B.#9425
with antivirus off, it gets just past MM2, then crashes

For information: `Israel, Iran, Canada, USA, South Sudan, Hong Kong and Singapore` are still Geoblocked for AML/Compliance, if you are in those countries and still want to use the last atomicdex version / participate to the stress test please consider:

- Using geo free version from Marmara @B. G√ºltekin √áetiner (They didn't update to the last atomicdex version yet)
- Using a `VPN`
- Build the application yourself with DISABLE_GEOBLOCKING option in the CMakeLists.txt to `ON` (https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/blob/dev/CMakeLists.txt#L40)

i noticed there is no usdc pairs on oracle earth right now, is it not being offered on atomicdex anymore or does it just happen to be no orders currently?


[07-Dec-20 01:20 AM] Slyris#2880
I didn't understand the question


[07-Dec-20 05:32 AM] cipi#4502
@CiPhEr maker nodes switched to mm2.1 on netid 7777, like the newly released AtomicDEX Desktop
all sites that show orderbooks need to switch to mm2.1 too

@cipi how did you manage to compile it?


[07-Dec-20 08:33 AM] cipi#4502
you need `nightly-2020-10-25`
and if you use `cargo build --features native --release` to build (with --release), it will do a non-debug build


[07-Dec-20 08:33 AM] CHMEX#0686
Thanks!


[07-Dec-20 08:33 AM] CHMEX#0686
Will try


[07-Dec-20 08:34 AM] lightspeed393#5403
thanks cipi, I was in the middle of building with `nightly-2020-02-01`  guess I should cancel and restart


[07-Dec-20 08:35 AM] lightspeed393#5403
The github readme should be updated


[07-Dec-20 08:36 AM] cipi#4502
build likely fail with the older nightly


[07-Dec-20 08:36 AM] lightspeed393#5403
yup


[07-Dec-20 08:38 AM] CHMEX#0686
Seednodes are the same just netid is 7777 correct?


[07-Dec-20 08:44 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, just change the netid


[07-Dec-20 08:58 AM] cipi#4502
i started without specifying seed nodes for netid 7777, it works fine
IPs of newly added seednodes to 7777 are distributed to clients


[08-Dec-20 06:33 AM] uak#6718
Does the desktop version have CLI? can I pass wallet name or proxy server when I start it?


[08-Dec-20 06:40 AM] Slyris#2880
Can you be more specific @uak


[08-Dec-20 06:40 AM] Slyris#2880
What do you mean CLI ? Usable in terminal ?


[08-Dec-20 06:40 AM] uak#6718
Yes


[08-Dec-20 06:40 AM] Slyris#2880
This is basically mm2 !


[08-Dec-20 06:41 AM] Slyris#2880
Btw not in our roadmap but a system with ncurses instead of Qt is definitely possible


[08-Dec-20 06:41 AM] Slyris#2880
Would be an interesting bounty


[08-Dec-20 06:42 AM] uak#6718
I mean something like `./atomicdex-desktop-0.3.1-beta-linux.AppImage --proxy-server="socks5://foobar:1080"`


[08-Dec-20 06:42 AM] uak#6718
or 
`./atomicdex-desktop-0.3.1-beta-linux.AppImage --wallet something`


[08-Dec-20 06:43 AM] uak#6718
I tried to run it with --help but nothing shows


[08-Dec-20 06:44 AM] uak#6718
just running the desktop dex with some command line arguments


[08-Dec-20 06:46 AM] Slyris#2880
This is not possible at the moment


[08-Dec-20 06:46 AM] Slyris#2880
Not sure if it's really useful too, can you give some details about the use case ?


[08-Dec-20 06:48 AM] uak#6718
Many apps uses this, for example firefox allows you to chose the user profile from command line or data folder


[08-Dec-20 06:48 AM] uak#6718
You can select proxy settings using command line


[08-Dec-20 06:48 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah but we have a selection menu in the UI to pick the wallet


[08-Dec-20 06:49 AM] Slyris#2880
Regarding the proxy, is it for mm2 ?


[08-Dec-20 06:49 AM] uak#6718
no just for using the wallet


[08-Dec-20 06:50 AM] Slyris#2880
Well what I can tell right now is, if you want a nice CLI interface would be something with ncurses likely with nice menu and options, but this is definitely not planned, maybe as a community contribution


[08-Dec-20 06:51 AM] uak#6718
no that is not necessary.  Was only hoping to have a way to feed some arguments to the desktop wallet before run it. so it could be run with different data folder or different internet connection


[08-Dec-20 07:44 AM] Regnar#6164
Is there a way to list a custom asset that isn't listed on Coinpaprika?

I just noticed this as a potential bottle neck, if we want to support a new ERC20/QRC20 token, a user cannot add it to AtomicDEX unless it is already on Coinpaprika, however Coinpaprika does not let you add coins/tokens to their site that are not already on an exchange (with an API url to point at).

So non-listed, new coins, who expect easy access/listings to AtomicDEX cannot do this unless they are already on another exchange..


[08-Dec-20 07:46 AM] Regnar#6164
This could be resolved by having a skip button for the Coinpaprika section, which zeros out "prices" and requires them to be "found". However, maintaining this price history could be tricky.


[08-Dec-20 07:46 AM] lightspeed393#5403
If you add a coin/token by adding it to the codebase and not just the custom method, you can specify TESTCOIN and not have coinpaprika data.


[08-Dec-20 07:48 AM] Regnar#6164
thanks for the response lightspeed, I'm not too familiar with AtomicDEX codebase, or non GUI usage.

all of the supernet assets are listed with test-coin


[08-Dec-20 07:49 AM] Regnar#6164
okay, so you can just use `test-coin` via the GUI

@cipi Hello, I have a feature request for the next time if there is an update....Can it be less intrusive? Because I didn't have any option to cancel the update and as you know our coin isn't listed until next year so we are kind of depending on a custom build.

I also agree it was a bit much. I don't think I could even access the wallet functions.


[08-Dec-20 01:12 PM] Slyris#2880
For security reasons we have to review additional coin.


[08-Dec-20 01:12 PM] Sudoba#9452
@Regnar this is only if you have an existing AtomicDEX wallet, you have to find the hidden folder named .atomic_qt in your home directory. Next step would be to adjust the coins.json and the 0.3.1-coins.walletname.json


[08-Dec-20 01:22 PM] Sudoba#9452
@Slyris I get that but .. the update method shouldn't be so intrusive so users can always have a choice. Just my 2 satoshi


[08-Dec-20 01:25 PM] Regnar#6164
Oh my intentions was to add GETH to every wallet as a default coin to choose, as a form of potential marketing plan that I brought up in the marketing channel.

@lightspeed393 I believe it's something like 7.77


[11-Dec-20 09:20 AM] lightspeed393#5403
I tested today and got the 7.77 transaction for both RICK and MORTY, but RICK faucet sent 4 of the 7.77 txs and MORTY sent 8 of the 7.77 txs. Wasn't sure if that's expected behavior or not. Wanted to share in case it's a bug. We don't want the faucet getting overloaded from this when the stress test starts.

yes, I see it has the countdown timer for 7:30AM UTC, but the twitter post said the stress test was for 48 hours


[11-Dec-20 12:44 PM] Johnny B.#9425
so it goes to 7:30AM UTC monday?

it's a feature, i was asked to lift all limitations during last stress test

if virus checker already removed mm2.exe, you likely need to reinstall
you can check if it's there, maybe it's another problem


[11-Dec-20 06:11 PM] Paro#7842
mm2.exe is in place.


[11-Dec-20 06:12 PM] Paro#7842
I guess that's a problem with the default browser.


[11-Dec-20 06:13 PM] Paro#7842
"mm2.exe" Doesn't it have to be here? "C:\Program Files\AtomicDEX Desktop\assets\tools\mm2" ?


[11-Dec-20 06:15 PM] cipi#4502
my `assets/tools/mm2/` under linux contains 2 files, mm2 (the executable) and coins
mm2 is likely called mm2.exe under windows

it also says `Retrieving Wallet information of C:\Users\Yusuf KO√á\AppData\Roaming\atomic_qt\config\0.3.1-coins.YusufKOC.json`, so it is looking int he correct location... i don't know what the problem is, @Slyris may be able to help

yes, YusufKOC.json is in the right position.
but there is no location called "D:/a/atomicDEX-Desktop/"....

maybe it does not like special chars in usernames/directories, like `√á`, but that is something only the devs can tell us

you can try to use any of these nameservers instead

Any tricks for getting past ‚Äúinitializing MM2‚Äù on Mac Desktop. It‚Äôs been an hour....

Probably connection problem


[12-Dec-20 07:44 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Try turning off firewall


[12-Dec-20 07:45 AM] DeMarco#5676
Huh. Ok. Will do


[12-Dec-20 07:48 AM] DeMarco#5676
Still spinning. Didn‚Äôt seem to make difference w or w/o firewall. 

There were two options for release download for Mac - do you know difference...m1 vs other?


[12-Dec-20 07:51 AM] gcharang#6833
m1 is for the new macbooks with apple cpus


[12-Dec-20 07:51 AM] gcharang#6833
if you have the older version with intel cpus you shouldn't use it

"seed words" are set of secret words you need to backup. these are used to generate your address and can also be used to restore the same wallet on a different device. you shouldn't share them with anyone else

exact price depends on the coin type, compatibilitty , custom work needed by us etc., but it should be between $5k to $10k

A couple things to note that may be helpful to devs:
1) Apparently fully-filled orders seem to always and consistently leave dust in wallet. I got dust for all of those weird coins that showed up over the weekend (MCL, ZILLA, etc) even after selling them back, as well for my filled and completed QTUM and EMC2 orders.
2) Some (matched) orders seem to take fees but never go through, they don't even get completed or say anything after munching on them for hours. This has happened to me 4 or 5 times in the RVN-KMD pair.


[14-Dec-20 03:27 AM] Raccoon#4621
I also have a ZILLA order that's been stuck on refunding since yesterday lol.


[14-Dec-20 03:44 AM] Raccoon#4621
Update: Zilla order refunding disappeared so either it got refunded or just poof. I have no idea as I wasn't tracking balances.

I'm sure @smkhound have tested dust really well for 0.3.1


[14-Dec-20 03:45 AM] smkhound#7640
Thanks for feedback. 
1 - coins with dynamic fees can be difficult to properly estimate what they will be, I've seen this and we are investigating options to resolve. This is never a problem with Antara Smartchains.
2 - Unfortunately due to the multi tx process of an atomic swap, if it fails part way thru, fees for the transactions of earlier steps have been spent.
3 - ZILLA is an on demand chain, so waiting for confirmations while no other transactions are pending on chain can result in a stalled swap. There is a couple of things you can do to get past this, first is to reduce the number of confirmations needed, second is to create another transaction as the swap is ongoing (e.g. send funds to self). Devs of on demand chains could / should be running a tx generator that detects atomic swap transactions that automatically generate transactions to move the chain along until complete. I've investigated this issue with KOIN (another on demand chain) and am working on a proof of concept to test a fix


[14-Dec-20 03:45 AM] Slyris#2880
Look at the logs you will see which endpoint failed


[14-Dec-20 03:46 AM] smkhound#7640
pls DM your address, I can check to see if ZILLA refund was auto processed


[14-Dec-20 03:46 AM] Slyris#2880
Do you mind using a dev version @Tom.T ?

I have improved timeout to 60 seconds instead of 5 seconds

@smkhound what is the process of checking if refund was auto processed?


[14-Dec-20 04:39 AM] smkhound#7640
basically I check block explorers for related transactions of same value for related addresses on involved coins (linked by b-address)


[14-Dec-20 04:40 AM] smkhound#7640
refund should show funds sent to b-address returning them to original address


[14-Dec-20 04:41 AM] smkhound#7640
if funds still in b-address, it is stuck, but refund button should process it


[14-Dec-20 04:43 AM] smkhound#7640
still investigating how on demand chains might have extra challenges and how to resolve that efficiently

@Bucktooth Hey ! It's possible that the other part is disconnected... that's why it takes so long probably


[15-Dec-20 01:54 AM] Bucktooth#1834
Hm...welp AtomicDex has taken all my coins tho, and the transaction can't be cancelled, so ig I can only wait and hope for the best?


[15-Dec-20 01:55 AM] Slyris#2880
@Bucktooth In case of failure you will be refunded


[15-Dec-20 01:56 AM] Bucktooth#1834
Could you please elaborate on what does "failure" mean?


[15-Dec-20 01:56 AM] Bucktooth#1834
Like when does it timeout?


[15-Dec-20 01:56 AM] Slyris#2880
When your swap status will became "Failed"


[15-Dec-20 01:57 AM] Slyris#2880
You will be able to see it in the swaps history

[15-Dec-20 01:57 AM] Slyris#2880
but @cipi can probably tell you more


[15-Dec-20 01:57 AM] Bucktooth#1834
kk


[15-Dec-20 01:57 AM] Bucktooth#1834
Thanks


[15-Dec-20 01:57 AM] Bucktooth#1834
Wl wait for another hour then


[15-Dec-20 01:58 AM] Slyris#2880
np !


[15-Dec-20 02:00 AM] Bucktooth#1834
Also, does it matter if I close the application during a swap and/or waiting for order to be matched with that of another person/buyer?


[15-Dec-20 02:02 AM] Slyris#2880
Yes you should stay online during an entire swap


[15-Dec-20 02:02 AM] Bucktooth#1834
And while waiting for order to be matched with that of another person/buyer?


[15-Dec-20 02:02 AM] Slyris#2880
If your order is not matched you can quit the app


[15-Dec-20 02:02 AM] Slyris#2880
But to be able to be matched you need to be online too


[15-Dec-20 02:02 AM] Bucktooth#1834
Oh ok


[15-Dec-20 02:03 AM] Bucktooth#1834
Thx

[15-Dec-20 03:53 AM] Bucktooth#1834

[15-Dec-20 03:53 AM] Bucktooth#1834
5:08:49 elapsed


[15-Dec-20 05:59 AM] cipi#4502
trading partner likely dropped out (shut down, network lost, whatever)... swap will fail and be refunded if funds were sent
i don't know/forgot how the formula for the timeout is... if i remember right it depends on the involved chains and the confirmation settings of the swap @artem.pikulin knows it for sure
the reason for swap failure (both from maker and taker) can be seen under https://dexapi.cipig.net/public/error.php?uuid=xxxxxxx (replace xxxxxx with the swap uuid) later, after swap finished (not while waiting for timeout)


[15-Dec-20 06:25 AM] cipi#4502
the error on my side says `lp_swap:215] Timeout (18811 > 18810)` ... and 18810 / 60 / 60 = 5.225 hours ... which corresponds to the 5h 17m from TakerPaymentValidateFailed (i was maker waiting for taker to pay TakerPayment)

when installing v3.1 desktop on a mac should i be using osx or osx-m1


[15-Dec-20 08:08 AM] ezeman#2102
or what is the difference


[15-Dec-20 08:15 AM] gcharang#6833
m1 is for the new m1 mac laptops. if you didn't purchase recently, you should use the osx one

@Slyris Do you have an idea how other people can know that you have added one specific erc20 token via add custom asset?


[16-Dec-20 07:15 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah @CHMEX at the last step if the config is emtpy this means it's already added


[16-Dec-20 07:15 AM] Slyris#2880
and in the cfg it's have the field `is_custom`


[16-Dec-20 07:15 AM] CHMEX#0686
hmm lets say I add: 0x0000000000b3f879cb30fe243b4dfee438691c04 ( gastoken) how do other people know I'm ready to trade

custom tokens have `-ERC` `-QRC` prefix too, i think for 0.3.1 it's only for QRC, but will be added for ERC as well (note this is only for custom tokens, and this also check if the coins is already present or not.

Hi folks! When recovering wallet what fields (besides seed) we should fill?

AtomicDex 0.31 on Win 10, I am seeing an error on startup: qt5core.dll not found (" The program can't start because qt5core.dll is missing from your computer. try reinstalling the program to fix this problem.")


[16-Dec-20 08:40 AM] jansako#3330
Closing the error still allows DEX to start & the swaps work as expected. Only issues I see is that the swap history does not update (new swaps do not make it there after a date rolls over) and every once in a while the price updates stop displaying. Orders still get filled though so it seems to be a UI issue, not MM2.


[16-Dec-20 09:00 AM] Slyris#2880
All !


[16-Dec-20 09:35 AM] KhasanovIB#7363
But when recovering we don't remember password?


[16-Dec-20 09:41 AM] cipi#4502
you need old seed and new password... that's the reason you have to confirm the password... so you can use a new one

{Reactions}
üëç 

[16-Dec-20 11:55 AM] |o0l0o|#7266
is the password field required when recovering? can it be blank? @Team-Supporter


[16-Dec-20 02:48 PM] Slyris#2880
No it cannot be blank - it's the password to login to your wallet !


[16-Dec-20 09:37 PM] gcharang#6833
it can be any password. not necessarily your old one!


[16-Dec-20 11:33 PM] |o0l0o|#7266
can it be blank?


[16-Dec-20 11:34 PM] gcharang#6833
no, the password is used to encrypt the seed words when they are stored on your computer


[16-Dec-20 11:36 PM] |o0l0o|#7266
ok, thanks

Hi guys as most of you don't know that I used to write content with @mylo_SH on
Ikomodo.com

And we are doing it again this time centric around komodo and it's ecosystem. My goal is to explain komodo to newbies in leyman's terms. I have wrote this simple article working on more including 

What are atomic swaps and how do they work

Atomic dex mobile
Making orders
Filling orders  and how they work

Verus and it's ecosystem
Marmara credit loops

Please support

Here is a simple article on atomicdex desktop if you can take some time to add comments, more headings I can cover. 

I will really appreciate that

The content will go live from january. We are building a different site for komodo news and updates around it's ecosystem

[18-Dec-20 11:01 AM] Johnny B.#9425
I cannot get an order to match, I dont understand


[18-Dec-20 11:20 AM] cipi#4502
which pair?


[18-Dec-20 11:48 AM] Johnny B.#9425
KMD/DOGE


[18-Dec-20 02:30 PM] cipi#4502
if taker coin is KMD it should work... maybe price changed in the meantime
if taker coin is DOGE, you need to sell DOGE that is at least 5 KMD worth... i have set min_volume, so that sells of DOGE < 777 are not matched... those swaps would fail anyway at TakerFeeSend


[18-Dec-20 03:12 PM] Mogrith#0013
If the BTC rise keeps up will the .077BTC min be lowered?


[18-Dec-20 04:03 PM] cipi#4502
min_volume can be set for each order individually since mm2.1: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/473#issuecomment-709281914
not added to the GUIs yet though... and atm i can't set it lower than 0.00777, but i guess this will change
the actual problem is the txfee on BTC chain though, that will stay till fixed by BTC devs
this was MakerPayment from a swap today: https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/transaction/a8d10123071b6c17dcee6bc48c43db4672c50b52c6ae2cfabae8b5b1c1988ad9
txfee 20.57 USD... 0.00777 BTC are currently ~ 180 USD... the fee is almost 10% of the swapped value... would need to set the spread at +10% to have a chance of being profitable
so long story short, i would recommend to use LTC, BCH, KMD, DASH or something else instead of BTC

Hey guys, which Desktop version should I pick? I see two links in the pin msg, but do not understand the difference

Thanks for help in advance

latest build is 3.1?


[20-Dec-20 01:16 PM] BoBot-LunaMaxi#8821
for desktop?


[20-Dec-20 02:16 PM] Cryptoon#3362
3.3 i think


[20-Dec-20 04:52 PM] BoBot-LunaMaxi#8821
I wonder why they don't have the auto update inside the app anymore


[20-Dec-20 08:28 PM] Slyris#2880
We have auto update.


[20-Dec-20 08:29 PM] Slyris#2880
This is still 0.3.1 and this information can be confirmed only with people that have Komodo Team in their tag.


[20-Dec-20 11:50 PM] JCDenton#9728
The new version 4.0 will release this year correct?


[21-Dec-20 02:44 AM] Slyris#2880
@JCDenton most of the dextop team are in Holliday's right now, 0.4.0 will probably be for Q1 2021


[21-Dec-20 03:05 AM] JCDenton#9728
@Slyris thank you...so 04.0 will be posponed

I'm not sure if you've already got one setup, and if not what I'm to do to get that working exactly. Do you have any tutorials on the process?

[23-Dec-20 02:38 AM] cipi#4502
@Zanzarismo sorry, i have no idea about Windows, but i don't think it will work
the requirements depend on the chain, the more blocks it has, the more RAM will be used
look what komodod for DP is using and multiply by 2

@allofandrew You use the zip version or the appimage ?

@cipi It's alright, thanks anyhow. I'm running everything I got on two personal laptops, I don't have a server room or warehouse of mining rigs... @ca333 Do you think it'd be possible that DigitalPrice run on the servers already setup by Komodo team? I'd really like to get this thing trading live ASAP, but I'm having to make compromises in my everyday to do so

[24-Dec-20 12:17 AM] dhdhfhfhfnf#2207
Has Komodo considered creating a multi currency hardware wallet? Magnum seems to be closing and most hardware wallets seem to find it challenging to stay up to date with new coins.


[24-Dec-20 12:17 AM] dhdhfhfhfnf#2207
Having atomicdex built into a great hardware wallet might be a way to encourage adoption of the dex.


[24-Dec-20 04:48 AM] Raccoon#4621
There seems to be a persistent set of problems with RVN. During and after the stress test, tried to swap it to other coins (KMD, LTC..) and every single time it failed, taking fees and not returning them. Trying to withdraw it gives an error on mobile wallet and on the desktop one it just stays preparing forever until I close the window.


[24-Dec-20 05:27 AM] smkhound#7640
Heya @Raccoon pls send logs in DM and I'll see if I can replicate or find source of problem


[24-Dec-20 05:45 AM] Raccoon#4621
The withdrawals just fail and don't generate logs. The others I sent you some examples before. Since it happens only with this currency (out of the ones I used) might be a bigger problem?


[24-Dec-20 06:27 AM] smkhound#7640
I know in the past RVN fees were increased which led to problems, but not sure yet what issue is this time.


[24-Dec-20 07:12 AM] Raccoon#4621
all fixed thanks to @smkhound's dilligence and availability. thank you very much!

how complicated is it to add XRP?


[26-Dec-20 03:06 AM] BoBot-LunaMaxi#8821
how much we talking to get it on to the dex?


[26-Dec-20 03:08 AM] BoBot-LunaMaxi#8821
if it's possible, we can ask XRP army/community for donations to make it happen ....


[26-Dec-20 04:29 AM] gcharang#6833
xrp is a database with no provable public nodes. xrp transactions can be frozen/denied if the ripple company wants to afaik. so, the xrp coins are inherently incompatible with atomic swaps

Ok thanks for the reply @gcharang

The truth is that there is no error as such, or at least I do not see it, but I am attaching what I have, the fact is that 550 approx DOGE sent from the atomic dex wallet do not reach the exchange.

@fdeflash I believe DOGE has a min. Fee of 1 DOGE to process the transaction your fee is set to 0.94 DOGE which might mean why it's not confirmed. @Slyris maybe adex should give a warning I'm sure the min fe eis somehow known to adex from the config file?

you have theoretically unlimited number of pairs possible. adding them all would mean adding all possible orderbooks, which would be a lot and that wouldnt provide a very good overview

lets say you have 4 coins, you can have 12 possible combinations of order books, if you have 100 coins, you have 100x99 combos

Normally you can add the pairs you want to see once, and they will show up on startup every time after that though!

Question, I see that the same order of 22078 KMD is placed on different order books. Is that done using the multi-order feature? If so, what would happen if new market orders for an amount greater than those funds were placed simultaneously?


[29-Dec-20 09:56 AM] Regnar#6164
> Is that done using the multi-order feature?
Yes

Normally one order getting executed would clear the other orders from the books.

If they all occurred simultaneously it would execute whichever one "clears" first. Since Atomic Swaps are "atomic" they either happen or they don't. The slower trade/coin/confirmations would get stuck in a hash timelocked address waiting for the main payment to be traded, but since this actually went to someone else it would never arrive and the waiting funds would be returned after about 4 hours.

So is AtomicDEX downloads geoblocked, or is just the exchange function blocked?

4 failed swaps for LTC DGB after I paid .15cents each swap


[30-Dec-20 07:30 PM] BoBot-LunaMaxi#8821
is it possible that the maker payment confirms faster than the taker fee therefore the swap keeps failing?


[30-Dec-20 07:35 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Are you using max amount, I know that sometimes fails  using that and just need to  put a slightly smaller amount

Just used AtomicDex Desktop for first time today, looks truly great. Worked right out of the gate. Really diggin it so far. I mainly use mm2 CLI and Mobile, so its quite sight for the eyes.


[31-Dec-20 02:31 PM] tolken#2655
Still would like to see some ‚Äòdefault‚Äô markets rather than having to pick BASE/REL pairs manually. Having default pairs (KMD designated as default REL for many) would feel much more inviting and CEX like. Manually selecting them is more of a power-user feature IMHO.


[31-Dec-20 02:33 PM] tolken#2655
Human perception of inverted prices is tricky. The less arbitrary pairs there are, the more consistent the prices will appear to users, less disorienting it will be.


[31-Dec-20 02:34 PM] tolken#2655
Default markets being listed based on things like historical activity, volume, trade frequency etc.


[31-Dec-20 07:09 PM] smkhound#7640
Perhaps a "favourite markets" thing like bookmarks would be a nice enhancement


[31-Dec-20 09:04 PM] tolken#2655
Yes, that would be good, but I still think guiding users toward consistent default pairs would go a long way toward reducing the friction toward making a first trade.

Ever since the last update to MacOS Desktop (prior to stress test) Any time I load it, I get stuck at ‚Äúinitializing MM2‚Äù
I‚Äôve turned off firewalls, antivirus. One thing I did discover is in ‚Äúadvanced firewall setting‚Äù AtomicDEX does not show as an application that I can ‚Äúallow/block‚Äù incoming connections. While all the other applications do: Verus desktop, agama, google etc. Does the ‚ÄúAtomicDEX installer/maintenance‚Äù have something to do with that? The update just previous to the last and every other seemed to work fine. iOS works great and is how I have been doing swaps since 12/12-13. Just some random feedback that maybe makes more sense to you than me....

@@lightspeed393 well done , very nice guide! I liked the geo-block tip for using it as dex even in the "forbidden" countries .

Just one question please : Are all the hosted coins available for reading in pairs with each other ?
I mean for example Zec / DGB ? 
ZER/Zec , doge / DGB , Doge/ Zcoin ?
Or you have to use always btc pr ltc or some specific coins as intermediate ?


[06-Jan-21 05:28 PM] lightspeed393#5403

[06-Jan-21 07:44 PM] Mogrith#0013

It sounds logical. It may seem "somehow slow" to achieve your desired transaction but we should not forget that more and more people will be turning to DEXs everyday from now on.


[07-Jan-21 02:07 AM] VandarGR#6065
Too many hacks to the centralized exchanges recently. And especially for the privacy coins the systemic pressure will be supreme.


[07-Jan-21 02:07 AM] VandarGR#6065
So a DEX will be a one-way solution.


[07-Jan-21 02:09 AM] VandarGR#6065
IMHO ,the komodo team should be concentrated to the privacy coins with unique blockchains for the atomicdex.

The Ethereum tokens have already a wide variety of swapping options un many DEX exchanges.
Monero, Bitcoinz, SAFECOIN etc don't.

[07-Jan-21 08:56 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, we don't concentrate on ETH or ERC20 trading, it's just one of the supported assets and it's just works for any compatible token. You already can swap dozens of unique blockchain coins, some of them got privacy features. And as lightspeed highlighted above - any supported coin/token can be traded for any supported coin/token so there are thousands of potential market pairs already

Is the default procedure for new coins/communities that want to be listed to email partners@komodoplatform.com? I always see that as the response, but are people aware that it's possible to submit Pull Requests themselves?


[07-Jan-21 09:47 AM] lightspeed393#5403
For example BITCOINZ devs could follow the instuctions in the `coins` repo and submit a PR themselves without bothering the team to do it, if they're that desperate for a DEX and haven't gotten a response @VandarGR.


[07-Jan-21 09:48 AM] lightspeed393#5403
Things get done a lot faster when people take care of things themselves and not wait for the team to accomplish everything. Their list is long enough. Unless that's what the team wants.

Given the existence of other means like Pirate, it is not actively being pursued, but it is not worthless. See https://discord.com/channels/412898016371015680/455851625915875338/766601249775681537


[08-Jan-21 07:12 PM] smkhound#7640
coin options should reappear on restart. A coin that was not enabled can't be disabled, so if enabling fails...
Worst case scenario you can clear the enabled coins userdata file to start with a blank slate if you run into failed enablings on start. I got stuck in a similar loop yesterday and that fixed it for me.

At what point in an atomicdex transaction should I assume the trade has failed? Currently sitting on "maker payment validated and confirmed" for 18 minutes.


[09-Jan-21 08:17 PM] smkhound#7640
depends on pair and how fast the blocks flow


[09-Jan-21 08:18 PM] smkhound#7640
e.g. btc trades take longer because of 10 min blockimes

for the second time today i notice the komodo price in the GUI is way off... since each time i check paprika and gecko are right (and the GUI only lists paprika and bandprotocol) i'm assuming bandprotocol is off.


[11-Jan-21 03:52 PM] 0x03#8822
before KMD was about half in price, a slight bit below verus (which was why i noticed)


[11-Jan-21 03:53 PM] 0x03#8822
currently 6-ish  euro-cent, 39.6 -> 46.3

i saw it correcting for the first time at :13 this hour


[11-Jan-21 07:50 PM] Slyris#2880
You should not assume that bandprotocol is off by default, by clicking on the band icon you will be able to click on the last band request and verify the quality of the oracle price feed yourself


[11-Jan-21 07:51 PM] Slyris#2880
Note that if the difference of timestamp since the last request is too large you are right - we switch to paprika

Installing AtomicDEX Software (MM2)
::: warning Note
If you would prefer to avoid building MM2 from source, you can download our pre-built binary from our Github releases page.

I downloaded Git Bash, Cmake, rust, jq, Cmake, and visual studio to get this in operative order... But I'm still stuck at step three of this process... Genie was very kind and made me this list, but I'm still unsure on some of it
1) clone https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop tohttps://github.com/DigitalPrice/atomicDEX-Desktop
2) download to your computer by https://github.com/DigitalPrice/atomicDEX-Desktop.git -b dev

3) edit assets/config/0.3.0-coins.json and atomic_defi_design/qml/Constants/Style.qml to add DP
4) add a png (like the one I posted) as atomic_defi_design/assets/images/coins/dp.png
5) edit qml.qrc to indicate the png
6) push changes from your computer to https://github.com/DigitalPrice/atomicDEX-Desktop

7) on the webpage for https://github.com/DigitalPrice/atomicDEX-Desktop, it will say like This branch is 2 commits ahead of KomodoPlatform:dev, to the right of that click  Pull request 
8) on the new page click Create pull request
9)  on the new page add title (something like add DP) then click Create pull request

[11-Jan-21 10:37 PM] Slyris#2880
You have to wait new instructions, you cannot add a new coin right now


[11-Jan-21 10:40 PM] Zanzarismo#6500
Oh, alright. Thanks for the update. I was told that DigitalPrice would be grandfathered into the dex, but I've been struggling for weeks to figure out how to do so myself...

So the 0.4.0 release is the first official release...opened for all?


[11-Jan-21 11:28 PM] CHMEX#0686
Does that change allow to add coins on the fly without restarting the mm2? Specially erc20 tokens would be good to add on the fly


[11-Jan-21 11:39 PM] Slyris#2880
Honestly I listed more than 150 erc20 in 0.4.0 and yes custom coins addition will still be here


[11-Jan-21 11:41 PM] CHMEX#0686
Did you swap an erc20 with eth lately? My node had an error on link eth tonyl has the log


[11-Jan-21 11:42 PM] CHMEX#0686
What about adding realtime? Like uniswap? Without restarting the app / mm2


[11-Jan-21 11:43 PM] Slyris#2880
This is not possible, the coins cfg is parsed on start by mm2


[11-Jan-21 11:43 PM] Slyris#2880
Honestly it's not a problem to restart the app


[11-Jan-21 11:43 PM] CHMEX#0686
Its a problem for marketmakers to be honest


[11-Jan-21 11:45 PM] CHMEX#0686
If you can add it in realtime you dont have downtime on your node if you have a node doing lots of trades you cant restart without beeing punished by the network or stop serving your ongoing trades


[11-Jan-21 11:46 PM] CHMEX#0686
Sure doesnt matter if we stay at 40 trades a day but i wish to make 100000 a day if possible

@cipi  would love to hear your input


[11-Jan-21 11:49 PM] Slyris#2880
Yeah but this requires periodic verification of a config hash, can probably have a notification to ask user to download the last cfg and restart the app.

` you cant restart without beeing punished by the network or stop serving your ongoing trades`
Restarting mm2 does not fail ongoing swaps, also if restarting takes <2mins (and it should), seeds will still remember your maker orders.
You might miss a taker or two, yet it doesn't look like a too big downtime window.

My thinking is the more intuitive and the easier it is the more is actualy used. It looks technicly it will need a lot of rework as from what i can read from the conversation its currently pretty hardcoded (via coin file) at init time.

Question for everyone, a poll of sorts: Do you still mainly trade on Cexs, particularly coins that are on AtomicDex? If so, why and what would persuade you to trade more on AtomicDex? Finally, is controlling your keys enough of an incentive to use AtomicDex?


[17-Jan-21 05:01 PM] Dyeles#8347
There are ONLY two reasons I still use Cexs, liquidity and speed once the transaction starts. For the most part it has been 70% AtomicDex , 30% Cexs being KMD,BTC my main coins. Controlling my keys it's definitely a must, should not be an "incentive" but a default üòâ  . Now, the geographical restrictions put on AtomicDex have me wondering , yes I can circumvent them with my VPN but I'm waiting for further development on that and new versions of AtomixDex, really looking good. Cheers

[17-Jan-21 05:55 PM] tolken#2655
@Dyeles Thanks. Im curious, while i certainly can understand speed being convenient, do you think there‚Äôs a big need (for your purposes and average traders) for instant trading? As far as liquidity is concerned, how much liquidity (for KMD/BTC for example) would remedy your liquidity concern? How much liquidity is enough for the average trader? There appears to be $20k at the moment.


[17-Jan-21 07:17 PM] jspook16#3059
my friend only users Adex at the moment. KMD, BTC, VRSC, pegged USD, ETH, and several other asset chains


[17-Jan-21 07:18 PM] jspook16#3059
my friend does not mind the slow speed at the moment. If speed becomes an issues, the verus dex liquidity pools should be able to have that covered.


[17-Jan-21 07:18 PM] jspook16#3059

[17-Jan-21 07:55 PM] jspook16#3059

[17-Jan-21 10:23 PM] tolken#2655
@jspook16 thanks. Agreed, the speed is nice, but price + liquidity and reliability of trades are more important to me. Fortunately, instant trades will come back with the 0-conf eventually.


[17-Jan-21 10:51 PM] jspook16#3059
0 conf is coming back? Is that official?


[18-Jan-21 02:05 AM] tolken#2655
I‚Äôve heard devs mention it, fairly certain it‚Äôll make a comeback/on the list.


[18-Jan-21 02:07 AM] tolken#2655
Don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs anything about the new mm that would prevent it. Brilliant idea really, with the increased reliability and a good UI for it, it‚Äôll be a great feature. I think even when you held KMD, for the collateral, you‚Äôd accrue rewards still.

@Mylo thanks for the reference!


[18-Jan-21 10:48 AM] Dyeles#8347
@tolken ,  to clarify, I don't really mind the speed on a regular basis, but 95% of my crypto friends and their crypto businesses only deal on BTC and other coins, no matter how many times I have point them out to Komodo. The many times that I had bought stuff from them or transfer money, it has been using AtomixDex KMD/BTC and (for whatever reason) they  get annoyed they have to wait over 1 hour for me to go from KMD-BTC plus the time it takes from my BTC to reach them.  When it comes to liquidity, that was just to answer your question about why I still use Cex,  I only 30% of the time because some times I wanted to go from one coin to another and there has been nothing(I do have other coins but my main is KMD/BTC).  I used to have it on my phone and multiple times I could not find KMD/BTC then the app got blocked so I stopped using it.  So my concerns, suggestions, observations were based on my own specific experiences. I do agree now there is liquidity KMD/BTC and your observation that price and reliability are really important. I hope I didn't make to many English mistakes as it is not my first language. Cheers


[18-Jan-21 11:37 AM] tolken#2655
@Dyeles good points, thanks for your feedback. What pairs do you/did you find you wanted to move between most often, where you move to a CEX to do it? Besides KMD/BTC of course.


[18-Jan-21 11:39 AM] tolken#2655
@Slyris how is mintradevolume handled in AtomicDex Desktop right now, or is it not handled yet? Does it just spit out an error if the marketmaker won‚Äôt permit the trade size, or does it limit/catch it before they submit the order?


[18-Jan-21 12:54 PM] cipi#4502
https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/473#issuecomment-740379496
tried it out and the order is simply not matched when volume is not high enough to match with the maker


[18-Jan-21 02:19 PM] tolken#2655
@cipi thanks for the headsup CIPI, good to know. Hopefully they‚Äôll get that handled more elegantly down the line.

I have two failed swaps but i cant tell if the funds were recovered. The history says "funds are recoverable"


[19-Jan-21 08:04 PM] gcharang#6833
hey, please DM me the log file, I will check


[19-Jan-21 10:02 PM] jspook16#3059
I've got multiple log files. Not sure which one @gcharang


[19-Jan-21 10:32 PM] jspook16#3059
Would it be enough to check the address in the explorer to see if funds were sent out?


[19-Jan-21 11:04 PM] gcharang#6833
yes, you can check the txns on explorer to see if the coins were reclaimed by your wallet


[20-Jan-21 05:10 AM] Slyris#2880
If the swap in question has the button "Funds is recoverable" you can click on the button to recover your funds, there is somes conditions / prerequisites for a success refund, in the event logs of the message (in case of error) there is an explanation why the refund has not taken place.


[20-Jan-21 07:13 AM] jspook16#3059
I checked the explorer and I dont see the funds ever being sent out of my address. So maybe there is nothing to refund??


[20-Jan-21 07:26 AM] Slyris#2880
Did you check the error message when clicking on the refund icon?

```is it possible to integrate epic cash? Mimblewimble in rust, based off grin. Our code is 99% similar to grin and mwc and I know devs on the epic side.```

Yes I checked the error message on both. One of them says the  "No Information available about transaction" the other says "maker_swap:548] !wait for maker payment confirmations: rpc_clients:123] Waited too long until 1611041239 for transaction ..."

not possible for now. needs  research and development of another type of Atomic Swap mechanism to integrate it, grin and other grin forks

[22-Jan-21 08:36 PM] ecbuddy#8524
more liquidity would be sweet though


[22-Jan-21 08:37 PM] jspook16#3059
Yes the greatest part is that you retain control of you assets ...no third party. There are additional workshops in the making to get more liquidity.


[22-Jan-21 08:38 PM] jspook16#3059
One thing that Id really like to see is the Verus Liquidity Pools bridged to AtomicDex


[22-Jan-21 08:40 PM] jspook16#3059
Also there is a "Zero Confirmations" (also referred to as 0conf) functionality that allows you to essentially lock some KMD funds.... and then you can trade that amount with 0 confirmations making the trades really quick. This was enabled in a older version of a trade GUI called barterdex. We're suggesting adding that into AtomicDex


[22-Jan-21 08:40 PM] jspook16#3059
Theres alot of good movement happening to get it the attention it deserves


[22-Jan-21 10:36 PM] ecbuddy#8524
VRSC gonna be insane whens it ready!


[22-Jan-21 10:37 PM] ecbuddy#8524
We need that 0conf on atomicdex...as it is, tonite, none of my orders are going through on the dex. My guess is congestion of sorts? My last swap failed as well and it was 10 hrs plus waiting to finish...more liquidity and faster tx...this thing is going to be wild!


[22-Jan-21 10:47 PM] jspook16#3059
they shouldn't be failing. Try the test coins, Rick and Morty coins


[22-Jan-21 10:47 PM] jspook16#3059

Whats the best way of exporting my atomicdex ETH address and importing it into metamask? I tried importing from seed and the wrong ETH address came up on metamask


[23-Jan-21 05:35 AM] Monkins#5278
I just tried importing the seed in Verus wallet and the ETH address is the same as the Atomicdex one.. is metamask doing something silly?


[23-Jan-21 05:36 AM] CHMEX#0686
it guess it uses a different derivation path? Easiest is just to send the ETH to your metamask address

[29-Jan-21 04:55 AM] KCN#9136
I need little help


[29-Jan-21 04:56 AM] KCN#9136
please guide me how can I swap or exchange my Verus coin into LTC


[29-Jan-21 04:58 AM] SHossain#0007
there are some orders for VRSC<>LTC


[29-Jan-21 05:00 AM] SHossain#0007
- download the app
- create an account or restore with your own seedphrase (** if you create new, keep a safe backup of your seed phrase**)
- enable VRSC & LTC coins
- fund your wallet if you created new seed/address
- swap


[29-Jan-21 05:00 AM] KCN#9136
I cant share screen shot here


[29-Jan-21 05:00 AM] KCN#9136
what I need to enter in LTC price I have 20 Verus coin


[29-Jan-21 05:01 AM] KCN#9136
can I DM you ?


[29-Jan-21 05:01 AM] SHossain#0007
do you want to sell at market price or you want to set your own price?


[29-Jan-21 05:02 AM] KCN#9136
IDK what should I need to do ? can I sell on my own price ?? is that work ?


[29-Jan-21 05:03 AM] KCN#9136
I think at this time LTC is 142$ and verus is 0.29


[29-Jan-21 05:03 AM] SHossain#0007
there are orders already, if you want to sell your VRSC to those orders, just tap on them and that will fill the price for you


[29-Jan-21 05:03 AM] SHossain#0007
then, all you have to do is select how much you want to sell


[29-Jan-21 05:03 AM] SHossain#0007
and start the swap


[29-Jan-21 05:04 AM] KCN#9136

[29-Jan-21 05:12 AM] SHossain#0007
yes


[29-Jan-21 05:12 AM] KCN#9136
why there are 19.97 verus coin ? I have transfer 20 in this wallet


[29-Jan-21 05:12 AM] SHossain#0007
so, essentially, when you have VRSC on the left side and LTC on the right side on your DEX screen you will see the orderbook.
currently there are  2 buy orders on that pair
best price is 0.00185766 LTC per VRSC


[29-Jan-21 05:14 AM] SHossain#0007
you can click on that first order, that will populate the price in the right side in the SELL VRSC box, you select the VRSC volume you want to sell, click START SWAP and click CONFIRM once you are satisfied with the details that is presented to you


[29-Jan-21 05:14 AM] KCN#9136
I just click confirm

any plans to add a Matrix-like chat/troll box to the desktop app?
the dex needing to be open to make trades can make liquidity spotty, but if we have some other reasons to be on the dex too, it can help keep orderbooks open providing liquidity. I remember a few years ago hanging in the Poloniex trollbox with no intention to trade just killing time chatting, and then see an opportunity and place trades.

Hi, what is the best way to update adex desktop?


[30-Jan-21 02:50 PM] lightspeed393#5403
close the one you're using. Download the newest version. Start/install the new version.


[30-Jan-21 02:51 PM] Nora Gretz#0461
it will overwrite previous version?


[30-Jan-21 03:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yes


[30-Jan-21 03:43 PM] Cryptoon#3362

Could it be possible to add on atomic dex desktop a mining app that could be use to intuitively mine the very new chains or the chains specifically made for CPU mining (Verus have those mining algo right ?) 
Hope I make sens üëç


[31-Jan-21 02:54 AM] jansako#3330
Technically possible but it is a different paradigm. AtomicDex uses lite wallets, mining or staking requires a full node. A lot of work to implement something that does not really add value. Maybe except for Staking, where you could stake your funds at the same time as they are used to provide liquidity (have maker orders with them).


[31-Jan-21 02:55 AM] jansako#3330
I think you could stake the funds in the same address on a different node though. i.e. import the same address to Verus Desktop & run it on the same machine as your DEX


[31-Jan-21 04:36 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
1) Staking KMD assets on atomicdex possible in future?
2) Ledger nano integration possible?
3) Have the currency listed in alphabetical order

[31-Jan-21 04:42 AM] Slyris#2880
1 - It's already possible to stake KMD on AtomicDEX Desktop

2 - Yes - everything is possible however it's will probably implemented in AtomicDEX-API (mm2) In order to be used from multiple platform (Desktop / Web, even mobile if you have the last Ledger with bluetooth)

3 - An Issue is already open regarding this topic, @syl Already assigned to it

PS: please don't ask the same questions across differents channels such as #üìà‚îÉtalk-trading - you can ask in one channel and ping one time, don't need to replicate the question everywhere

yes, you can use the DEX feature for trades. 
> How long does a swap take?
depends on the blocktimes of the coins involved. for BTC, it may take a few hours. take note of the fees before placing an order. if the txn fees are currently huge, the swap will take large fees

@0xPenguin0x

In Fact if BTC<->ETH swap should not take hours there is no dPOW security here.

> If I lose connection I could lose BTC?

No but if you disconnect too much time you can loose the fees used for this trade

> How can I check the fees

In the application when you are about to swap BTC <-> ETH you can check the fees in the box on the trading page


[31-Jan-21 09:08 PM] Slyris#2880
You have the fees on the right, but since you are Speaking about ETH and BTC, fees are really high right now

[02-Feb-21 11:23 PM] Komodefi#5638
liquidity always follows the path of least resistance. kmd has been building the panama canal for blockchains for over 7yrs now. It's not "currently in testnet" It's fucking real and it works right now. If people would rather give a large percentage of their assets away in gas and/or withdrawal fees, it's not the team's job to try and stop them. The solution is built. The solution will still be here 5 yrs from now. It's up to you to utilize the solution.


[03-Feb-21 12:06 AM] Alright#0419
just throwing this out there, not a promise or even a proposal, more a showerthought I asking others to give feedback on
```
bob has a limit order offering 2 TOKEN for 1 KMD

alice has COIN and wants TOKEN. There is no volume on this COIN/TOKEN pair. However, there is volume on both COIN/KMD and KMD/TOKEN

Alice says to the network "I want to buy 2 TOKEN with COIN". 

Charlie sees this and replies "I will buy bob's 2 TOKEN and sell them to you for 5 COIN". 

Alice agrees to pay 5 COIN for 2 TOKEN. 

Charlie now swaps his 1 KMD for bob's 2 TOKEN. 

Charlie now swaps his 2 TOKEN for alice's 5 COIN. 

Charlie has profited 1 COIN. Bob's order was filled as he originally posted it. Alice received the TOKEN she wanted. 
```
Basically automating something like this
Charlie could choose how much he will profit based on how likely he thinks both swaps will succeed, can set his risk profile basically
if we have competing charlies, this profit(and therefore alice slippage)  gets thinner and thinner
this seems a clear and direct incentive for market making, something we are lacking in atm
now instead of bobs providing volume on a dozen different pairs(ex: DOGE/BTC DOGE/KMD DOGE/BCH DOGE/LTC DOGE/ETH DOGE/DASH), they only really need to provide it on DOGE/KMD
should bring the spreads tighter on KMD pairs


[03-Feb-21 12:08 AM] Alright#0419
Thought of this with a sushi/uni AMM UX in mind. 
eg "I have coin x, I want coin y, click, done" 
not having to worry about what's going on in the backround, not needing liquidity on X/Y pair just some path from one to the other


[03-Feb-21 12:22 AM] Komodefi#5638
so as a bob you have an array of available tokens available thanks to the liquidity multiplication. bobs would have open orders for an array of tokens that only fulfill once alice figures out which token she wants to give bob her coin for. the order gets filled once bob knows what alice wants. after bob fulfills alice's request he has to place another set of orders across tokens.


[03-Feb-21 12:23 AM] Komodefi#5638
multiple bobs would compete for alice's coin by offering the lowest price?


[03-Feb-21 12:26 AM] Alright#0419
if that is a response to what I just said, I don't understand


[03-Feb-21 12:26 AM] Komodefi#5638
would placing the highest bid across multiple pairs as a bob mean that you can give alice her token the fastest?

[03-Feb-21 12:30 AM] Alright#0419
it allows alice to trade TOKEN/COIN without there actually being volume on that pair


[03-Feb-21 12:41 AM] Slyris#2880
In reality it is very different from sushi / uniswap - here we are talking about liquidity pool and the possibility of instant trading assets. An atomic swap takes time, the prices change between the start and end of the swap - Alice could end up with a much less interesting price in the end. It may be a subject that will be approached with instant swaps but for the moment it would seem very complicated to make a convincing system on that.

Note that there is already a multi orders feature that allows multiple orders on an asset and therefore liquidity.

I am in the process of developing a feature which allows to scan the orderbook to find the most interesting prices for a given volume.

not sure what you mean, bu i know that the original THC electrums are down... CHMEX set up a new one, but that is only in latest version... so go get 0.3.1.2 from https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/releases

Are all erc20 tradeable on atomicdex?


[03-Feb-21 12:27 PM] cipi#4502
the ones that follow the ERC20 standard... USDT does not eg


[03-Feb-21 12:28 PM] blubbi#0643
How conplicated is it to integrate new trading pairs following erc20 standard?


[03-Feb-21 12:29 PM] cipi#4502
add it as a custom token in ADEX Pro and post an order


[03-Feb-21 12:29 PM] blubbi#0643
So it isnt difficult nd time intense at all

[03-Feb-21 03:30 PM] Regnar#6164
This is a cool thought. I made a pretty basic arbitrage script that did something like this a while back to test on a centralized exchange. I didn't end up using it because the margins on the exchange were always too tight (almost like the exchange was beating me to it üòâ )


[03-Feb-21 03:36 PM] Regnar#6164
Basically I looked at 3 coins that all had a common coin in their pairing. (your example is a bit different because they don't have the 3rd pair). So, BTC/USDT, BTC/ETH, ETH/USDT. Then I calculated the prices of all the pairs (in the coin I want to profit in, BTC) 

so for example if 100 satoshi could buy $1 USDT on BTC/USDT, and 100 satoshi could buy 500 Wei on BTC/ETH, and 500 Wei could buy $1.10 USDT on ETH/USDT. 

This would use 100 satoshi BTC to buy 500 Wei ETH, the 500 Wei ETH to buy $1.10 USDT, and the $1.10 USDT to buy 110 satoshi BTC, ie. 100 satoshis becomes 110 satoshis.


[03-Feb-21 03:37 PM] Regnar#6164
and it would repeat until that gap was closed.


[03-Feb-21 03:56 PM] Regnar#6164
This honestly might be one of the bigger ideas I've heard to address DEX pair liquidity issues. I'm also brainstorming here so none of this is fully cooked.

If every pair also uses KMD as a base pair, technically every coin could route through KMD to another coin. 
If there is DOGE/KMD, and LTC/KMD. Why not something like DOGE/KMD/LTC?

so you could have DOGE/LTC, but if that isn't a hugely popular pair, there could be an option to route through KMD. Which means AtomicDEX instead looks at the LTC/KMD pairs for equivalent valued swaps (denominated somehow) to a DOGE/KMD and begins the HTLC for both pairs simultaneously.


[03-Feb-21 04:11 PM] superslack#6186
anyone know why you cant buy btc on atomic dex?


[03-Feb-21 04:33 PM] cipi#4502
likely because `"min_volume": "0.0193143"`... my BTC orders are atm at this level, because of the BTC txfee, so you need to buy at least 0.0193143 BTC


[03-Feb-21 04:34 PM] cipi#4502
buy you can post your own order and wait for it to be filled by someone else


[03-Feb-21 05:04 PM] Regnar#6164
Okay, here's my thought on how this would work.


[03-Feb-21 05:07 PM] Regnar#6164
```
-Alice has DOGE and some KMD (in her wallet) and she wants LTC, but doesn't have enough KMD for LTC (Or just wants to swap DOGE/LTC) but there isn't a DOGE/LTC market liquid enough.
-There is however an open KMD order for DOGE and an open LTC order for KMD (Because KMD pairs are most common)
-Bob has LTC and wants KMD, he doesn't want DOGE.
-Alice selects the "AtomicDEX instant liquidity" feature.
-She sends a taker payment with her DOGE to the open KMD/DOGE order, at the same time sending a KMD taker payment to the open KMD/LTC order (Bob).
-The KMD/DOGE Maker sends the maker payment and locks it awaiting Alices Taker Payment. Bob does the same, sending LTC to a HTLC awaiting Alice's Taker payment in KMD (She doesn't have enough KMD yet)
-Alice lets Bob's Maker payment sit in the HTLC while she finishes her DOGE/KMD Swap.
-When she receives the KMD, she immediately sends the KMD as the Taker Payment to Bob's HTLC.
-Bob sees the Taker payment for his LTC, and spends Alice's Taker payment
-Alice sees Bob revealed the secret to the HTLC and Spends Bob's LTC to herself

End result: Alice sells DOGE for KMD to a 3rd party while initiating a KMD/LTC swap. Bob sells his LTC for KMD to Alice```

No idea if the DEX fee and the following payments can be spent from different addresses though, I'm not sure what would be required to hijack that payment (if that's even possible)


[03-Feb-21 05:36 PM] Regnar#6164
I don't often ask jl777 questions in his channel but this seems really cool and something he'd know about/if it's possible.


[03-Feb-21 05:37 PM] Regnar#6164
with this, all you'd need is every coin against a KMD pair. Low liquidity pairs wouldn't have "low liquidity" as long as there was an equivalent value (Not sure how it'd be measured? USD? KMD?) of the opposite coin for KMD.


[03-Feb-21 05:44 PM] VandarGR#6065
Interesting approachüëÜ


[03-Feb-21 05:47 PM] Regnar#6164
I may be overthinking this though. It might not even be necessary. But it seems like it would be cool. @Jcharming put it on my list üòÇ


[03-Feb-21 05:51 PM] Regnar#6164
It might even add some value to holding KMD in your AtomicDEX wallet. Assuming this is possible you'd only need enough to make the DEX fee payment per trade, but the feature itself could be "unlocked" by holding a certain amount of KMD at all.


[03-Feb-21 08:25 PM] Pringle#4720
I would like to raise a token based liquidity incentive for peoples thoughts


[03-Feb-21 08:27 PM] Pringle#4720
There is somewhat of a chicken and egg problem when it comes to gaining traction for an exchange.
Initially there is no liquidity to low. As a consequence nobody wants to trade on the exchange and therefore there is no liquidity. The proposed model aims to bootstrap the liquidity and trading activity of the AtomicDex platform. This is achieved by:
1. incentivising market makers to provide liquidity in exchange for tokens (let the community decide on whether we use DEX or KMD or create a new token) which will be repurchased using trading fees collected by platform
2. incentivising traders to move their trading activity to the platform in exchange for tokens which will be repurchased using trading fees collected by platform


[03-Feb-21 08:30 PM] Pringle#4720
Traders with limit orders which execute will earn tokens according to the following formula:
TokenReward = 2/3 DailyDistribution(VolumeTraded/TotalPlatformVolume)
Traders executing market orders will earn tokens according to the following formula:
TokenReward =1/3 DailyDistribution(VolumeTradedTotal/PlatformVolume)


[03-Feb-21 08:32 PM] Pringle#4720
Anyway there is a lot of other tokenomics that can go into this model, e.g Token emission, Buybacks, Burns, Supply

Who should I chat with ref; adding  Liquidity and how that workd ?


[04-Feb-21 09:39 AM] lightspeed393#5403
Anyone can provide liquidity by placing buy/sell orders for coin pairs and keeping atomicdex running. This can be done with desktop, but also on servers with atomicDEX-api: https://github.com/komodoplatform/atomicdex-api.

How To Become a Liquidity Provider on AtomicDEX
The following tutorial introduces the reader to a simple method to become a liquidity provider on the main network of the AtomicDEX software.

[04-Feb-21 09:47 AM] Roger#1320
Ok so what your saying is buy creating a order you are adding liquidity ? So trying to compare to uniswap as there I would add liquidity to a pool and earn fees, here its seams I am just making orders


[04-Feb-21 10:00 AM] cipi#4502
You earn here too... just set your ask 3% higher and your bid 3% lower than market price and you earn through the spread


[04-Feb-21 10:04 AM] lightspeed393#5403
yes, all liquidity really is are orders available for people to buy and sell to. Most people want to click on an order in the orderbook and sell or buy right away. But marketmakers provide those orders(liquidity) for them to do so.


[04-Feb-21 10:05 AM] lightspeed393#5403
People just need to start selecting pairs for coins they own and setting some orders.


[04-Feb-21 10:05 AM] lightspeed393#5403
Like cipi said, you can set your rates higher and lower than market. It might take longer for them to fill if the price is far off, but the option is there for people to buy/sell.


[04-Feb-21 11:11 AM] Roger#1320
Ok I get it but its a  harder sell to outside liquidity suppliers. Say we have liquidity partner whos is willing to put 500k of liquidity in our token  pool on uniswap.  The gets balanced by arbitrage, so they get there liquidity back + fees for the time they supply.  In above they would end up with just our token back. Or am i missing something ?


[04-Feb-21 11:30 AM] VJ#1796
So instead of hoping to get money and not being out of pocket, you "make" your own arb opportunities by just listing above/under market for the liquid pairs you want to trade. @Roger

Super‚ù§


[05-Feb-21 07:22 AM] lightspeed393#5403
by providing liquidity/orders, what they get back is the coins they want for the prices they want.


[05-Feb-21 07:22 AM] lightspeed393#5403
I find it a bit funny that people want rewards/fees for everything they do. Why isn't just swapping to get the things you want enough without the platform giving you a reward?


[05-Feb-21 07:23 AM] lightspeed393#5403
If your order is say 3% more than market, those extra 3% of coins are a *reward*.

the backend/core of atomicdex. techincally anyone can submit a PR, but if a coin isn't a btc clone with the required RPC commands then code changes would need to be made by the team to support it.

if you mean you want hardware wallet support, it may come in the future. "be online" - the seed words/privkeys never leave your device

we have. it is just geo blocked in some locations currently

have you tried the desktop version without geo-blocks? what is your OS?

what do you mean? ADEX Desktop does not work with native wallets, only ADEX-API. And why not use the latest one?


[07-Feb-21 11:53 AM] Collider#6160
one of the older coins in my game hasnt been updated in a long while, its a litecoin fork and interested in which version they'd need to update to in order to be compatible with adex


[07-Feb-21 12:10 PM] cipi#4502
hard to say, maybe this list of rpc calls helps: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins#bitcoin-compatibles
i would simply try it out


[07-Feb-21 12:24 PM] Collider#6160
true can just try, all those rpc's are supported currently but does it need OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY support too?

there's a big discussion going on in #üìà‚îÉtalk-trading about this, you should go and read it. There isn't a proposed solution, other than people can set orders for above/below market price to make more money than they would on a CEX. imo this is a good enough reward, but others disagree and think there should be some sort of reward system for users who provide liquidity.

Not too sure if others are encountering this, have had this happen the last time i was using the desktop app on Windows 10. App still was functioning, but when i changed the coins in the DEX, they would not change, as if the DEX was frozen. I have to restart the app for it to work again.


[10-Feb-21 10:06 PM] VJ#1796
Somehow the DEX crashed but app was still working.


[10-Feb-21 10:34 PM] jspook16#3059
I've had the desktop app just kill itself multiple times one windows. On Linux, market makers dies after a while but app is still launched.

All of the views are quite nice. Will that just be another addition and traditional orderbook view will be staying as and option too? I like option 3 how it says Automatic for the swap constructor and then has a manual tab, which I guess is back to the orderbook as it is now?


[12-Feb-21 06:50 AM] Slyris#2880
We will likely have 2 view, one pro and one normal, the poll is mainly for the simple view aka the swap constructor


[12-Feb-21 06:50 AM] Slyris#2880
Pro view will probably the one with the new orderbook


[12-Feb-21 06:50 AM] Slyris#2880
just a modification of the current one, but for the simple one we are looking for something simple and nice


[12-Feb-21 06:51 AM] Slyris#2880

I think view #2 provides the most information in a simple manner that allows the user to be engaged up to the point of committing to the swap. I vote #2


[12-Feb-21 07:17 AM] Regnar#6164
This is somewhat of a throwback to the original AtomicDEX mobile which had no visible orderbook and just a "simple swap" interface. I thought that was perfect for mobile version and is good to add to the desktop version as well.

[12-Feb-21 12:56 PM] jansako#3330
It is dev effort to make & QA them all. The one most fit for purpose should be implemented. I voted, based on the specs you listed. The easiest to use is the one with the least choices/information/controls. üôÇ


[12-Feb-21 01:04 PM] VJ#1796
@Slyris Do you know why the desktop app on Windows gets "frozen" in that people cannot trade against it but the order is still visible and when you change the coin it will not show the new coin orderbook but stuck on the current one. All other functions works. This did not happen on the previous version of the DEX.


[12-Feb-21 02:11 PM] jspook16#3059
Question here. There is a member thats returning after a few years.... he has an old seed and private key (from old Agama Wallet). When he loads the seed in Atomicdex it returns a different public address. When he loads his private key into Ocean wallet he gets "Invalid private key encoding (code -5)". Is there way to recover? @bishop @Alright @BlackJesus  - tagging old members that i recognize

Additionally, maybe there is a cool way to explore initiatives and projects that are looking for funding within AtomicDEX address book. There could also be an "allocate KMD rewards" option, so you could split your rewards and allocate a certain percentage to various addresses as donations or funding


[14-Feb-21 06:53 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Would be cool, just a little unobtrusive "donate" button


[14-Feb-21 06:54 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Id probably end up drunk one day and spam that button üöÄ

A donate button on the AtomicDEX could be a great way to encourage communities like DOGE to uptake Atomic DEX.  A stream of donations for the developers has got to be a desirable feature for any community.


[15-Feb-21 05:28 AM] Corellian Engineering#8439
Imagine if Elon Musk smashed the Donate Button?

I just downloaded the latest beta version of atomicdex  040 but 1 it is not showing the price of our token from  https://coinpaprika.com/coin/eiln-e-ilien/ and it keeps kicking me out. i am using macbook with M1 m1 processor. Any ideas

Hey @Roger we are not using coinpaprika anymore but coingecko


[15-Feb-21 04:52 PM] Roger#1320
since when as we just got listed this week on coinpaprika  after weeks of work and know you change it?


[15-Feb-21 04:52 PM] Roger#1320
We go no notice


[15-Feb-21 04:54 PM] Roger#1320
price is showing on old version of atomicdex and when you go to add token it ask for the coinpaprika ID


[15-Feb-21 04:55 PM] Roger#1320
so will the price of our coin disappear as we are not listed on coingecko and could take a bit of time


[15-Feb-21 04:55 PM] Roger#1320
it also ask for coingecko id in version 040


[15-Feb-21 04:56 PM] Roger#1320
any help would be great. Kind Regards

[15-Feb-21 05:09 PM] Slyris#2880
@Roger


[15-Feb-21 05:10 PM] Roger#1320
so in old system you can use coinpaprika  and going forward it will be coingecko


[15-Feb-21 05:11 PM] Slyris#2880
Yes, because we cannot sustain with coinpaprika anymore


[15-Feb-21 05:11 PM] Slyris#2880
it requires 3 request/coin


[15-Feb-21 05:11 PM] Slyris#2880
meanwhile this time with coingecko we have one request for everything


[15-Feb-21 05:12 PM] Roger#1320
I can understand that, but it means all ecr-20 tokens not in coingecko will loose the price display


[15-Feb-21 05:14 PM] Roger#1320
when are you switching off coinpaprika  as we just did a press release last weekend  stating our price is now showing on atomicdex .


[15-Feb-21 05:15 PM] Roger#1320
we have 17k wallets that we are asking all to switch from Agama to atomicdex


[15-Feb-21 05:26 PM] Roger#1320
Also this will have a impact on getting tokens to use atomicdex as getting listed on coingecko is harder and requires an API on the tokens side.  If you can also explain if We do a IDO with you where is the price taken from after IDO?


[15-Feb-21 08:18 PM] Sdunbar#5064
is 0.4 still geoblocked?


[15-Feb-21 08:47 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Any chance of multiple addresses on atomicdex? I was thinking for (light) privacy/anonymity, if we could trade between coin a and b, but both coins were kmd

Person a wants to break trail, 100kmd order. Maybe 1% fee for this type of trade 

Person b sees it, decides to take offer. 
Atomic swap occurs between person a and b, but the addresses are new ones controlled by both parties, so not same address

Person a wants 100kmd in his secondary address pretty much. 

So person b sends 99kmd to person a secondary address

Person a sends 100kmd to person b secondary address

With the 1% fee, the amounts are 99 and 100, so tracing it wise it would also obscure it slightly rather than having same amount in and out


[15-Feb-21 08:48 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Obviously not fully anonymous, but it may help for certain people who would want this service :abusedsmily:


[15-Feb-21 08:48 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
And from the last incident, there‚Äôs no real ‚Äúdark‚Äù Komodo coins or ‚Äúillegal‚Äù ones, so shouldn‚Äôt have any blacklisting issues on exchanges as if it were ‚Äúbad‚Äù bitcoins etc


[15-Feb-21 08:51 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
For me. I‚Äôve got Komodo in 2 addresses. I‚Äôd like to merge them, but one has trails to foreign exchanges which I don‚Äôt wish to be connected to my main holdings


[15-Feb-21 08:51 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Would be nice to have a way where someone else can send kmd to my main address, and I can send them kmd from mine to theirs


[15-Feb-21 09:35 PM] VJ#1796
Just use 2 computers?


[15-Feb-21 09:38 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
As in if I have a 2nd kmd address which I don‚Äôt want connected to my own personal wallet for whatever reason, 

Same as if I send you 100kmd into a new address you have keys for. 

You send me 100kmd from your wallet into a new address for me @VJ


[15-Feb-21 09:39 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
That way my 2nd wallet never gets connected to my own


[15-Feb-21 09:39 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
That way I can even send those kmd into my main wallet


[15-Feb-21 09:40 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
But not have it linked to my 2nd wallet, since those funds are now in your control

[16-Feb-21 05:22 AM] Regnar#6164
I made a recommendation like this to PTYX, but as a simple option: including the donation address/name in the address book for new downloads.

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[16-Feb-21 05:31 AM] Regnar#6164
It might also be a decent idea to include some default "addresses" in the book (that don't have an address with them yet) so that people get a good idea of what they can use them for. for example, `AtomicDEX Mobile` `Ledger Nano X` `Discord TipBot` `Verus Desktop` `KMD Paper Wallet` etc. There might also be a need to separate "external" addresses from those owned by the user. Having a "My Wallets" section with a dropdown showing the above wallets would clean up the address book if you also had some addresses in there of your friends.


[16-Feb-21 05:35 AM] Regnar#6164
Also, when selecting KMD, ETH, or another coin with shared addresses across multiple coins/tokens, you should be able to select an option `Use this address for all <COIN TYPE> coins/token sent to this wallet` a good example of this would be selecting a Ledger address as KMD +all KMD smart chains that use the same address. So you could have a single Address in the address book but it works for all Komodo coins or ERC20, QRC20 etc.


[16-Feb-21 05:58 AM] jansako#3330
@Crabby Paddy  re- cross sending KMD to unconnected addresses. The latest from the UK tax authority (HMRC) is that it 'assumes' that any transactions coming or going from your 'known' addresses are considered as you transferring assets between your addresses. Otherwise they are considered 'trades' which you have to account for (& track for tax purposes etc.). The danger (not tested in courts yet) is that me transferring some KMD to your 'hidden' wallet would make them consider all of those funds mine. 'Boating accident' clause (basically no longer having a private key to an address) is no longer accepted unless YOU can prove it. Adding a feature like this to AtomicDex is would be super risky IMO. 
Doing 'regular' trades via Dex is OK cause you can show the 'b' address is not yours so it is 'obviously' a peer-to-peer trade. Not going into 'trading with yourself' now.


[16-Feb-21 06:00 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@jansako  But wouldnt you sending me kmd pretty much be a trade? There shouldnt be any laws against peer to peer trade, even if its for the same coin


[16-Feb-21 06:00 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Or call it a 99kmd loan for 1kmd interest


[16-Feb-21 06:00 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
:abusedsmily:


[16-Feb-21 06:02 AM] jansako#3330
trading is OK, just don't see any benefit you already do not have, like why U need to 'consolidate' holdings at all? Having them split amongst many addresses actually helps to stay under the radar. And if there is nothing illicit, then you do not need to 'break' the chain. Maybe I am missing something...


[16-Feb-21 06:24 AM] Slyris#2880
We already have everything for that in the 0.4.0.


[16-Feb-21 06:24 AM] Slyris#2880
Since we have tags / multiple address

I got the github 0.4 beta build. It loses connection way too often for my taste, several times a day I must re-log in. This was not happening in the previous versions. Same hardware. It this known? Seems the previous version was able to re-connect automagically so it 'only' needed a restart every few days when the orderbooks stopped updating on pair change...

Here is how it works:

If you close your computer or have a disconnection longer than 45 seconds you will be disconnected.

The reason for this somewhat aggressive implementation: https://github.com/microsoft/cpprestsdk/issues/660

Now the verification is a little more precise, it will only disconnect you if you have a huge timeout on all rpc calls, including external providers.

In the future if microsoft fixe the bug, we will be able to have an automatic reconnection without interupting the user

if it's the case this probably means admin rights


[19-Feb-21 09:56 PM] Slyris#2880
Because the zip archive you can use it on desktop or documents for example that doesn't require admin rights

@cryptofox and  @andy faced user admin rights problems using atomicdex installer @smkhound would be nice to have a full investigation i believe i understand the problem:

- Install atomicdex with admin user
- Launch atomicdex require admin rights
- atomicdex try to spawn a process with mm2 when you click login but there is no way to ask admin privilege here, mm2 fail to start -> crash


[19-Feb-21 10:25 PM] smkhound#7640
any logs to review?


[19-Feb-21 10:25 PM] Slyris#2880
Please be sure to be able to reproduce problem if its the case open an issue, one of the solution would be to not use mm2 binary anymore but use mm2 library instead, will also solve all antivirus problem

no problems here with 0.4.0 installer or logging in on my (admin) account.


[19-Feb-21 10:33 PM] smkhound#7640
setting up a non-admin account, will be a minute


[19-Feb-21 10:38 PM] Slyris#2880
yeah let's check every possibilities


[19-Feb-21 10:50 PM] smkhound#7640
issue identified. Only affects installer on non-admin accounts. Using zip archive does not suffer same problem


[19-Feb-21 10:50 PM] smkhound#7640
will add issue to github.


[19-Feb-21 10:53 PM] Slyris#2880
wait @smkhound when it's a non admin accounts let's say, you use the installer it ask for admin rights no ?


[19-Feb-21 10:54 PM] smkhound#7640
yeah, needs admin pw to install


[19-Feb-21 10:54 PM] Slyris#2880
So it's not only an mm2 issue ?


[19-Feb-21 10:55 PM] Slyris#2880
You mean even if you start the application without starting mm2 you have no appdata folder ?


[19-Feb-21 10:55 PM] smkhound#7640
I'd just generally advise as  I do with any windows stuff that needs admin when you dont have it, but has an alternative "portable" version, just use the portable.


[19-Feb-21 10:56 PM] smkhound#7640
mm2 doesnt launch because it doesnt have the MM2.json and coins file in the folder it expects (or access to that folder)


[19-Feb-21 10:56 PM] Slyris#2880
what shows `%APPDATA%` on this specific account?


[19-Feb-21 10:56 PM] smkhound#7640
basically when admin enters pw to install, those folders are setup under admin's %appdata%


[19-Feb-21 10:56 PM] smkhound#7640
so no folders or config for non-admin user.


[19-Feb-21 10:56 PM] Slyris#2880
Yeah but when you are not admin and launch it's should be in user %APPDATA%


[19-Feb-21 10:57 PM] smkhound#7640
yes, but the folders dont exist.


[19-Feb-21 10:57 PM] Slyris#2880
But what shows your env variable


[19-Feb-21 10:57 PM] Slyris#2880
%APPDATA% ?


[19-Feb-21 10:57 PM] smkhound#7640
for admin user, it has atomic_qt folder. for non-admin, it does not.


[19-Feb-21 10:58 PM] Slyris#2880
Yeah i mean the env variable exist alright ?


[19-Feb-21 10:58 PM] smkhound#7640
yeah


[19-Feb-21 10:58 PM] smkhound#7640
it always does


[19-Feb-21 10:58 PM] Slyris#2880
Can you please show me the install folder in non admin ?


[19-Feb-21 10:58 PM] Slyris#2880
as a screenshot


[19-Feb-21 10:59 PM] smkhound#7640
it has folder now because I did portable install. I'll need to clean up or do another profile again to replicate


[19-Feb-21 10:59 PM] Slyris#2880
I would like to see the install folder after the installation


[19-Feb-21 11:00 PM] Slyris#2880
also not a windows expert but what is the difference between `ALLUSERSAPPDATA` and `APPDATA` ?

[19-Feb-21 11:02 PM] Slyris#2880
```
The file-system directory that contains application data for all users. A typical path Windows is C:\ProgramData.
```

I wonder if this one require admin rights, for %APPDATA% it's:

```
The file-system directory that serves as a common repository for application-specific data. A typical path is C:\Documents and Settings\username\Application Data or C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming.
```


[19-Feb-21 11:05 PM] smkhound#7640
yeah c:\ProgramData should be accessible whereas another user's %appdata% profile is generally not (unless you are admin)


[19-Feb-21 11:05 PM] Slyris#2880
But your %appdata% should always be accessible


[19-Feb-21 11:05 PM] Slyris#2880
even if you are not admin

Have you tried to delete your local manifest file in the install folder and try again ?


[19-Feb-21 11:06 PM] smkhound#7640
yes, but if I am "running as admin" it wants to use admins %appdata%


[19-Feb-21 11:07 PM] smkhound#7640
possibly a write issue for the logs. Admin gives permission to run, but not modify their profile stuff


[19-Feb-21 11:07 PM] Slyris#2880
I believe you are running as admin because of the manifest file


[19-Feb-21 11:07 PM] smkhound#7640
easy to overcome with portable version. I've done this on Gov networks back when I was a wage slave and I couldnt install Sublime Text


[19-Feb-21 11:08 PM] Slyris#2880
And if you are "running" as admin you should have access during the session of your executable to %appdata% of admin since you give the password


[19-Feb-21 11:08 PM] Slyris#2880
Yes sure portable version is a solution


[19-Feb-21 11:08 PM] Slyris#2880
i just try to understand how does big compagny to avoid such problem


[19-Feb-21 11:09 PM] smkhound#7640
k, will dig more


[19-Feb-21 11:10 PM] smkhound#7640
probably by using c:\ProgramData folder tbh

I wonder if with |asInvoker| it will work


[19-Feb-21 11:10 PM] Slyris#2880
Ok please @smkhound i have an idea


[19-Feb-21 11:10 PM] Slyris#2880
can you modify the manifest file ?


[19-Feb-21 11:10 PM] Slyris#2880
and give a try ?


[19-Feb-21 11:10 PM] Slyris#2880
use level = `asInvoker`


[19-Feb-21 11:10 PM] Slyris#2880
instead of requireAdministrator


[19-Feb-21 11:11 PM] Slyris#2880
The manifest file should be where the binary is located with the installer

highestAvailable you use ?


[19-Feb-21 11:21 PM] smkhound#7640
`asInvoker`


[19-Feb-21 11:22 PM] Slyris#2880

Ok if this work @smkhound : Open an issue that explain the whole situation then, open a pr modifying `ci_tools_atomic_dex/installer/windows/packages/com.komodoplatform.atomicdex/data/atomicdex-desktop.exe.manifest` accordingly, then ping @syl it may impact his pr: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/pull/698 explain the choice etc

Maybe someone can approach them and maybe the community can help fund the cost? If it results in KMD price going up, having new users, I am sure we can do it.

Hey @RNR_0 $VIA is supported on @AtomicDEX but it seems the electrums are offline and they can't be traded atm. Any chance you can look into it? Might also be interesting to look at launching your own VIADEX skin like they did for $DOGE @dogecoindex

the amount of time any coins team would have to spend on reskinning the atomic dex api would more than pay for itself very quickly in fees that would not have to be paid to cex's by it's userbase. Also, let me put my tin foil hat on real quick and tell you about how this tech is being actively suppressed by cex owned crypto media.

that is the default rpc port and should not be opened. if you are on windows, you can select the program(mm2) and add it to firewall exceptions

Hey @here our new front-end dev @Enokas WeS started the V2 trading view in the following draft pull request: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/pull/695

Binaries will be available here: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/actions/runs/591821944

This is the implementation based on your feedback: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/issues/625

I would like to say thanks to everyone that and will participate to the discussion. Feel free to give feedback here and on the GitHub Pull request.

Simple trading view is not implemented yet, but it's on the way.

I wish you everyone an excellent and productive day.

Regarding other important topics, @syl another dev of the team is reworking rebranding part of the application to facilitate rebrand and customisation (aka DogeDex and other forks), pr here: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/pull/698

Is Geoblocking flagged on in this build?


[23-Feb-21 05:11 AM] daemonfox#6136
Tired if installing these only to find DEX deactivated.


[23-Feb-21 05:14 AM] Slyris#2880
yes its flagged on this build @daemonfox


[23-Feb-21 05:16 AM] daemonfox#6136
Thx. Wont be able to help then.


[23-Feb-21 05:18 AM] Slyris#2880
Sorry to hear that


[23-Feb-21 05:18 AM] daemonfox#6136
One of these days ill setup to build it myself with it unflagged, for now, I will wait to see in the Turkish team picks this up


[23-Feb-21 05:20 AM] daemonfox#6136
@phm87 any chance the team will put out their version of this build?


[23-Feb-21 05:21 AM] Slyris#2880
i believe @cipi can duplicate the branch


[23-Feb-21 05:21 AM] Slyris#2880
without geoblocking


[23-Feb-21 05:38 AM] phm87#7395
I don't know sorry, I don't use atomicdex-desktop, I use only atomicdex-api

TY!


[23-Feb-21 06:34 AM] Sdunbar#5064
It's already on the list of programs to allow through in windows.  Had to factory reset my router after a power outage, and now AtomicDex thinks I have no internet connection


[23-Feb-21 06:34 AM] Sdunbar#5064
prior to that I believe I had port forwarding to allow it but that was set up back in 2017/2018, have forgotten what was done


[23-Feb-21 08:07 AM] daemonfox#6136
Says it cancelled


[23-Feb-21 08:09 AM] daemonfox#6136
but is installing win version


[23-Feb-21 08:10 AM] daemonfox#6136
and does work


[23-Feb-21 08:10 AM] cipi#4502
yes, the osx build failed, i started a new build and also updated mm2 to beta-2.1.3106
https://github.com/cipig/atomicDEX-Desktop/actions/runs/593009171


[23-Feb-21 08:11 AM] daemonfox#6136

[23-Feb-21 08:11 AM] daemonfox#6136
thx for the quick turn around


[23-Feb-21 08:11 AM] daemonfox#6136
Looks slick


[23-Feb-21 08:40 AM] Sdunbar#5064
@gcharang It's a network firewall, sharing internet with the upstairs.  Allowing at windows firewall level is not effective


[23-Feb-21 08:42 AM] Sdunbar#5064
I think port forwarding was set up back in 2017 on the network firewall to be able to get things to work back then, atomic dex worked fine as well until router had to be reset to factory default after power outage.. need to it set up properly again but need to know which ports


[23-Feb-21 08:45 AM] cipi#4502
you don't need to open any incoming ports for AtomicDEX, only outgoing


[23-Feb-21 08:47 AM] cipi#4502
the problem is more likely on the firewall running on your windows


[23-Feb-21 08:52 AM] cipi#4502

is it Kaspersky?

No, just windows firewall


[23-Feb-21 08:55 AM] Sdunbar#5064
This problem occurred exactly the morning after router was reset to default settings


[23-Feb-21 08:56 AM] Sdunbar#5064
so all rules set up back in 2017 when i first started using barterdex/atomicdex/agama wallet were all reset


[23-Feb-21 08:58 AM] cipi#4502
atomicdex does not need any special ports on the incoming side, it works fine behind NAT routers, so no special rules needed


[23-Feb-21 09:02 AM] cipi#4502
can you access https://dexapi.cipig.net:10000/ from a browser?


[23-Feb-21 09:07 AM] daemonfox#6136
Seems there is an issue with prices in some fields.

It's because you don't have the good uni @daemonfox

In the settings


[23-Feb-21 09:09 AM] daemonfox#6136
Ah... need to readd with Coingecko ues


[23-Feb-21 09:09 AM] Slyris#2880
It's now officially listed


[23-Feb-21 09:09 AM] Slyris#2880
Yes


[23-Feb-21 09:09 AM] daemonfox#6136
TY


[23-Feb-21 09:09 AM] daemonfox#6136
Forgot that hapened


[23-Feb-21 09:09 AM] Slyris#2880
You can reset your assets configuration


[23-Feb-21 09:09 AM] Slyris#2880
Uniswap is listed


[23-Feb-21 09:13 AM] daemonfox#6136
Much better


[23-Feb-21 09:13 AM] daemonfox#6136
And everything just works even after making these changes


[23-Feb-21 09:20 AM] Sdunbar#5064
Yep can get there fine


[23-Feb-21 09:24 AM] cipi#4502
that means you can make outgoing connections to port 10000 (used by BTC electrums)
so router is not blocking those connections


[23-Feb-21 09:26 AM] daemonfox#6136
Are these column headers reversed?

[23-Feb-21 09:46 AM] Sdunbar#5064
Ok sounds good


[23-Feb-21 09:46 AM] Sdunbar#5064
seems very weird that coincidentally it stopped working immediately after router factory default reset


[23-Feb-21 09:47 AM] Sdunbar#5064
has to be related I'm thinking


[23-Feb-21 09:48 AM] cipi#4502
sounds so, but afaik there are no special rules needed on internet routers for AtomicDEX Desktop to work


[23-Feb-21 10:07 AM] Slyris#2880
This screen seems correct


[23-Feb-21 10:07 AM] Slyris#2880
This one too

Just doesnt read right to me


[23-Feb-21 10:08 AM] daemonfox#6136
QTY KMD is 500000?


[23-Feb-21 10:08 AM] Slyris#2880
If you multiply price with quantity you have total


[23-Feb-21 10:08 AM] daemonfox#6136
Math is fine


[23-Feb-21 10:08 AM] daemonfox#6136
HEADER labels are wrong


[23-Feb-21 10:09 AM] Slyris#2880
Ah you mean total ?


[23-Feb-21 10:09 AM] daemonfox#6136
In the SPACE ss, Qty(KMD is 500000 and Total(KMD) is 50


[23-Feb-21 10:09 AM] Slyris#2880
Let me check shortly


[23-Feb-21 10:09 AM] Slyris#2880
Ok ty


[23-Feb-21 10:09 AM] daemonfox#6136
its swapping the coin label


[23-Feb-21 10:09 AM] Slyris#2880
I thought it's was math


[23-Feb-21 10:09 AM] daemonfox#6136
nope seems all good in backend and math


[23-Feb-21 10:10 AM] daemonfox#6136
just those seem to be the wrong identifying variable in those headers


[23-Feb-21 10:10 AM] Slyris#2880
Ok ty


[23-Feb-21 10:10 AM] Slyris#2880
Btw are you using app in french ?


[23-Feb-21 10:10 AM] Slyris#2880

English


[23-Feb-21 10:10 AM] Sdunbar#5064
good to know. its the login screen where this occurs, try to enter wallet pw and get the no connection


[23-Feb-21 10:10 AM] Slyris#2880
Ok we need to fix that @Enokas WeS


[23-Feb-21 10:10 AM] daemonfox#6136

[23-Feb-21 10:11 AM] Slyris#2880

[23-Feb-21 10:11 AM] daemonfox#6136

[23-Feb-21 10:12 AM] daemonfox#6136
Still poking around more


[23-Feb-21 10:12 AM] Slyris#2880
Let me check if the error was here in the previous version


[23-Feb-21 10:12 AM] daemonfox#6136
All functional though only minor things so far


[23-Feb-21 10:13 AM] Slyris#2880
good to know ty for feedback


[23-Feb-21 10:13 AM] Slyris#2880
we will fix shortly


[23-Feb-21 10:13 AM] Slyris#2880
It's only on bids the error on label ?


[23-Feb-21 10:14 AM] daemonfox#6136
both sides


[23-Feb-21 10:14 AM] daemonfox#6136
and in both orientations


[23-Feb-21 10:14 AM] Slyris#2880
But its seems this bug was already present then


[23-Feb-21 10:14 AM] daemonfox#6136
So, its the variables are flipped int he code likely


[23-Feb-21 10:14 AM] Slyris#2880
yes sure


[23-Feb-21 10:14 AM] daemonfox#6136
let me check mine, I have the coingecko version as well still


[23-Feb-21 10:16 AM] Slyris#2880
This is strange on binance they have same


[23-Feb-21 10:16 AM] Slyris#2880
Price is always same as total


[23-Feb-21 10:16 AM] Slyris#2880
for the ticker


[23-Feb-21 10:16 AM] daemonfox#6136
So this is new build example

multi order still have some pb but we will arrange that


[23-Feb-21 10:21 AM] daemonfox#6136

Simple trading view is still not implemented yet


[23-Feb-21 10:22 AM] Slyris#2880
and 2 new things are coming: Minimum trading amount / manual fees calculation


[23-Feb-21 10:23 AM] Slyris#2880
Basically fees will not be calculated automatically because this is not accurate this will require a button `Calculate fees` which will calculate exact fees with your last input

latest build is in the making: https://github.com/cipig/atomicDEX-Desktop/actions


[23-Feb-21 11:00 AM] Slyris#2880
So basically for next split new stuff coming:

- New trading view
- New simple trading view
- Pie chart on dashboard for assets repartition
- Settings for DPOW
- Minimal trading amount
- More accurate fees with manual fees calculation (a new button)
- Offline staking (QTUM) for the moment
- Generics metadata file in the repo to facilitate fork and rebrand
- Some responsiveness

It's on my roadmap let's say


[23-Feb-21 11:07 AM] daemonfox#6136
So the multicoiin portion is still in progress? UI seems to work except for 1 thing, it assumes max coin amount of base coin selected? Can't customize it to a set amount or am I missing a toggle somewhere?


[23-Feb-21 11:07 AM] Slyris#2880
Not possible


[23-Feb-21 11:07 AM] daemonfox#6136
ok


[23-Feb-21 11:07 AM] Slyris#2880

Yes not adding BTc or ETH


[23-Feb-21 11:07 AM] Slyris#2880
If it's match one you want to cancel the other


[23-Feb-21 11:07 AM] daemonfox#6136
or ERC20 in this case


[23-Feb-21 11:08 AM] Slyris#2880
Full balance is a way to cancel others


[23-Feb-21 11:08 AM] daemonfox#6136
I was wondering how the auto cancel dogeDEX mentioned worked


[23-Feb-21 11:08 AM] Slyris#2880

"First, transaction fees are minimal‚Äî just 0.15% of the total value of the trade. Only one party in the trade (the ‚Äútaker‚Äù) must pay a fee.

[23-Feb-21 11:51 AM] cipi#4502
0.15% (or 1/777 of taker coin) is the fee payed to AtomicDEX
the high txfee costs you see are from the BTC chain, sending transactions of BTC chain cost a fee and that is high: https://blockchair.com/bitcoin


[23-Feb-21 11:52 AM] xavi#1361
where can i adjust the fee for the transaction? i remember when i did a trade i could adjust that depending on how fast i wanted it to go through


[23-Feb-21 11:52 AM] xavi#1361
sorry, not a trade, but a send *


[23-Feb-21 11:53 AM] xavi#1361
so i'm willing to pay 10$ for this transaction, not 145$, where can i manually adjust that?


[23-Feb-21 11:53 AM] cipi#4502
you can only adjust the fee on a withdraw, the fees for the swapping are taken from the respective chains
```
bitcoin-cli estimatesmartfee 1
{
  "feerate": 0.00156448,
  "blocks": 2
}
```


[23-Feb-21 11:54 AM] cipi#4502
this picture is from a swap, not a withdraw


[23-Feb-21 11:54 AM] xavi#1361
ok, this is not what i expected tbh. yes, it's from a swap, indeed.


[23-Feb-21 11:55 AM] xavi#1361
i just transferred 200$ of bitcoin to make a small transaction and learn your atomicdex software, and this is what i get xD fun...not


[23-Feb-21 11:57 AM] xavi#1361
(also a macos developer, hi cipi and thanks for the explanation) any thoughts on what can i do with the BTC i transferred here to atomic dex with a 46$ fee from binance? i mean... i can transfer it back i guess, but i guess that's the end of my experiments here, right?


[23-Feb-21 11:58 AM] cipi#4502
those are the transaction fees on the BTC chain atm, see block explorer link i posted, we can't change them, it's not on us
if you want to save fees during a swap, you need to use other coins (LTC, BCH, KMD) or wait for the fees to get lower (usually on weekends)


[23-Feb-21 11:59 AM] xavi#1361
i don't understand one thing, i transferred 200$ worth of bitcoins from binance to atomicdex with a fee of 46$ (on binance), how could it be so cheap from binance, and so expensive - 145$ - on atomicdex


[23-Feb-21 11:59 AM] xavi#1361
?


[23-Feb-21 12:00 PM] xavi#1361
i'm missing some information most probably, maybe binance takes care of the fees? and i got a 100$ deduction of some sorts?


[23-Feb-21 12:00 PM] xavi#1361
( it was not mentioned anything of this kind )


[23-Feb-21 12:01 PM] Cryptoon#3362
$145 is for a swap


[23-Feb-21 12:01 PM] Cryptoon#3362
not a tx


[23-Feb-21 12:02 PM] cipi#4502
the fee calculation in AtomicDEX is not accurate atm, and for a swap (if using BTC as takercoin) it needs 2 BTC transactions, (one for the 0.15% fee and one for the actual payment)


[23-Feb-21 12:03 PM] cipi#4502
see https://discord.com/channels/412898016371015680/705374203972419616/813847683873505290
`- More accurate fees with manual fees calculation (a new button)` on the "roadmap"


[23-Feb-21 12:04 PM] xavi#1361
i see, can i help with this getting faster done from the roadmap? i'm a c++ and objective-c / objective-c++ developer

sure, please ask@Slyris


[23-Feb-21 12:07 PM] cipi#4502
there is also this as an open issue in the API: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/715
when implemented it will reduce the amount of needed BTC transaction per swap from 2 to 1, so basically saving you half the txfees

That's why the high supply coins are highly needed IMHO. Their fees will always be extremely lower !

[24-Feb-21 07:45 AM] Slyris#2880
well if it's a priority then we will spend 2 weeks on that and suspend other tasks because basically need to modify the whole code base so cannot start new UI features at the same time


[24-Feb-21 07:45 AM] Slyris#2880
But i believe it's important

[25-Feb-21 04:46 AM] VandarGR#6065
Maybe because of the gas fee man ?


[25-Feb-21 04:49 AM] cipi#4502
send should let you enter any amount you wish

Im the maker


[25-Feb-21 04:55 AM] daemonfox#6136
Its an open order you can see now


[25-Feb-21 04:56 AM] daemonfox#6136
It doesn't move coins, there are no outbound utxos noted in each coin list, but the amounts of the swap total has reduced each time as if it did

[25-Feb-21 04:57 AM] daemonfox#6136
This order was for over 400 KMD worth to start, no trade has succeeded in matching a small portion.


[25-Feb-21 04:59 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah I'm aware of this one I believe it's the normal behavior since swaps and orders are different things


[25-Feb-21 04:59 AM] Slyris#2880
Maybe the other part was disconnecting during a swap


[25-Feb-21 05:08 AM] daemonfox#6136
Just odd it reduces the liquidity originally defined even though it fails


[25-Feb-21 05:08 AM] daemonfox#6136
means if it keeps up the order might drop completely without ever swapping coins


[25-Feb-21 05:09 AM] daemonfox#6136
and without knowing what happened ont he other side, can;t tell if bug or taker DCd


[25-Feb-21 05:21 AM] cipi#4502
if you are maker and takercoin is DOGE than it's normal when the taker uses an older version of AtomicDEX that doesn't have the dust fix
this is error on taker side: https://dexapi.cipig.net/public/error.php?uuid=4a9bab75-c194-4801-8e5d-6b167f406acc
`the transaction was rejected by network rules. n64: dust` and he uses atomicDEX 0.3.3 iOS, which does not have the fix


[25-Feb-21 05:26 AM] cipi#4502
@daemonfox but no funds were sent from maker for 4a9bab75-c194-4801-8e5d-6b167f406acc, if taker can't send takerfee, maker does not send anything, only if taker fails later, eg on TakerPayment


[25-Feb-21 05:27 AM] daemonfox#6136
Yup funds are #SAFU


[25-Feb-21 05:29 AM] cipi#4502
btw, you can use the above link to check error and version used of other side, you just need the swap uuid

@cipi is the action from a couple hours ago working for this today?


[26-Feb-21 08:57 AM] cipi#4502
it has latest code from dev branch, but also from another branch, that will not be in 0.4.0, but 0.5.0
why you ask?


[26-Feb-21 08:59 AM] daemonfox#6136
Cuz the main release was supposed to be Geoblocked

https://github.com/cipig/atomicDEX-Desktop/actions/runs/603419469 has only the stuff from 0.4.0, but it takes 30 minutes to build

I really appreciate you making these... hopefully we get to a point where AML/KYC and Geoblock triggering can happen in app


[26-Feb-21 09:18 AM] daemonfox#6136
as much as many want to remain on the fringes, plenty of us are ready to be public


[26-Feb-21 09:19 AM] daemonfox#6136
and a form to KYC that flips the DEX back on in the prod version would be the goal right?

Hi all.  Crypto n00b, so please bear with me... Just discovered Komodo / AtomicDex for the first time on Twitter.  Only a few minutes into the video and I knew I had to find you all to learn more.  Looks amazing.
Curious if anyone else had a Windows Defender warning when trying to install the desktop app?  It stopped me from installing.


[26-Feb-21 01:28 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes , you have to click read more and it will pop up with a run anyway.  Will be fixed eventually has to do with submitting developer signing stuff to Microsoft . Also because of crypto libraries used gets flagged by AV sometimes


[26-Feb-21 01:30 PM] Revelucian#9106

Best place to post bug reports?  That key entry thing is a real headache.  It is quite finicky about letting me enter numbers in the Volume and price fields.  You can usually manage, but many times the fields just do not work as they should.  Acts like some sort of Javascript limiting/stopping key presses or something.

[27-Feb-21 12:38 AM] gcharang#6833
the official version had geo blocks from the last 2 versions. maybe you used the marmara version last time. for now, you can use the application from here: https://github.com/cipig/atomicDEX-Desktop/actions/runs/603419469 to use the latest version without geoblocks

the geoblock will be removed from the official versions also, soon

it is to protect users from having to pay 15% of the trade volume as transaction fees when the fees go too high in btc and eth

we will make the limit configurable in future versions

Do I need ETH in my wallet for transaction fees any time I am either buying or selling any ERC token, or does the Taker pay all fees?


[27-Feb-21 02:08 PM] TranslucentMonkey#9147
As an example, If I want to sell some DAI for KMD, do i need to send some ETH to my wallet to support this, or will the buyer pick up the tab.


[27-Feb-21 02:11 PM] cipi#4502
yes, you need ETH to perform any transaction on the ETH chain, so for sending DAI you would need some ETH

@Slyris what do you think about adding a voting system in atomicdex based on KMD. So 1 KMD equals 1 Vote and projects would need to vote to get a "free" listing


[28-Feb-21 04:44 PM] PTYX#6840
If we do something like 1 free listing per month. We let the projects apply, we pick the top 3, let their community vote through atomicdex in KMD


[28-Feb-21 04:45 PM] PTYX#6840
How could we make it fair so that one whale can't vote a project in? Maybe limiting to 1 vote per atomicdex wallet.... Idk, I'm just spit balling ideas based on the 1 month free listing thing


[28-Feb-21 05:38 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Make it actually cost kmd


[28-Feb-21 05:38 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
To vote


[28-Feb-21 05:38 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
But the issue arrives with coins voted in but not easily integrated


[28-Feb-21 07:05 PM] Slyris#2880
All listing in desktop are free because it's open source


[28-Feb-21 07:05 PM] Slyris#2880
But it's up to the user to do the pull request


[28-Feb-21 07:34 PM] actionslacks#4072
create VOTE/3/2021 and put them up on atomic dex for .1 kmd


[28-Feb-21 07:35 PM] actionslacks#4072
just make it contingent on current compatibility


[28-Feb-21 07:38 PM] actionslacks#4072
a portion goes to NN and integration costs and excess kmd are returned to the winning project to make their market pairs with.


[28-Feb-21 09:15 PM] VJ#1796
Why not KISS? Have 6000KMD requirement to get listed, wait till the community raises that then it gets added?


[28-Feb-21 09:21 PM] actionslacks#4072
I guess the question is how are the funds distributed


[01-Mar-21 07:13 AM] viaoliver#4065
i am about to make a video for grs-ltc swap. Does AtomicDex need to stay open after I place a makerorder? Can I open 2 instances at the same time in Windows?


[01-Mar-21 07:13 AM] viaoliver#4065
my plan is in one wallet i hold grs and want to make a makerorder where i sell grs against ltc and in the other i want to fill this order.


[01-Mar-21 07:16 AM] lightspeed393#5403
yes the app needs to stay open for maker orders. I *don't think* 2 instances can run on the same machine.


[01-Mar-21 07:33 AM] cipi#4502
they need to use different seeds/addresses... but i haven't tried on the exact the same machine, maybe there are some conflicts with userhome dir and local config and logfiles and stuff


[01-Mar-21 07:34 AM] viaoliver#4065
okay thx for the quick answer


[01-Mar-21 07:34 AM] cipi#4502
VM should work, or different user (in linux)


[01-Mar-21 07:35 AM] viaoliver#4065
yeah good idea


[01-Mar-21 07:35 AM] viaoliver#4065
will try


[01-Mar-21 07:50 AM] cipi#4502

[01-Mar-21 03:18 PM] cipi#4502
if you are on AtomicDex Desktop 0.3.1-beta, you need to update to 0.4.0, takerfee error on DOGE send is solved

That is what im using too

[02-Mar-21 06:50 AM] cipi#4502
if you are in a geoblocked region use a VPN or this version: https://github.com/marmarachain/atomicDEX-Desktop/releases (same as 0.4.0 just without the block)

What do you say about idea to integrate Faucet into the DEX, so user will spend more time there with open wallet and they will be able to start using DEX almost immediately? You can for start add there Browser like Coinomi


[03-Mar-21 05:35 AM] Agnostic#7681
this will add more value there @Audo  what do you think?


[03-Mar-21 05:36 AM] Komodefi#5638
rick and morty faucet is already there


[03-Mar-21 05:40 AM] Agnostic#7681
it should be somewhere under **dashboard** to be more visible


[03-Mar-21 05:41 AM] Agnostic#7681
maybe right under DEX


[03-Mar-21 05:43 AM] jansako#3330
faucet is only useful for first few runs, then it becomes an eyesore. 
Maybe as an alternative, on first launch with a brand new wallet it could ask the user 'do you want to enable 'demo' or 'tutorial' mode? If yes, then enable Rick & Morty and do a claim from the faucet. Then tell the user: Here are a few coins, go ahead & try swapping them.


[03-Mar-21 05:44 AM] Agnostic#7681
yeah sounds good ^^


[03-Mar-21 05:45 AM] Agnostic#7681
btw what about browser in app? Like one Coinimi has?


[03-Mar-21 05:46 AM] jansako#3330
what would the browser do? As in what is its purpose?


[03-Mar-21 05:49 AM] Agnostic#7681
well, this will extend purpose of the wallet so it can be connected to other swaps like UNI  1INCH like metamask do, this is convenient as vampire attack.


[03-Mar-21 05:50 AM] Agnostic#7681
if feasible


[03-Mar-21 05:53 AM] jansako#3330
This would be a larger design/purpose decision, if/how much  AtomicDex is going for a jack-of-all-trades approach.


[03-Mar-21 05:54 AM] Agnostic#7681
Dex has better GUI than most of those  SWAPS


[03-Mar-21 05:54 AM] gcharang#6833
not sure the desktop/mobile versions can support this feature. but, the web version will most likely have such features


[03-Mar-21 05:58 AM] Agnostic#7681
it would be cool to have an ability wallet to add this token immediately by getting all info about token from Coingecko for example, so you dont need to add it manually like metamask


[03-Mar-21 07:52 AM] Slyris#2880
It's already present


[03-Mar-21 10:18 AM] Slyris#2880

Are certain coins in Atomicdex geoblocked in different locations. My RVN/SPACE/DOGE disappear from the wallet depending on which country I set my vpn to?


[04-Mar-21 08:47 AM] Clyde At Liberty#3664
Prior to 0.4.0 I did not need the vpn, so I have no way of testing to see if that is part of the problem


[04-Mar-21 08:49 AM] gcharang#6833
hmm, interesting issue. most likely issue is access to electrum servers is being cutoff some times. if you don't enable VPN, are you able to access all coins?


[04-Mar-21 08:55 AM] Clyde At Liberty#3664
Nvm I think it is related to the "Show only coins with balance" also hiding the wallet coins. 

It was weird that moving VPn locations was throwing up errors on some of the assets though.


[04-Mar-21 08:56 AM] Clyde At Liberty#3664
And of course now I cannot reproduce the errors...


[04-Mar-21 08:58 AM] gcharang#6833
haha, no problem. maybe the electrum servers had problems at the same time you were switching VPN on and off. please ping me if you face the issue again

Hello, I having some trouble with the DEX. Wanted to sell some FTC for BTC. There is 4 buy orders at 0.00000090 sats but when i try to sell, it is adding a new sell order on the sell side and the order is not processed. I have entered an order at 0.00000089 and its showed on the sell order now with a lower price than the highest buy order. Could you please help?


[07-Mar-21 06:36 AM] gcharang#6833
if you click one of the available orders, it will autofill the fields and once you verify them, can click "Start swap". this will let you fill an exisiting order


[07-Mar-21 06:38 AM] CHMEX#0686
there might be a minimum order amount on the buyer


[07-Mar-21 06:38 AM] Ludo Nakamoto#3325
Thank you . I did that a few times before without issue but now it doesn't work. The minimum condition is met as well


[07-Mar-21 06:39 AM] Ludo Nakamoto#3325
The buy order is 10,000 FTC at 90 sats so 0.009 BTC. There is 4 different buys orders at that same price showing on the list.


[07-Mar-21 06:40 AM] Ludo Nakamoto#3325

[07-Mar-21 06:45 AM] Ludo Nakamoto#3325
when i try to sell at 90 sats (by selecting one of the order), the a new sell order is created on the ask side and not filled.


[07-Mar-21 06:49 AM] gcharang#6833
maybe the order is stale and doesn't exist any more?

does the ui give you any information? like: try to start swap 0/3 etc ?


[07-Mar-21 06:58 AM] Ludo Nakamoto#3325
no, it is just creating a new sell order like if none were existing on the buy side; so i suppose indeed that the buy oders doesn't realy exist anymore but why are they showing.


[07-Mar-21 07:12 AM] c2k#6034
curious to know if a lot of people are using AtomicDex just as an exchange or are there people who are using it as a Dex wallet also?


[07-Mar-21 07:13 AM] gcharang#6833
maybe because the orderbooks take time to update. cc: @Slyris @cipi


[07-Mar-21 07:24 AM] cipi#4502
the taker order is converted to a maker order when it does not match after idk 10s or so
question is why it does not match, because the params are ok
could be that the maker banned you... this happens when a swap between you and this maker already failed
if you restart your AtomicDEX, the ban on your side will go away if there was one... just not on maker side, but it's worth a try


[07-Mar-21 07:48 AM] jansako#3330
Coudl it be a min order situation?


[07-Mar-21 07:49 AM] jansako#3330
he is trying to buy 0.009 BTC worth...


[07-Mar-21 07:49 AM] cipi#4502
no, i looked in the orderbook on CLI, there is just the default min_volume of 0.00777


[07-Mar-21 07:51 AM] cipi#4502
it's actually a bit strange
```
      "price": "0.00000085",
      "maxvolume": "0.0085",
      "min_volume": "0.0000000066045"
```
i thought it is not possible to set min_volume < 0.00777


[07-Mar-21 07:51 AM] jansako#3330
maybe the bug with the balance transferred out?


[07-Mar-21 07:51 AM] cipi#4502
all the buy orders are from the same maker


[07-Mar-21 07:52 AM] Ludo Nakamoto#3325
thank you. The restart doesn't work but i made a full clean-up and now it works great. May be i was banned for some reason. What is the criteria for the ban (is link to wallet or ip?)


[07-Mar-21 07:52 AM] jansako#3330
yeah, if he set them, then transferred the coins out...


[07-Mar-21 07:52 AM] cipi#4502
it's the pubkey, so basically your address/seed


[07-Mar-21 07:57 AM] Ludo Nakamoto#3325
ok, so during my clean-up i did a transfer out, delete my wallet, create a new one and transfer in. So basicaly I was with a new address / seed hence it resolves. But still not sure why i was blocked.


[07-Mar-21 07:59 AM] cipi#4502
haha, that explains it...  there is a banning mechanism in mm2... it bans pubkeys of other nodes if swaps fail... ban is cleared when restarted or when `unban` is called explicitly... have you tried to swap with that maker in the past and swap has failed?


[07-Mar-21 08:07 AM] Ludo Nakamoto#3325
Not that I am aware off. Didn't get error message or something. I just had a look in the blockchain and indeed the same maker bough me some FTC already yesterday. So maybe something went wrong at some stage and caused the ban.


[07-Mar-21 08:08 AM] Ludo Nakamoto#3325
Would be great to have some notice on the interface because it is a strange behaviour when you're banned.


[07-Mar-21 08:11 AM] cipi#4502
maybe https://dexapi.cipig.net/public/error.php?uuid=8d629fca-8990-43b3-af67-e81123bea3be
yes, would be good to have ban-handling in the GUI

yeah might be. I will come back to you if the same problem occur again. Thank you for the support. Appreciate it.

[09-Mar-21 12:59 AM] jansako#3330
It was the guardian angel of crypto... because the price dropped so much, it would not let you fill my buy order. TBH not sure why, my maker orders get filled all the time. Just not this one. I cancelled it & created a new buy (for a more appropriate price).

people who updated from 0.3.1.2 or any other intermediary release need to reset their asset config in order to avoid dust errors on LTC, DOGE and many more


[09-Mar-21 02:06 AM] cipi#4502
@daemonfox is this from you? https://dexapi.cipig.net/public/error.php?uuid=8d5df5cc-4cca-4db4-819d-d9832d8716ef
taker waited too long for KMD notarization... you can disable notarizations for KMD though
btw, nodes are banning other nodes when swaps fail, so `e178fe139d2fce7571c2031a7cabc270b66e27765f411f0080a043922aed36db` is banned on my node now... i will unban it


[09-Mar-21 02:58 AM] jansako#3330
How does 'being banned' manifest on the node that is banned? Will the orders not show at all or will they just never match?


[09-Mar-21 03:16 AM] cipi#4502
i am not sure, i saw both... i think the difference is also who bans who, you the other node or the other node you
on maker side i saw output like "node is banned" in console in the past, but can't find it atm


[09-Mar-21 03:18 AM] cipi#4502
i guess when you ban the other one, the order is not visible in the orderbook, but when the other node banned you, you see it, since your node can't know that it is banned and so can't filter out those orders


[09-Mar-21 03:19 AM] jansako#3330
Feels like there should be some UI indication/effect, but like you said, the node that is banned would need a way to to know that it is banned in the first place

Hi all have down loaded Atomic Dex AtomicDEX Desktop v0.3.1.2 beta but when i open the Wallet it crashes with a message Fatel Error


[09-Mar-21 12:30 PM] cipi#4502
you should use 0.4.0 https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/releases and reset asset configuration in settings after update from 0.3.1.2


[09-Mar-21 12:38 PM] harvestmoon#2717
I had to version before 0.4,0 and it was working perfect but i seen somewhere that was advising users to update to 0.4.0 and when i done this it just kept crashing with the error


[09-Mar-21 12:39 PM] harvestmoon#2717
But in saying that i downloaded the version you recommended and it is still open and hasnt crashed yet

0.3.1.2 was internally already named 0.4.0, because it was done as an intermediary release, maybe the confusion comes from there

Who do we have to ask to push for a coin listing ? I'd like to see Particl PART listed on atomicdex and i believe it's compatible (it has the bitcoin compatible prerequisites)


[09-Mar-21 01:11 PM] cipi#4502
i once tried to add PART to BarterDEX (previous version), but failed because they changed something in tx serialization format: https://github.com/particl/particl-core/issues/35#issuecomment-377281329
you could try again and make a PR to https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins when successful


[09-Mar-21 01:14 PM] cipi#4502
if it doesn't work, it will need changes to AtomicDEX-API to support the changed format


[09-Mar-21 01:17 PM] cipi#4502
for GUI support, it will also need electrumx support, couldn't find PART in https://github.com/spesmilo/electrumx/blob/master/electrumx/lib/coins.py

I have been using AtomicDEX Desktop 0.4.0 on Ubuntu 20.10 for a couple weeks with no issues.  Today I am only able to display Komodo and Bitcoin, though my wallet contains several other currencies (which always displayed correctly in the past).  The "TOTAL" value displayed on the dashboard still includes those other currencies.  Is this the right place to bring this up?


[10-Mar-21 12:13 PM] LastActionFiero#2922
Ah - as mentioned above I reset the asset configuration and that fixed it

Hello, one gentle miner would like to mine different coins to his AtomicDex address. On pool side, we need one address per cryptocurrency, it can be changed in case of bugs. The miner will use different atomicdex installations and different seeds (or ocean QT or verus agama) but would it be possible to be able to generate a new address on AtomicDEX ? It can be good to enhance privacy

I understand your frustration about geoblock but AtomicDEX want to avoid risk for DEX Devs so they added geoblock in the official version. There is no geoblock in marmara version and some other versions. Sorry I forgot that Canada was in the list

Is there some kind of protection? Is such an attack possible?


[17-Mar-21 09:03 AM] Ghyttt#1389
The maker interrupts the swap and the taker constantly loses the commission.


[17-Mar-21 09:09 AM] Ghyttt#1389
Or does the maker also give the commission before the taker gives it?


[17-Mar-21 09:12 AM] cipi#4502
maker pays no trading fee, only taker pays 0.13% (1/777)
if swaps fail, nodes ban each other... this banning needs some improvements though


[17-Mar-21 09:13 AM] Ghyttt#1389
It turns out that such an attack is possible at the moment?


[17-Mar-21 09:14 AM] Ghyttt#1389
The attack is aimed at making the taker constantly lose commission.


[17-Mar-21 09:15 AM] cipi#4502
yes, but why would taker do the swap a second time with the same maker that was failing the swap?


[17-Mar-21 09:16 AM] cipi#4502
need to check, but i guess the orderbook entry from such a maker would not be visible in takers orderbook a second time, only after a restart


[17-Mar-21 09:19 AM] Ghyttt#1389
To be honest, this is a big problem even for one time, if, for example, it will be large sums. This problem must be solved somehow.


[17-Mar-21 09:23 AM] Ghyttt#1389
Perhaps a simple solution would be a small maker commission.


[17-Mar-21 09:26 AM] cipi#4502
the commission you are talking about is only 0.13%... the txfees are something else, maker looses those too when taker drops out of swap, which is the much more common case
txfees are also only a problem on BTC and ERC20 and i hope https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/715 will be implemented sooner than later, so this problem will be solved for TakerFee payment


[17-Mar-21 09:29 AM] cipi#4502
if 715 is done, https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/675 can be implemented too... you may want to look at the open issues in API repo, there are some that deal with this problems


[17-Mar-21 09:35 AM] Ghyttt#1389
Thanks for the links, I was just worried about this question and I wanted to know if such a problem is possible.


[17-Mar-21 09:38 AM] cipi#4502
a complete solution of the problem would be to modify the entire atomic swap protocol: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/823#issuecomment-780107532
the "American Call Option"

[18-Mar-21 02:47 PM] Deleted_account#6986
The first thing that the user is asked to do is to TYPE his freaking seed in a input field?


[18-Mar-21 02:48 PM] Deleted_account#6986
What is the point? It does not encourage the user to backup the seed at all


[18-Mar-21 02:49 PM] Deleted_account#6986
And the worst, is that it allows keyloggers to get your seed as soon as you create your wallet on Atomix Dex


[18-Mar-21 02:50 PM] lightspeed393#5403
There's a giant red warning when creating a wallet that says `Important: Back up your seed phrase before proceeding!`


[18-Mar-21 02:50 PM] lightspeed393#5403
Also you don't have to physically type it, you can copy the seed, and then paste it to confirm


[18-Mar-21 02:50 PM] lightspeed393#5403
You just have to type the individual words it asks for to confirm you actually did back it up


[18-Mar-21 02:50 PM] Deleted_account#6986
Right, because clipboard is also something much secured :D...


[18-Mar-21 02:51 PM] Deleted_account#6986
Desktop wallets are already the worst way to store funds, at least make the UX in a way that the user does not have to interact with the seed at all, aside reading it on the screen.


[18-Mar-21 02:52 PM] Deleted_account#6986
Which means that the user should not be able to copy it, nor he should ever be asked to type it


[18-Mar-21 02:54 PM] lightspeed393#5403
The user doesn't have to interact with the seed at all after creating. That's why it has a password to encrypt it on your computer. So next log in you just type the password for your wallet and it loads the seed. The only point of the initial part is to make sure you actually back up your seed. The wallet can't handle backup itself.


[18-Mar-21 02:54 PM] lightspeed393#5403
If your computer crashes and loses all data, you need to be able to recover it with the seed you have saved


[18-Mar-21 02:54 PM] lightspeed393#5403
That's why it says, Recommended to store offline.


[18-Mar-21 02:54 PM] Deleted_account#6986
An UX I find smart is to have to screen:
* First screen you show the seed with a checkbox "I have backed up my seed in secured place blabla"
* Then on the second screen the user will just have to click on some buttons to verifiy that he did backed it up (he has to check his backup to pass that process), for example "Choose the word 6 from thoses choices", "Choose the word 10 from those choices" ... just a couple of them is enough


[18-Mar-21 02:55 PM] lightspeed393#5403
did you actually create a wallet?


[18-Mar-21 02:55 PM] lightspeed393#5403
it does that exact thing


[18-Mar-21 02:55 PM] Deleted_account#6986
@lightspeed393 I know how this works. But encrypting the seed is useless if a keylogger or clipboard logger can read it before it's encrypted lol

[18-Mar-21 03:04 PM] Deleted_account#6986
Security is about reducing as much as possible the attack surface, it's not about being 100% secure (since it's impossible)


[18-Mar-21 03:04 PM] Deleted_account#6986
A windows machine should always be considered as infected by default, and reduce as much as possible the possible way to be rekt


[18-Mar-21 03:05 PM] Deleted_account#6986
Asking the user to type or copy/paste the seed is an obvious things to avoid as key loggers is probbably the most common way people get their seed stolen (don't know if clipboard loggers are that common)

[18-Mar-21 03:48 PM] cipi#4502
the KMD WIF of that seed would work for sure... was `curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"calcaddress\",\"passphrase\":\"yoursupersecretpassphrase\",\"coin\":\"KMD\"}"` in BarterDEX days... use the `wif` as custom seed in AtomicDEX

Today one of my coins was sent to another address and I received another coin for no reason. I didn't swap them or anything, both transactions are not related. But I made neither of both transactions. My wallet password and seed are both stored securely, no one has access to them, my wallet or my computer and I never gave anyone my password or my seed. I am not nor was I ever on an insecure/public network when I had my wallet open. I know there are a lot of scams going on currently, but no one ever contacted me or anything and I certainly didn't give out any information like I said. The transactions occurred right after I updated the wallet. I updated from inside the wallet, so I didn't download any scam software or anything. So basically, my question is, is it possible that the update caused some sort of a bug or so? Or is there any way my seed or password could have been compromised by AtomicDex itself? I don't care about the coins, really was only a few bucks, but I would feel safer if I knew what caused this.


[18-Mar-21 08:05 PM] cipi#4502
that sounds like you had a maker order active and someone filled the order

Would be interesting to knows if you have it in your swap history or not

But in this case you can create your wif / private key or whatever offline with a paperwallet, and then restore it only once in atomicdex - this way you will reduce the attack surface, however there is also another solution from https://wallet.nimiq.com/ which basically give your seed through an `image` and when you want to login to your wallet you use this image.

However the security of your computer should absolutely be your responsibility, if you have a good antivirus you will likely not be infected the way you explained it - Note that for sending funds out of atomicdex we now have 2FA with Native OS password manager, so a user to be able to stole your funds will need: Your seed and The password of your machine, if this both happens this is likely user responsibility.

This is rly not the priority atm, but i know we want to support hardware wallet as well.


[19-Mar-21 05:05 AM] Deleted_account#6986
I agree. Everyone is responsible for their own device. But to illustrate my thoughts, if you don't want someone to shoot himself in the foot, don't give him a gun. Many crypto users, specially during a raging bull run, are complete noob when it comes to technology, so if we can do anything to avoid them to screw up, we should do it.

So once again, having this input field in the first step is 100% unnecessary, it does not incentive the user to backup the seed properly (it's done at the second step) and offer potential attack vector.

So I would highly recommend to completely drop this...

===================================
And when it comes to restoring your private key, you're playing with fire on a Windows machine. I would never restore them on a Windows machine. Even with "antivirus" (lol) you're really really far from being safe.

@Slyris what if we just start a separate discord just for AtomicDEX? - for now, just add the link to the UI on mobile / desktop / and future web. Also add #dogedex, #SLP,  #ü§ù‚îÇgeneral-support, and slowly add channels for each coin?  @daemonfox, this could be eventually visually "hooked" directly to UI? ---- #AddTheChat

Hey all, 

I was wondering what the reasons were for the high Bitcoin tx fees on Atomic Dex vs. average btc fees. Anyone know? Probably something obvious that I am missing.


[19-Mar-21 02:35 PM] Chief Crypto#2529
Average fee is supposedly around $23, but the fee is $138 on Atomic Dex.


[19-Mar-21 02:36 PM] Chief Crypto#2529
It wants .0022 Btc for a .0078 btc transaction. Is this normal?

thanks. I was looking at the price for BLK in the DEX. It points to Coingecko, but sometimes the price is way off, because of price differences between exchange. So I was wonder if I it is possible to use only one exchange, instead of the coingecko calculated price


[21-Mar-21 06:40 AM] Slyris#2880
For the moment it's automatic @michelvankessel :

- Band Price Protocol
- If not available fallback to coingecko
- If coingecko not available price is 0

You get partially matched so the amount of your order decreased


[23-Mar-21 12:56 AM] Waldemar#9727
@Slyris so amount left != initial - swapped is normal?


[23-Mar-21 01:07 AM] VJ#1796
If you are buying 1000 Verus for 500 KMD and someone sells you 200 Verus, your order would be buy 800 Verus for 400KMD. @Waldemar


[23-Mar-21 01:12 AM] Waldemar#9727
so something strange happend beacause few days ago i've placed order for 1000 verus, someone swapped with me for 200 and 400 left in order (example numbers)


[23-Mar-21 01:13 AM] Waldemar#9727
hmm maybe some failed swaps?

is there a way to import pk into atomicdex?


[27-Mar-21 09:03 PM] cipi#4502
yes, "recover wallet" and use your private key as "custom seed"


[27-Mar-21 09:11 PM] dondada#8777
will i have to do them one by one? because i have like three.


[27-Mar-21 09:18 PM] cipi#4502
yes, each will be a separate wallet in ADEX... a "wallet" in ADEX only holds one pk/seed


[27-Mar-21 09:21 PM] dondada#8777
my pks are not from adex i have a pk that needs import.


[27-Mar-21 09:23 PM] cipi#4502
with private keys (WIF) i mean what you get when calling dumpprivkey
what coin is it?


[27-Mar-21 09:24 PM] dondada#8777
its a utxo shitcoin


[27-Mar-21 09:25 PM] cipi#4502
if it's supported on ADEX, you can use the WIF to create a new wallet on ADEX, each WIF is a new wallet
much easier: consolidate all funds into one address and use that in ADEX


[27-Mar-21 09:32 PM] dondada#8777
sorry for my ignorance but what is a WIF?


[27-Mar-21 09:35 PM] cipi#4502
WIF = private key = what you get when you call `bitcoin-cli dumpprivkey youaddress`


[27-Mar-21 09:46 PM] dondada#8777
where can i find a guide?

[31-Mar-21 07:16 AM] cipi#4502
if that happens it means it doesn't match because of other reasons... one matching criteria is price, the other is min_volume (if maker has set that) and there is also banning (after failed swaps, nodes ban each other)
what pair is it?

[31-Mar-21 07:29 AM] cipi#4502
you can't see it atm, only in CLI and Desktop version has added it, but not yet released

Yes, the Build-Instructions wiki page is out of date, 

Now running `cmake` will install all the vcpkg packages for you.

[05-Apr-21 08:40 AM] vlePa#5467
What I don't understand is the diff between 0x and ak_ addresses (when it comes to AE)


[05-Apr-21 08:41 AM] vlePa#5467
e.g. on various exchanges and AE wallet, i get a ak_ address
but as an ERC token, it's a 0x

very confusing


[05-Apr-21 09:13 AM] Slyris#2880
It's not confusing @vlePa , on AtomicDEX we use checksum address for ERC/BEP tokens, so you get the 0x prefix


[05-Apr-21 09:13 AM] Slyris#2880
You have the same approach here: https://explorer.harmony.one/#/


[05-Apr-21 09:36 AM] vlePa#5467
@Slyris Does that mean sending from ak_ to 0x is straightfoward or does it need some additional steps?


[05-Apr-21 10:24 AM] Slyris#2880
Usually sending from an ak wallet should propose both solution either checksum either ak

[06-Apr-21 03:54 PM] cipi#4502
needs to be added to ADEX-API first, AE has totally different API https://api-docs.aeternity.io, so i don't think it will happen so soon


[06-Apr-21 03:55 PM] vlePa#5467
That's ok. Just curious


[07-Apr-21 12:43 AM] Slyris#2880
I simplified build instructions for atomicdex desktop: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/wiki/Build-Instructions


[07-Apr-21 01:24 AM] jansako#3330
Suggestion: 
Can we filter out invalid 'dust' orders by default? e.g. currently there is a 'user' that left open a couple of orders across BTC/KMD/LTC pairs that cannot be filled because they are smaller than the minimum protocol order size. These orders are clogging up the https://dexstats.info/arbitrage.php, but also create confusion amongst any new users that will try to fill them for sure.

Possible solution:
- once an order becomes too small to be able to be filled, stop broadcasting it to the network
- either mark it on the user side (if they are using a UI), or better, just auto-cancel it & log/notify the user

Alternate: Implement a filter on the UI that would hide invalid orders but this would mess up any automated trading tools or price monitors


[07-Apr-21 01:26 AM] jansako#3330
Also a malicious actor could spam hundreds of these over time & make the orderbooks UI practically unusable. Happy to explain how but I am sure you can see it too.


[07-Apr-21 02:00 AM] Slyris#2880
It's already the case on last version @jansako

[07-Apr-21 02:49 AM] jansako#3330
@Slyris I know you already cannot 'fill' an order that is too small from the taker side, or directly make one from the maker side. My issue is that partially matched leftover orders like these have no business to be rebroadcast at all. Would it be too much of a performance hit to check if the order is 'valid' each time before it is rebroadcast? If it is, then the check should be made at the point when the order is partially filled. If the leftover amount is 'valid', keep the order live, otherwise cancel it.


[07-Apr-21 02:53 AM] Slyris#2880
How you are supposed to match this order if you cannot start the swap @jansako ?


[07-Apr-21 02:54 AM] Slyris#2880
If you want i can add an extra filtering that exclude this kind of order visually


[07-Apr-21 02:54 AM] Slyris#2880
But atm, you cannot start a swap on such an order since the volume < minimal_trading_amount


[07-Apr-21 02:55 AM] CHMEX#0686
I think what he means is do not display it on the gui

[07-Apr-21 02:56 AM] Slyris#2880
But i believe from what @artem.pikulin just explained in #dev-marketmaker those orders should automatically be cancelled


[07-Apr-21 02:56 AM] CHMEX#0686
Even better yes


[07-Apr-21 02:57 AM] CHMEX#0686
But also i would not only rely on the core canceling it


[07-Apr-21 02:57 AM] CHMEX#0686
If u know the protocol you can do funny things


[07-Apr-21 03:00 AM] jansako#3330
They are not being auto-cancelled now, is it because the person is running an old version?

there is one for LTC too


[07-Apr-21 03:01 AM] jansako#3330
I think it is a multi-order BTC/LTC/KMD


[07-Apr-21 03:02 AM] Slyris#2880

@jansako just speak with artem, it's seems that we will remove the limit of 0.00777 for some coins and this kind of order can still be matched, will let you know once everything is implemented


[07-Apr-21 03:08 AM] jansako#3330
Great, thanks! Seems the current issue is just someone on an old version which you can't really prevent... well you could implement a version filter so that only nodes running a 'rolling X versions back' are seen by any other nodes... sorry, getting into design mode a bit too much here... need to go back to my product testing now üôÇ

Which will drastically reduce some fees cost such as BTC Atomic Swaps.


[09-Apr-21 11:32 AM] Slyris#2880
There is also lot of questions about a fiat ramp with AtomicDEX in a decentralized fashion way.


[09-Apr-21 11:34 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
As decentralized as possible, banks can always freeze on their end. Kinda of like permissioned tokens/chains.


[09-Apr-21 11:35 AM] Slyris#2880
Sure @polycryptoblog - but keep in mind that we want to implement Atomic Swaps with fiat, so this also means that if any freeze are present by your bank Account, the HTLC contract will refund you.


[09-Apr-21 11:35 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Ah yes


[09-Apr-21 11:36 AM] Slyris#2880
But you are also right, this feature depends on your bank account which is a centralized service, but any fiat come from centralized endpoint at the end of the day.


[09-Apr-21 11:37 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I have looked at the tech,  it will be nice,  not sure what time frames the withdrawal will be. Will just have to keep an eye on their development and progress


[09-Apr-21 11:37 AM] Slyris#2880
The withdrawal it's instant but limited for legal reason


[09-Apr-21 11:37 AM] Slyris#2880
so it's likely 1000‚Ç¨ / month / public address


[09-Apr-21 11:38 AM] Slyris#2880
(without KYC)


[09-Apr-21 11:38 AM] Slyris#2880
According to their public telegram channel.


[09-Apr-21 11:38 AM] Slyris#2880
The withdraw is instantly after the AtomicSwap finished because this technology require SEPA Instant from your Bank


[09-Apr-21 11:38 AM] Slyris#2880
So if your bank support SEPA Instant deposit/withdrawal


[09-Apr-21 11:39 AM] Slyris#2880
You will get the money right away - but limited as mentionned above.


[09-Apr-21 11:40 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Typically sepa payments take a day to settle


[09-Apr-21 11:40 AM] Slyris#2880
Instant SEPA is instant, i have used them through my bank


[09-Apr-21 11:40 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Ah,  I don‚Äôt use sepa much so I don‚Äôt know


[09-Apr-21 11:41 AM] Slyris#2880
This kind of SEPA will not be supported by the technology because they are not instant so user will timeout the HTLC contract in this case


[09-Apr-21 11:41 AM] Slyris#2880
and be refunded


[09-Apr-21 11:41 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
This would be really good. But one big question


[09-Apr-21 11:41 AM] Slyris#2880
note that also don't work for non SEPA transfer, it's very new and limited.

Would they just send a 2nd sepa payment to a bank account for the dexfee


[09-Apr-21 11:42 AM] Slyris#2880
They collect the taker fee, it's their service


[09-Apr-21 11:43 AM] Slyris#2880
from what i've understand


[09-Apr-21 11:43 AM] Slyris#2880
@polycryptoblog https://fastspot.io/#/ there is one implementation of the OASIS API here

{Embed}
https://fastspot.io/
Fastspot: Atomic swap crypto and fiat.
The Fastspot API enables non-custodial, cross-chain and fiat-ready atomic swaps.
https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/NOCgShVEP4Mc8Owg03l0BTIGQGetgH8u_Cu4xlMRgX4/https/fastspot.io/social-media-image.png


[09-Apr-21 11:44 AM] Slyris#2880
We (in our future implementation) will play the role of Fastspot


[09-Apr-21 11:45 AM] Slyris#2880
There is a service fee percentage for sure according to the fastpots API but idk if it's for them or the TEN31 bank


[09-Apr-21 11:45 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
We will have to negotiate some revshare.


[09-Apr-21 11:46 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
But I think this could work really complementary to the ACO I keep yelling about


[09-Apr-21 11:47 AM] Slyris#2880
The thing is that for user that spend a small amount let's say `46‚Ç¨` the fees are like `0.000001‚Ç¨` network fee and `0.000001‚Ç¨` funding network fee and then `serviceFeePercentage` is `0.01‚Ç¨`


[09-Apr-21 11:47 AM] Slyris#2880
So i don't know which fee exactly is for the service (US) and how much is for the protocol (OASIS + TENBANK) (them)


[09-Apr-21 11:47 AM] Slyris#2880
I believe fastspot get their part too but i need to ask


[09-Apr-21 11:49 AM] Slyris#2880
The thing is i believe real bank have a minimum deposit through sepa transfer it's usually not possible to deposit < `0.01‚Ç¨` through a SEPA


[09-Apr-21 11:49 AM] Slyris#2880
so i dont rly know how this works in this specific case


[09-Apr-21 12:02 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes will have to find out the details


[10-Apr-21 08:19 AM] mess#0494
sorry for the noob question... does the program needs to stay opened while an order is open?

Yes has to be open

Hi I sent some SNT coin to my KOMODO wallet. Now I notice that I can not swap with any coin and I cannot even send my coin back to other address. What should I do? Can anyone help?


[10-Apr-21 09:06 AM] Slyris#2880
@smartercom Hey i can help you, you mean Status ERC20 ?


[10-Apr-21 09:06 AM] Slyris#2880
Because you don't own any ETH in your Komodo wallet i guess ?


[10-Apr-21 09:07 AM] Slyris#2880
GAS fees need to be paid on ETH for ERC20 tokens, if you send SNT to your KMD wallet and you don't own any ETH, you cannot send it back to your wallet.


[10-Apr-21 09:07 AM] smartercom#0723
@Slyris Thanks a lot! That's true.


[10-Apr-21 09:07 AM] Slyris#2880
This is a decentralized exchange


[10-Apr-21 09:08 AM] Slyris#2880
Note that in the application you can check your private key in the settings and import this priv key in your wallet that have ETH, and get them out of atomicdex without owning any ETH here


[10-Apr-21 09:12 AM] smartercom#0723
The ridiculously high gas fee scared me. So the wallet with ETH cannot be a wallet on an exchange, right?


[10-Apr-21 09:12 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah gas is high, may i suggest you to wait this night to avoid high gas fees on ETH ?


[10-Apr-21 09:12 AM] Slyris#2880
During the night it's more comfortable to withdraw


[10-Apr-21 09:13 AM] Slyris#2880
If i may suggest i'm also an holder of SNT, i rly suggest you to hold them, you can also wait L2 ETH, and have low fees then to withdraw, if this is urgent unfortunately you will need some ETH to withdraw your funds - this is not the responsibility of a decentralized wallet to achieve this task for you :/


[10-Apr-21 09:15 AM] smartercom#0723
It's not urgent so I will just hold for now. Thank you so much for your help!!


[10-Apr-21 09:15 AM] Slyris#2880
You are welcome @smartercom ! (and don't forget your keys - your coins)

Hi team, I am trying to withdraw BTC (bitcoin) from AtomicDex to my Ledger hardware wallet. It is using Native SegWit (bech32): addresses starting with bc1. According to your FAQ this is supported but I get a failed to send error message [{"error":"rpc:244] lp_coins:998] utxo_common:1314] utxo_common:233] Invalid Address"}] any ideas?


[10-Apr-21 10:29 PM] sam_22b#2007
And I have confirmed the address is correct


[10-Apr-21 10:38 PM] cipi#4502
segwit addresses are supported, but no bech32 with bc1... convert the bc1 address to legacy address format and withdraw to that


[10-Apr-21 10:49 PM] sam_22b#2007
Thanks! sending it to a legacy address worked. But it would be good if Bech32 was supported, especially because the FAQ says it is > https://support.atomicwallet.io/article/162-does-atomic-wallet-offer-support-for-segwit.

[11-Apr-21 08:59 AM] cipi#4502
btw, when you compile yourself or use builds with same version (eg 0.4.0), you need to reset asset config each time a new coin was added to ADEX, else you won't see it in "enable assets"


[11-Apr-21 09:00 AM] cipi#4502
same applies to the settings of this coins... still seeing some failed DOGE swaps because of dust... those are just because someone didn't reset his asset config and is still using outdated settings for DOGE


[11-Apr-21 09:24 AM] Slyris#2880
@mojo_jojo400 You need to reset your assets configuration

Sorry again if this is a dumb question... if I set an order to trade 10 KMD for 10 VRSC, in order for that order to be fulfilled, does it need to be another order buying 10 VRSC for 10 KMD? or could it be fulfilled incrementally, little by little, like in exchanges?


[11-Apr-21 10:36 AM] mess#0494
like for example, 10 orders buying 1 KMD for 1 VRSC


[11-Apr-21 10:50 AM] Sir Seven#7158
This one is true for maker orders.


[11-Apr-21 10:51 AM] mess#0494

it's probably similiar to binance smart chain requiring BNB for tx fees.
same with ETH.  send ERC20 token, requires ETH for tx fee.
do you have ETH in the wallet?

Can I generate a signed ETH message with my wallet since we own the keys?


[13-Apr-21 04:30 AM] gcharang#6833
the app doesn't have that functionality. you can export the privkey from atomicdex-desktop and import it to another wallet that supports signing arbitrary messages

If it is optional like BNB ok. But one of the biggest failures and annoyances in my opinion of other DEXs(in name only or otherwise) has been the requirement to own a token in order to use them

[15-Apr-21 07:03 PM] Mylo#8306
seems to be the acceptable way of doing things in crypto.
when "native" fees becomes the new awesome feature, can revert back - or make it an option.
but KMD fees are predictably low
it's foreseeable to see the KMD (& VRSC) ecosystems have multi-function chain services with predictably low fees
it's a great future


[15-Apr-21 07:06 PM] PTYX#6840
it would be optional but with benefits


[15-Apr-21 07:06 PM] PTYX#6840
as a trader you'd rather use KMD to save on fees

reverted back to the old version and none of my coin is there? but its the same seed and wallet and evetyhing


[16-Apr-21 07:24 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah, this is a timeout unfortunately - would you mind to share your mm2 logs with me ? you can find them through the settings and open log folder


[16-Apr-21 07:27 AM] Slyris#2880
When you revert a version that use the config of this specific version (reset cfg because your 0.4.0 became 0.4.1 but 0.4.1 didn't became 0.4.0, so 0.4.0 cfg got recreated, just re-enable your coins)

Hi all, I saw 0.4.1-beta was released. My hope was that VAL was added. If I check Github, I can see the pull was merged https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/commit/7d508eaffc914aedc4e9beb1133ccb878a4e658c  and is part of the 0.4.1-beta tag,  but when I download from the 0.4.1-beta tag, https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/releases/tag/0.4.1-beta ,  I don't see VAL in the coin list (Add Asset). Why is that?


[16-Apr-21 01:37 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
my assumption would be because the PR includes
```json
    "active": false,
    "currently_enabled": false```


[16-Apr-21 01:41 PM] michelvankessel#7656
Thanks, but that is true for other coins, but those are available.


[16-Apr-21 02:00 PM] lightspeed393#5403
you probably need to reset your coins in settings


[16-Apr-21 02:01 PM] lightspeed393#5403
`Reset Assets Configuration`


[16-Apr-21 02:03 PM] michelvankessel#7656
it was a clean install..new wallet


[16-Apr-21 02:06 PM] lightspeed393#5403
after looking closer, that PR was merged to dev branch 12 hours ago. The code for the release was merged to master 2 days ago, so it seems it missed the cut.


[16-Apr-21 02:08 PM] lightspeed393#5403
you'll have to wait for the next release or use a dev version build from github actions


[16-Apr-21 02:13 PM] michelvankessel#7656
but the code for release is tag 0.4.1-beta, which is commit 612690b and not master..it is part of the dev branch... I am confused with all those branches üôÇ


[16-Apr-21 02:14 PM] michelvankessel#7656
anyway... it is not there.. I checked commit 612690b source code, and I don't see the VAL coin parameters.. so we have to wait


[16-Apr-21 02:14 PM] michelvankessel#7656
thanks


[16-Apr-21 02:16 PM] lightspeed393#5403
I'm not sure about that release tag and commit for the release, but typically they merge dev to master and then do the release. You can see the PR from a couple days ago. Maybe the tag has something to do with dev branch being the default branch.


[16-Apr-21 02:18 PM] michelvankessel#7656
yeah..I think that is what confuses me


[16-Apr-21 02:28 PM] Slyris#2880

I'm not sure if atomicdex-desktop checks the checksum or something to verify the mm2 version, but switching it out might work

Question re. bep20 support for wallet and trade

will there be a possibility to stake CAKE/BUNNY etc as well in the future?

For example there is a Safepal wallet on appstore you can use to stake CAKE


[17-Apr-21 01:26 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But if something like that would be incorporated in atomicdex then you have a onestopshop for all bep20 coins as well and immediate bridge to UTXO/ETH tokens etc

It's not possible yet because we do not use the same derivation algorithm

[18-Apr-21 03:37 AM] Notworkingnewversion#0980
You need to clarify the public about the minimum orders. Nothing works. Previously, I exchanged the minimum amounts only was not less than 0.00777 or 0.0777 I do not remember. Now I can not set anything at all. It does not allow to put an order.


[18-Apr-21 03:40 AM] Notworkingnewversion#0980
I do not know why developers think that if they do as much of these flash effects, it will be better.


[18-Apr-21 03:43 AM] Notworkingnewversion#0980

[18-Apr-21 05:24 AM] Notworkingnewversion#0980
People come to watch liquidity and prices and compare prices with centralized stock exchanges, and the program writes  no funds. But in the old version it worked, why delete this feature.

Perhaps in the new version you need to make a notification that the time must be synchronized on your system.

Hello Team! whom can I speak to regarding API dev?


[18-Apr-21 07:49 AM] jansako#3330
I second the comment about the open orders being in a terrible spot. The separate tab with them was nice in the previous version. Maybe you did not consider that any semi-active user can/will have tens of open orders, searching through them in that little tab is a pain.

If the order list is to be permanently displayed, then please improve the filtering
- by default only show the orders from the active pair
- allow persistent filters & a 'reset to default'

This would allow the users to see all orders if they want to , but not clutter the UI with dozens or hundreds of orders.


[18-Apr-21 07:52 AM] jansako#3330
If your inspiration for this was WavesDex, even there it only works with small amount of orders. And orders on WavesDex auto-cancel after 30 days. In AtomicDex I had some up much longer than that. I superbly dislike an order auto-cancelling without my say-so...

[18-Apr-21 07:55 AM] jansako#3330
pro view with 300+ orders on the list is... not so helpful...
with a good filter it would be more so.

You rly have 300 orders up ?


[18-Apr-21 07:55 AM] jansako#3330

[18-Apr-21 07:55 AM] jansako#3330
no but try just 30


[18-Apr-21 07:56 AM] jansako#3330
really just 5-6 ordes across all possible pairs

[18-Apr-21 07:57 AM] jansako#3330
nah, I am all about making a sensible choice for the user. seeing tons of orders by default does not feel like it. Having a choice to enable to ability to see them all is more so

if we want serious traders on AtomicDEX, we should expect users with 300+ orders at some point or another


[18-Apr-21 08:12 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
yes, especially given that there's 270 coins in coins.json now


[18-Apr-21 08:14 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
sell 10% at price x
sell 20% at price y
buy 4% at price w
etc
over a few dozen coins adds up

This latest release is nicer UI wise but I think it's a bit buggier then the previous releases


[18-Apr-21 09:06 PM] smkhound#7640
hi @feri - it might be due to a large number of utxos, this happens sometimes if mining or lots of small transactions sent to address.
Try consolidating utxos by sending a smaller amount to yourself like half balance then increase and repeat until there's less utxos


[18-Apr-21 10:08 PM] smkhound#7640
pls DM me with address to confirm this is the case

[19-Apr-21 10:06 AM] ejuliano#8606
does atomicDEX support the TRC20 USDT ?


[19-Apr-21 10:08 AM] lightspeed393#5403
no TRC-20's are not on atomicDEX. At the moment there's ERC-20, BEP-20, and QRC-20 tokens.


[19-Apr-21 10:09 AM] ejuliano#8606
oh yes there is BUSD, i should look into that one - is that the Binance version of USDT or is it their own usd stablecoin?


[19-Apr-21 10:09 AM] cipi#4502
BUSD is Binance USD, on BEP20 and ERC20


[19-Apr-21 10:10 AM] cipi#4502
USDT (Tether) is on BEP20, different coin

You can have a look at my comment on github:
<https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/897>
There was an unofficial discussion in #french about it


[19-Apr-21 12:10 PM] rionnox#3470
Thanks üòÅ. I was just reading about the lightning network and aware it carrys risks. Perhaps when they eradicate this it'll be worth considering üôèüòé


[19-Apr-21 12:13 PM] phm87#7395
Indeed, it includes more risks than just hodling coins onchain. Same applies to smart contracts, more layers more risks. Nowadays, risk can be mitigated on LN if you use proper backup system and you have watchtower service.
FYI, #chips (a project of jl777, sg777 and kmd community) is using a restricted version of LN

Hey guys - where does atomicdex for linux store it's settings? I changed the setting for font rendering and now it crashes immidiately after opening and I have no access to my wallet xD

[19-Apr-21 01:40 PM] RandiMcRandom#3232
Any reason why I am getting an invalid address for xrp when I try to trade it on ChangeNow?


[19-Apr-21 01:41 PM] RandiMcRandom#3232
I‚Äôve tried the copy paste address from my pc and then tried it on my phone and scanned my QR and it said the same issue


[19-Apr-21 01:42 PM] RandiMcRandom#3232
Says. Please enter a valid address or FIO name. I‚Äôd post the pic but it won‚Äôt let me. I‚Äôve checked it multiple times and even scanned it. Can‚Äôt figure the issue. Only work around would be to go to another coin atm? Because I don‚Äôt have any bnb


[19-Apr-21 01:42 PM] cipi#4502
look in `~/.atomic_qt/`... one of the files there


[19-Apr-21 01:43 PM] cipi#4502
the XRP on AtomicDEX are the BEP20 ones, on the BSC chain, Binance Smart Chain

he's trying to send to an atomicDEX BNB address and it's saying the address as invalid


[19-Apr-21 01:44 PM] RandiMcRandom#3232
I just don‚Äôt want to get to the atm and then have my QR code and/or address invalid


[19-Apr-21 01:44 PM] RandiMcRandom#3232
If I can‚Äôt figure out a way to exchange without BNB


[19-Apr-21 01:45 PM] cipi#4502
it likely needs to be the mixed case address, not the single case one


[19-Apr-21 01:45 PM] cipi#4502
if you want to swap BEP20 tokens on AtomicDEX, you need BNB in your address


[19-Apr-21 01:46 PM] lightspeed393#5403
what's this one? 0x293aC0aC8F443c59Dc08264dB191F2FED856e3f1


[19-Apr-21 01:46 PM] RandiMcRandom#3232
Oh ok I don‚Äôt really know the difference between mixed/single. Still newer. But yeah I don‚Äôt have BNB, but I want some and some xrp. So do you think my qr would still work at an atm?


[19-Apr-21 01:47 PM] cipi#4502
mixed case... looks good


[19-Apr-21 01:47 PM] RandiMcRandom#3232
I know I need BNB to get xrp. I only have lite/eth/doge/kmd


[19-Apr-21 01:48 PM] lightspeed393#5403
well I just tested that address for what @RandiMcRandom is trying to do and it says invalid address. Just trying to figure out if that's changenow giving an error or if it's atomicdex giving the wrong format of the address


[19-Apr-21 01:48 PM] cipi#4502
look at the address in URL and the one shown on page...

are you guys sure that 0x293aC0aC8F443c59Dc08264dB191F2FED856e3f1 is an address on the BSC chain? BEP20


[19-Apr-21 01:51 PM] lightspeed393#5403
no i'm not sure, that's what I'm trying to figure out. It's the address AtomicDEX gives me for receiving BNB.


[19-Apr-21 01:52 PM] cipi#4502
then it must be correct üôÇ
it is BNB on the  BSC chain (BEP20)... BNB is also on Binance Chain (BEP2)


[19-Apr-21 01:52 PM] lightspeed393#5403
I have no experience with BNB so I'm not sure what the correct address format is. I just know it's not working for receiving from changenow. whether that's their problem or atomicdex's is what I'm trying to get to the bottom ofc


[19-Apr-21 01:52 PM] MaJoRa#9564
Amazing, thank you! Found the config and reset it but the app is still dead, guess I'll be clearing it all in favour of just setting it up again with my seed. Thanks anyway.


[19-Apr-21 01:53 PM] RandiMcRandom#3232
So is it possible I just ran into a bug with the new desktop changes?


[19-Apr-21 01:54 PM] cipi#4502
could be that ChangeNow uses the BEP2 BNB, not the BEP20 BNB from AtomicDEX... need to find out on which chain ChangeNow operates


[19-Apr-21 01:55 PM] lightspeed393#5403
yea that's probably it. It just says `Binance Coin Mainnet` so I guess BEP2 one?


[19-Apr-21 01:55 PM] cipi#4502
i guess that's BEP2, yes


[19-Apr-21 01:56 PM] cipi#4502
this is how Binance shows it... you can choose on which chain you want your coins... BEP20 is what AtomicDEX supports atm

[19-Apr-21 02:18 PM] cipi#4502
looked through my bookmarks of instant exchanges and they all offer only BNB on BEP2...
strangely enough, CoinEX supports BNB... only on BEP20... lol... at least another possibility to get BEP20 BNB without a Binance account

wait, there is another... on Binance Bridge... but not for all coins: https://binance-wallet.gitbook.io/binance-bridge/guides/buy-bnb-as-gas
you can buy some BNB on BSC in the same operation as converting some USDT TRX20 to USDT BEP20, eg


[19-Apr-21 02:25 PM] cipi#4502
lol, seems it's disabled for all coins atm: https://api.binance.org/bridge/api/v2/tokens

we were talking about some changes to the desktop/online app in the general trading channel


[20-Apr-21 08:36 AM] RandiMcRandom#3232
they said to bring it here with some feedback so ill just cut and paste some of it


[20-Apr-21 08:36 AM] RandiMcRandom#3232
all i know is im sure everyone in this discord wants atomicdex and komodo to grow. when i talk about coin or atomicdex at a poker game/at work/shooting club/online gaming/etc... and then when i try to show them how to get atomicdex and start trading. its an entire process that once they get to the second screen of "More Info" drop downs and "Keep possible malicious software" and so on.. it just straight up discourgaes them
thats my main point about all of it
im 3 weeks-a month into coin so im just speaking from a 'newcomer trying to use atomicdex/coin atms/etc'
trying to get away from coinbase and my name/checking accounts and more into a decentralized seed type of account, just like atomicdex offered me
the app itself is great and pretty easy to understand once u mess with the rick and morty coins, but just getting to that stage in the 'lifecycle' takes forever


[20-Apr-21 08:44 AM] RandiMcRandom#3232
so if KMD gets to point where it can get into ATMs that has been the most interesting thing ive found is really just how bad some of them try to screw you


[20-Apr-21 08:50 AM] actionslacks#4072
unfortunately most people are locked into the walled garden/triopoly of apple/google/microsoft. No crypto apps can get past those install warnings without offering user info up to the technocracy.


[20-Apr-21 08:55 AM] RandiMcRandom#3232
there was a lot more to it than that. just simply getting to the download. then getting to the geoblocked. just getting the download on github


[20-Apr-21 08:55 AM] RandiMcRandom#3232
all of those things add up


[20-Apr-21 08:56 AM] actionslacks#4072
yeah the geoblock is a bitch. marmara chain hosts a fork without it but idk if they're on the latest version yet


[20-Apr-21 08:57 AM] actionslacks#4072
dogedex would probably be the easiest option for noobs in the states since it's an app.


[20-Apr-21 08:57 AM] actionslacks#4072
and there's no geoblock


[20-Apr-21 08:58 AM] actionslacks#4072

it is possible. but not enabled for now.  a limited set of well tested and essential ones might be activated in the future if necessary. it is a big **might**. it could be that we will never have ccs on the kmd chain utself

[20-Apr-21 05:35 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
so I'd have to assume it's not the call itself that's the issue


[20-Apr-21 05:36 PM] cipi#4502
i guess it's another call, something like this
`[info] [coingecko.cpp:171] [1166036]: url: https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/monacoin/market_chart?vs_currency=usd&days=7&interval=daily`
and since i have set the chart to 7 days, i assume it is this call... and that is a separate one for each enabled coin with a geckoid


[20-Apr-21 05:40 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
near as I can tell, all 39 calls in log over the last 72 mins is the same as above


[20-Apr-21 09:57 PM] Slyris#2880
you seems to reach coingecko api rate limit @ComputerGenie :/

Rate limit for the CoinGecko API is 10 calls each second per Internet Protocol (‚ÄúIP‚Äù) address, although such rate limit may be varied by CoinGecko at any time in its sole discretion without notice or reference to you or any Users.
```


[20-Apr-21 10:09 PM] Slyris#2880
So i checked a bit with 6 coins enabled that have a currency balance i don't it such a problem and the chart load immediatly


[20-Apr-21 10:19 PM] Slyris#2880
When we reach the gecko limit, we wait 1 second and reprocess the rpc call, note that if coingecko want, they can ban your IP and forbid rpc call for a longer time


[20-Apr-21 10:46 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
seems like there should be a different way to go to not break the app at some 3rd party's random discretion, no?


[20-Apr-21 10:56 PM] Slyris#2880
well we need this kind of data from adex api yes, so in the future we will likely not use coingecko for such a things - on the other hand idk how much coin have a fiat balance for you, but if you have less than 10 it's should load almost instantly for you


[20-Apr-21 10:59 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
imho, a trading app that has a "Pro-Mode" should expect that a not insignificant number of users would have a larger than 10 portfolio diversification


[20-Apr-21 11:01 PM] Slyris#2880
Even if you have undreads of assets that have value technically you can go:

10req  / s = 10 assets/s if you wait one seconds between each rate limit you should get your result in 10seconds, i don't really know what you expect here, it's an experimental feature to offer charts for the users, but we know that we need to have our own aggregator in adex api - still a beta for the moment, so we are here for beta testing things


[20-Apr-21 11:02 PM] Slyris#2880
btw 10 seconds is almost nothing if you compared to the portfolio of coinmarketcap it can takes 4-5 minute to reload your charts


[20-Apr-21 11:04 PM] Slyris#2880
ofc one of the solution would be to have a centralized database and store everything to have instant load etc, but this is not possible, we are 100% decentralized so we will likely not go for this solution, so we are stuck with 2 solutions:

- using public api such as coingecko
- implementing an aggregator in adex api and use it in all adex products


[20-Apr-21 11:06 PM] jspook16#3059
Maybe a "loading" message?


[20-Apr-21 11:06 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
> i don't really know what you expect here
fek me, you really don't respond well to critiques
perhaps you should leave that bit to someone else?
What I "expect" is 2/3rd of my screen (or that of any real user that anyone would consider "pro") to not be taken up with a chart that will never load.
This seems like quite a reasonable expectation to me.


[20-Apr-21 11:07 PM] Slyris#2880
Yes sure we can add a loading message, and there is already a spinner


[20-Apr-21 11:08 PM] Slyris#2880
I will be sure to have this charts and pie optional for the next version, and disabled by default in this case. if this was your initial wish, then express it clearly


[20-Apr-21 11:08 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
my "initial wish" is to have it load


[20-Apr-21 11:09 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
I felt I expressed that clearly


[20-Apr-21 11:09 PM] jspook16#3059
What's the issue? That it won't load or that it takes too long to load?


[20-Apr-21 11:09 PM] Slyris#2880
Then let's check together why in your specific case it doesn't load, have you tried that with initial configuration, aka only btc/kmd enabled ? just out of curiosity


[20-Apr-21 11:09 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
it will never load


[20-Apr-21 11:10 PM] Slyris#2880
This maybe a different issue which is not related to coingecko in this case, let's try to investigate then


[20-Apr-21 11:10 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
yes, with a few coins it will load
seems with more than 10 it will not


[20-Apr-21 11:11 PM] jspook16#3059
Oh. I haven't seen that yet or haven't noticed it


[20-Apr-21 11:11 PM] Slyris#2880
I see, and you say more than 10, it's more than 10 with fiat value ?


[20-Apr-21 11:12 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
7 have USD price


[20-Apr-21 11:12 PM] Slyris#2880
Did you caught by any chance an electrum error when enabling coins ?


[20-Apr-21 11:12 PM] Slyris#2880
One of the condition for the chart to load is that the number of activated coins need to be equal to the coins that are enabled


[20-Apr-21 11:13 PM] Slyris#2880
Can you check in your logs: `active_coins: ` and paste me the answer ?


[20-Apr-21 11:14 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
yes, it has an issue with BOTS


[20-Apr-21 11:14 PM] Slyris#2880
Is your number of active coins != enabled coins in this particular case ?


[20-Apr-21 11:15 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
active_coins: 31 coins_size: 30


[20-Apr-21 11:17 PM] Slyris#2880
Yes then that's why your chart never load :/ sorry for the inconvenience but this is a security, will be sure to have a new field in the next version for only fiat coins, but we didn't had enough time to make it for 0.4.2, there is my suggestion for a quick fix:

- Reset asset cfg
- Enable everything expects BOTS


Regarding BOTS error, is that from the electrum ? if this case, @cipi would you mind to check it ?


[20-Apr-21 11:18 PM] ComputerGenie#7004

Please check your internet connection (e.g. VPN service or firewall might block it).

[20-Apr-21 11:19 PM] Slyris#2880
Please confirm that your charts load after that manipulation, then we can fix the electrum problem


[20-Apr-21 11:24 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
yes, with a complete reset and readd of chains (except BOTS) it loads


[20-Apr-21 11:25 PM] Slyris#2880
ok great, we will check what's going on with BOTS electrum shortly, thanks for your feedback

Next version i will change the aggressive checks for the charts, i need to find a way to ensure the first load of the chart only when all expected coins are enabled, when you have a failure it make the things more complex unfortunately


[20-Apr-21 11:28 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
the added problem with that is that there's no way to disable such an issue without resetting and then readding a slew of coins
perhaps it needs a way to ignore coins it disables or has a spot for users to remove just the disabled and restart the app?


[20-Apr-21 11:29 PM] Slyris#2880
well i believe BOTS is wallet only now on top of that, we can maybe play with coins that have a coingecko id only

Would there be any significant drawbacks to Komodo hosting it's own API server that acts as a passthrough for these types of requests, or all requests from AtomicDEX? For example, hosting it's own API server would allow Komodo to cache results and avoid hitting rate limits so AtomicDEX can scale a bit easier. It would also be helpful to add backup sources within the API, could fetch prices from Coingecko and if there's an issue with Coingecko it just uses a cached price (with "price as of N" indicator) and fallback could be coinpaprika or cmc. 

That way you don't have to change the endpoint within the app, you just keep it consistent with the Komodo API, and change the sources that the Komodo API grabs from.


[21-Apr-21 06:02 AM] Regnar#6164
might be a bit slower since it would be a passthrough API, but considering the IP limits CG is hitting, it's probably still fast enough not to notice. Also it would be a bit more resistant to upstream API changes that break features of the app (like an endpoint deciding it needs an API key, or rate limits decrease) if there's upstream issues you can change the Komodo API sources and leave the endpoints the same, which could fix issues on the fly without having to download a "fixed" app


[21-Apr-21 06:04 AM] Regnar#6164
Aside from those points, (not sure if this is a positive or not, depends who you ask) but having a Komodo API could also provide better analytics of the userbase. Reality is someone, whether it is coingecko or Komodo, is receiving API requests from clients including IP addresses and some header info, at least with the latter it could be argued it's better for privacy since we have control over what to do with that data.


[21-Apr-21 06:08 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
> but considering the IP limits CG is hitting
the problem I was having isn't from the API, but rather that if an enabled coin fails to connect then it never tries

could it be related to this https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/913 ?

if the problem shows up mostly on Tuesdays then it is related

question is this wallet using z address of komodo and rewards system


[21-Apr-21 07:07 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
my best guess is that it was something carried from older configs from version to version to version
it was happening every run, but once config was reset I can't duplicate it


[21-Apr-21 07:38 AM] lightspeed393#5403

It was weird. It was showing my bch balance as $100, but when I would enter swap info, it would only let me go up to $45 because my previous trade that was in a loop was for $65... so now that 65 should be back and I can swap the full 100$


[22-Apr-21 06:40 AM] RandiMcRandom#3232
I‚Äôm hoping and assuming, but I will check back when I log on this morning


[22-Apr-21 07:50 AM] RandiMcRandom#3232
Yeah. logged in and the swap has been going for 12 hours now...


[22-Apr-21 07:51 AM] RandiMcRandom#3232
what the hell do i do with that


[22-Apr-21 07:51 AM] RandiMcRandom#3232
BCH for KMD 11 hrs 45 mins


[22-Apr-21 07:54 AM] RandiMcRandom#3232
dodgedex not responding and the app closed... is there a steady version i can use like before the pie chart and all of that was added? ive had nothing but issues since then


[22-Apr-21 07:54 AM] RandiMcRandom#3232
basically asking does it hurt to revert back to an older version that is like 3 versions ago?


[22-Apr-21 07:59 AM] RandiMcRandom#3232
either way i guess  im gonna take a few days off and wait till everything is fixed, gets too aggravating after a while

Yes it's absolutely normal, you had a previous trade that was not finished yet, so those funds were not accessible and used for the swap.

> what the hell do i do with that
> BCH for KMD 11 hrs 45 mins

You likely start a swap yesterday BCH<->KMD, unfortunately your transaction got likely stuck in the mempool (BTC notarization) and your swap is stuck for ever, as @cipi mentionned you above, we switch to LTC for notarization today, so this kind of problem should not happened again.

> dodgedex not responding and the app closed... is there a steady version i can use like before the pie chart and all of that was added?
Please send your logs of the crash, if you don't know where to find them you can open the logs folder through the settings and send  the log to @smkhound  that was corresponding to the crash session.

I'm sorry for the bad experience, it's still a beta product, let's check together and make few iterations to make your experience smoother !


[22-Apr-21 08:11 AM] smkhound#7640
yah, pls DM me any logs and what is OS etc so I can try and replicate


[22-Apr-21 08:23 AM] RandiMcRandom#3232
ok thank you for responding and helping. Do you want all of these logs in the folder? Theres over 20... and yes i want to make it the best experience it can be as well. It goes back to what some of us were talking about a few days ago in another thread about the ease of use/getting new users involved. I talk about coin/atomicDEX (now i will say dogedex to hopefully get their ears perked) but going through the process has been difficult. Removing the geoblocker, having a download directly thru a website and not marmar are great moves!


[22-Apr-21 08:24 AM] RandiMcRandom#3232
i want more people on there because  i love swapping, so i want the same thing. just sharing how frustrating it can be for someone whos been messing with it for about a month, and then try to see the frustration i would feel if i was brand new


[22-Apr-21 08:27 AM] Slyris#2880
We are here together to make the product more usable and sustainable for everyone don't worry, your feedback are welcome

same for dogedex, this will take some time for them to iterate, and it's their first version let's be realistic

is there a tutorial video on how to install from github to new windows client?


[22-Apr-21 09:14 AM] Slyris#2880
Hey - unfortunately due to DLL problems from Qt installer we had to remove the windows installer - however my personnal advice would be to download https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/releases/download/0.4.2-beta/atomicdex-desktop-0.4.2-beta-windows.zip

Then you can create a folder AtomicDEX in your Desktop, unzip the archive inside, right click on the atomicdex binary and create a shortcut - after that you will be able to start atomicdex from the windows search bar

so i started the app up, and it gave me the; WinHttpReceiveResponse: 12002: The operation timed out
error... so i restarted and it loaded up fine. i went to trade BCH for KMD and i selected custom protection settings (to de-select dPow).. the trade is working as it took my BCH fee, but when i go to Orders there is nothing there


[22-Apr-21 12:08 PM] RandiMcRandom#3232
I can't find the order anywhere, I've left it open on the page and its not there.. is it a load issue like the fetching transactions? hopefully its not the same thing as last night where i just lose the fee and the trade never goes thru, but i have no idea what im doing wrong

I don't know if you are trolling me, but i try to re-explain it, at the end of the page in the FAQ within AtomicDEX desktop you have a `Compliance Info` and you have every informations inside !

on AtomicDEX-Desktop 0.4.2 when I deposit BEP20-KMD, in tx details of history, the "Fees" unit is KMD but it is wrong since it was paid in BNB, amount is correct but one digit missing:

First thing is get the core changes merged over which will probably happen the same time as new notaries are implemented.  Then guis will need made/adapted .  End of summer/fall is more likely.

There's a Qt bug with windows installer bundling, awaiting resolution. In the meantime the portable version works fine on windows, just download https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/releases/download/0.4.2-beta/atomicdex-desktop-0.4.2-beta-windows.zip
unzip, and run `atomicdex-desktop.exe`

Hello, I cannot send BTC or LTC from my atomic dex wallet. I have tried 4 different addresses with BTC and 1 with LTC and all have failed. I was able to send KMD with no issues, however.


[23-Apr-21 10:22 AM] Slyris#2880
Hey which format of address did you send to ?


[23-Apr-21 10:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
one was to my crex account, two were to my ledger which use native segwit i believe and i also reluctantly tried my coinbase account and all failed and that was for BTC


[23-Apr-21 10:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
@Slyris i apologize i forgot to address you with that

hello?

We do not support segwit yet unfortunately


[23-Apr-21 11:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
i do not know what crex or coinbase uses


[23-Apr-21 11:39 AM] cipi#4502
but withdrawals to segwit addresses should work anyway... for the coins that have it set in the config... LTC has it set https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins/blob/master/coins#L1645 and i have sent a lot of LTC to such addresses
what isn't supported is bech32 address format
how does address looks like? what error do you get?


[23-Apr-21 11:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
hang on ill show you the error message

crex... let me look... i have sent lots of LTC to crex24


[23-Apr-21 11:41 AM] cipi#4502
yes, crex24 uses segwit addresses for LTC, they start with `M`... the normal ones start with `L`
but i can send LTC to `M`-addresses

i just installed it about 2 or 3 weeks ago and have not updated it because i dont know how


[23-Apr-21 11:44 AM] cipi#4502
how does BTC address you want to send to start with? can you show me the first 2 letters?
2-3 weeks is ok related to what i thought (coins config could be outdated, but segwit addresses are supported since a long time)


[23-Apr-21 11:45 AM] Deleted User#0000
bc


[23-Apr-21 11:47 AM] cipi#4502
aha, those are the ones in bech32 format, those are not supported
but you can "convert" that bc-address to a normal one by using block explorer
if you enter your bc-address in https://blockchair.com/bitcoin, it should show you somewhere how the old address format looks like and then you can use that address to send your BTC to
but be careful with the txfees, they are high atm


[23-Apr-21 11:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
ok i copied what you just typed and will get around to that i guess at some point. i wish i wouldve known all of this before putting those coins in the wallet. thank you and i appreciate your time


[23-Apr-21 11:51 AM] cipi#4502
sorry for the trouble
bech32 address format support is in the making, along with full segwit support
you can use that workaround till it's done
let me know if something is unclear

i have a trezor one as well, btw


[23-Apr-21 12:05 PM] cipi#4502
forget that link üôÇ ... it was just to show you that things are progressing fast
sending LTC from AtomicDEX to Ledger? it depends what address format Ledger uses for LTC, if it's also bech32 (addresses start with `lc` i guess), than you would need the workaround with the explorer to send


[23-Apr-21 12:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
no it's also segwit


[23-Apr-21 12:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
ill try my trezor though. i dont use it because i prefer the ledger but ill give it a go


[23-Apr-21 12:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
segwit on trezor as well. any idea when that update will be completed?


[23-Apr-21 12:08 PM] cipi#4502
there is segwit and there is bech32... if it's only segwit, it's ok, if it's bech32 it needs the workaround
in LTC the segwit addresses start with `M`, the bech32 ones with `lc` and the normal ones with `L`


[23-Apr-21 12:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
just a general timeframe

[23-Apr-21 12:10 PM] cipi#4502
no idea, but to me, as a non-developer like you it looks like it will not take long
but AtomicDEX Desktop will need to make a new release that has those changes integrated
as soon as it's out (added to ADEX-API) i will make you a build to test if you want

@Slyris


[23-Apr-21 03:48 PM] cipi#4502
you need BNB to do swaps with BEP20, same with ETH and ERC20 and QTUM and QRC20


[23-Apr-21 03:50 PM] daemonfox#6136
Yeah but I didn't need eth to buy eth lol...


[23-Apr-21 03:52 PM] cipi#4502
you need ETH to buy ETH... without ETH in balance, you can't claim the ETH payment sent by other side, it costs txfees to do that and they are paid in ETH ... same with BNB


[23-Apr-21 04:20 PM] cipi#4502
the bug with the min_volume seems related to DOGE base pair... on KMD base it's correct, if i move the volume slider, the message with min_volume shows up on correct volume... why not with DOGE? strange...

[23-Apr-21 06:00 PM] sabbycon#2304
Just downloaded the atomicdex beta, WOWZERS!


[23-Apr-21 06:00 PM] sabbycon#2304
But, I can't seem to find the all popular "ARRR"


[23-Apr-21 06:00 PM] sabbycon#2304
anyone able to fill me in


[23-Apr-21 06:06 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
It won‚Äôt be in for awhile,  probably towards end of year


[23-Apr-21 08:16 PM] daemonfox#6136
Im not following the BNB in the DEX...


[23-Apr-21 08:16 PM] daemonfox#6136
I added BNB, and it gives me an ETH like address but isnt that the BEP2 address?


[23-Apr-21 08:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
ETH and ETH-BEP20 give me the same address


[23-Apr-21 08:26 PM] lightspeed393#5403
it's a BNB BEP-20 address


[23-Apr-21 08:26 PM] lightspeed393#5403
I went through this the other day and was confused


[23-Apr-21 08:31 PM] daemonfox#6136
OK, do we have a better way to get BNB into aDEX?


[23-Apr-21 08:31 PM] daemonfox#6136
Or were we all expected to know this lol?


[23-Apr-21 08:36 PM] lightspeed393#5403
idk dude, it was my first time using bnb so I was confused as hell. And pretty much all the instant exchanges to get BNB send to a BEP2 address, so they all kept saying incorrect address.


[23-Apr-21 08:36 PM] lightspeed393#5403
I think the easiest way to get it there would be to buy BNB on binance and then when withdrawing select the BEP-20 form instead of BEP2 form

@Slyris hi, can I share my wallet json with you here?


[23-Apr-21 11:34 PM] Slyris#2880
ETH fees a bit more acceptable, we can expect more ERC20 trade it seems


[24-Apr-21 02:20 AM] Slyris#2880
@ad.astra have a question for you  @PTYX

Hey, who runs Atomic Dex? Or is in charge of adding assets?


[24-Apr-21 09:00 AM] Satoshi#3333
Is there a PR process?

Looks like that is where electrums would be added? I can PR if possible, want to get Denarius (D) on your AtomicDEX, was one of the first using and helping test BarterDEX back in the day


[24-Apr-21 09:06 AM] cipi#4502
before the coin can be added/PRed to ADEX Desktop, it needs an entry in the coins file, so it first needs a PR there, like this one: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins/pull/174/files
please do a test swap first to ensure it is working


[24-Apr-21 09:07 AM] Satoshi#3333
Yes swaps work, not sure if you remember me, I threw a big fit back in the day XD bahaha hopefully can put past behind us and yes I can get a PR up


[24-Apr-21 09:07 AM] Satoshi#3333
We have four electrumx servers online 24/7 tls supported


[24-Apr-21 09:08 AM] Satoshi#3333
CLTV is integrated into D so no worries there either, any special configuration for a PoS coin? Since tx creation/signing requires time data


[24-Apr-21 09:10 AM] cipi#4502
this was my last known config
```
        {
                "coin": "D",
                "name": "denarius",
                "fname": "Denarius",
                "rpcport": 32369,
                "isPoS": 1,
                "pubtype": 30,
                "p2shtype": 90,
                "wiftype": 158,
                "txfee": 10000,
                "protocol": {
                        "type": "UTXO"
                }
        },
```
it is missing some params though, like number of confirmations, and block time
need to think about/check the txfee too... best would be if coin daemon supports `estimatesmartfee 1`, then you can set txfee to 0... if not, you need to find out sane values for the fixed fee


[24-Apr-21 09:11 AM] cipi#4502
```
                "segwit": true,
                "mm2": 1,
```
other possible params... mm2:1 is actually needed
see the list of possible params here: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins#bitcoin-protocol-specific-json


[24-Apr-21 09:14 AM] Satoshi#3333
Okay great


[24-Apr-21 09:14 AM] Satoshi#3333
Perfect yea I will add it later today cipi


[24-Apr-21 09:28 AM] Slyris#2880
this should be fixed in dev branch now

there is 2FA already present, but no way to enable it through the GUI yet


[24-Apr-21 11:05 AM] blackpanther222#0398
ah ok..it would be nice to also activated it in gui...maybe in next release?  or am i the only one who need it?


[24-Apr-21 11:05 AM] Slyris#2880
It's was planned... we just forget to add the button in the GUI :3

Hey guys. I updated my working AtomicDex-Desktop on MacOS and now it only shows "No Connection" when I start the App. How can i fix that?


[24-Apr-21 12:46 PM] ! zpool.ca | crackers#9719
I think there must be problems with the electrum servers.... Versus Desktop app won't load any of the lite mode assets either...


[24-Apr-21 12:48 PM] Ugchen#5960
Hmmm... I started the app before update and it worked quite normal. After update only "No Connection" and a 60 seconds Counter for retry


[24-Apr-21 01:10 PM] Slyris#2880
@Roger hit the same problem - @smkhound can you take a look when you have some time ?

Maybe there was a change in a config file and we have to edit it by hand?

@cipi are electrum servers running ok? All my assets in Versus Desktop won't show, been trying for a few days now...

Someone from Team Komodo had told me I needed to download it but I didn't get the downloader link


[25-Apr-21 06:11 AM] Biscuits#0462
I'm using the latest desktop version windows release?


[25-Apr-21 06:11 AM] Biscuits#0462
I can probably use the cli if I get instructions


[25-Apr-21 06:11 AM] Biscuits#0462
But is there a Komodo app for doing it?


[25-Apr-21 06:12 AM] smkhound#7640
in AtomicDEX app is easy enough go to settings > security, you can see wif / seed


[25-Apr-21 06:12 AM] Biscuits#0462
For all the addresses/tokens?

[26-Apr-21 04:35 AM] blackpanther222#0398
Yeah i know but usdt is the most used stablecoin and most pairs were in usdt


[26-Apr-21 04:35 AM] blackpanther222#0398
For example arrr/usdt on coinex


[26-Apr-21 04:35 AM] Cryptoon#3362
problem with usdt is that it's very expensive because of high gas fees


[26-Apr-21 04:36 AM] Cryptoon#3362
and there was something special that made it dificult to integrate


[26-Apr-21 04:36 AM] Cryptoon#3362

[26-Apr-21 04:36 AM] jansako#3330

[26-Apr-21 04:36 AM] Cryptoon#3362
its usdt wrapped on bsc protocol I believe


[26-Apr-21 04:38 AM] jansako#3330
that one is pretty cheap & can be sent/withdrawn from Binance directly, or sent on from Binance as ERC-20 USDT so that is a good alternative


[26-Apr-21 04:38 AM] jansako#3330
the BEP-20 fees a cheap AFAIK


[26-Apr-21 04:46 AM] Cryptoon#3362
yeah for sure

[26-Apr-21 05:49 AM] gcharang#6833
USDT-ERC20 is not compatible because of thier contract being non-standard. but, USDT-BEP20 is compatible and already available in cli
it should be included in the next releases if it isn't available in desktop already


[26-Apr-21 08:16 AM] Ugchen#5960
Hey, sorry for late reply. I wasn¬¥t at home.

Where can I find this setting?

I¬¥m using AtomicDEX on MacOS and can¬¥t see the settings-menu. In AtomicDEX itself I can only hit "Retry" and on the menu-bar on upper screen-border there is no option until the app is connected.

Is there a way to reset assets config by hand?

are you the one with `AtomicDex Desktop 0.4.0-beta` and wrong system clock?
https://dexapi.cipig.net/public/error.php?uuid=507835de-7228-4004-8731-3e6853c38af4
`taker_swap:802] Started_at time_dif over 60 175`
60 > 175s, so all swaps will fail... only 60s deviation allowed... problem could also be on other side, but  worth checking that your clock is in sync: https://time.is


[26-Apr-21 11:35 AM] Malti#3948
time is exact according to time.is

alright. Closing mac later tonight is fine if nothing happened yet?

i'm the one buying MCL


[26-Apr-21 11:40 AM] cipi#4502
no, if you stop ADEX, swap will fail for sure, it needs to communicate with other party and with blockchain of coins

[26-Apr-21 11:42 AM] cipi#4502
i see, then likely other party is using default settings, which means it waits for a KMD notarization, which atm takes 20 - 30 minutes


[26-Apr-21 11:42 AM] Malti#3948

count is as a failed swap, it will return funds once it timed out and started to wait for locktime of tx to expire

It's works exactly the same way as ETH, so yeah you need BNB fuel for all operation involving BSC (binance smart chain) (BEP20)

is it possible to see if it's still trying or if it failed?


[27-Apr-21 06:21 AM] blackpanther222#0398
Step "maker payment validated and confirmed" needs the most time...how we can speed it up?


[27-Apr-21 06:21 AM] blackpanther222#0398
Why not make this step when maker create the order?


[27-Apr-21 06:23 AM] blackpanther222#0398
So when taker come this step will only need milliseconds


[27-Apr-21 06:40 AM] Slyris#2880
Hey !

There is few ways to speedup this step:

- Do not use blockchain that have a huge blocktime
- Try to disable dpow / reduce the number of confirmations when involving smartchain assets

We made a `KMD<->FIRO-BEP20` swap this morning, take 1min30sec only for the whole swap

yeah some swaps are super easy


[27-Apr-21 06:54 AM] Malti#3948
but the MCL one causes troubles for me


[27-Apr-21 07:08 AM] Refunding#6482
I had a swap, I put the Market Order and taker stopped the swap. After that, the process refunding  began. But nothing happens for 4 hours. And my funds are not returned.


[27-Apr-21 07:09 AM] Refunding#6482
"Your swap failed but the auto-refund process for your payment started already. Please wait and keep application opened until you receive your payment back"


[27-Apr-21 07:09 AM] Refunding#6482
But nothing happens for 4 hours. And my funds are not returned.


[27-Apr-21 07:10 AM] Refunding#6482
Could it be that funds will not return or return anyway in any case?


[27-Apr-21 07:13 AM] lightspeed393#5403
funds are normally always refunded, sometimes it takes quite a while. my last one took a bit more than 4 hours


[27-Apr-21 07:15 AM] Refunding#6482
Thanks for the answer. "Normally Always Refunded" that is, there are cases when they may not return?


[27-Apr-21 07:21 AM] Malti#3948
For me (and I've been abusing and not following aDex guidelines sometimes) my funds were always returned till now


[27-Apr-21 07:24 AM] Refunding#6482
"DEX GUIDELINES" You mean this: Please Wait and Keep Application Opened Until You Receive Your Payment Back.


[27-Apr-21 07:24 AM] Refunding#6482
Or are there any other instructions?


[27-Apr-21 07:25 AM] Malti#3948
That's what I meant. But I mean being connected, disconnected multiple times. Even then funds were always safu


[27-Apr-21 07:26 AM] Malti#3948
yesterday a swap initiated around 5pm was running for 3 hours


[27-Apr-21 07:26 AM] Malti#3948
closed my laptop for the night


[27-Apr-21 07:26 AM] Malti#3948
and this morning when reconnecting to aDex, my funds were returned after 10 mins


[27-Apr-21 07:30 AM] Refunding#6482
Thank you) then I will wait.

[27-Apr-21 07:38 AM] uak#6718
is this a known issue?


[27-Apr-21 07:38 AM] Slyris#2880
likely not lel


[27-Apr-21 07:38 AM] Slyris#2880
It's sounds like a graphical driver issue tbh


[27-Apr-21 07:39 AM] lightspeed393#5403
I said normally always because I've always had refunds but I've seen a few saying they've had issues and idk if they were resolved or not

Are you sure all your driver are up to date ?


[27-Apr-21 07:40 AM] Slyris#2880
Well that's sounds like a graphical bug of your whole screen, are you sure only adex is affected ?


[27-Apr-21 07:40 AM] uak#6718
yes


[27-Apr-21 07:40 AM] uak#6718
never seen it with any other software


[27-Apr-21 07:41 AM] Slyris#2880
Hmm i'm not sure then, but that's should not look like this


[27-Apr-21 07:41 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Looks strange. Can you tru to reproduce it 1 more time? To make sure it's reproducable.


[27-Apr-21 07:42 AM] Slyris#2880
I'm using linux, i lidoff atomicdex every night and i never got such a problem, you are on gnome ?


[27-Apr-21 07:42 AM] Refunding#6482
Thank you. I encountered this for the first time. And how much did you have any returns? If there were a lot of them and they always returned, then I have nothing to worry.


[27-Apr-21 07:43 AM] Slyris#2880
Sometimes in desktop it's required to click on Refund button, but you have a specific ‚ö†Ô∏è icon when your order is refundable


[27-Apr-21 07:45 AM] lightspeed393#5403
I've only ever had 2 times when I needed a refund and both eventually happened


[27-Apr-21 07:46 AM] gcharang#6833
afaik, all refunds, even ones with issues were eventually cleared

Yes, I click on him and it is written there  refunding.  And the green circle is spinning.


[27-Apr-21 07:51 AM] Refunding#6482
I just thought, maybe something is not normal, that 4 hours it does not return. But if you say that everyone always returns, then I will wait. Thank you.


[27-Apr-21 07:51 AM] Slyris#2880
oh then, you likely need to wait

BEP20 RPC nodes are overloaded, will likely cause issues when you have BEP20 tokens enabled


[27-Apr-21 08:53 AM] Slyris#2880

@Refunding my last swap also entered refund mode. I'll let you know what it does


[27-Apr-21 08:55 AM] cipi#4502
in theory yes... but read through the requirements and it needs 1TB free SSD space
have only 1.4 free and on the node where the damn ropsten runs only 1.2
so first thing would be to get rid of all possible testnets, like ropsten


[27-Apr-21 08:55 AM] Slyris#2880
is it a BEP20 orderbook?


[27-Apr-21 08:55 AM] cipi#4502
BTC and QTUM testnet would also save a lot


[27-Apr-21 08:55 AM] uak#6718
yes


[27-Apr-21 08:55 AM] Slyris#2880

Pinned a message.


[27-Apr-21 08:58 AM] cipi#4502
in between they also answer quick, like now with 0.5s, but in the last hour it was awfully slow, request taking 10s and timing out


[27-Apr-21 08:58 AM] Slyris#2880

few hours ago when pancakebunny was lagging, it was pointing to another API


[27-Apr-21 10:46 AM] cipi#4502
i have the same + the 2 other ones from https://docs.binance.org/smart-chain/developer/rpc.html
i tried the backup nodes too, manually, they all had long response times often
looks good atm though, hope it will last


[27-Apr-21 10:48 AM] phm87#7395
there is an unofficial "GUI" for pancakeswap that I'm using when official website laggs too much, I don't find which API it relies on:
<https://vfat.tools/bsc/pancake/>


[27-Apr-21 10:49 AM] phm87#7395

[27-Apr-21 11:11 AM] lightspeed393#5403
@cipi that last time the BSC servers were overloaded and you linked that article on github, it was a bit confusing. They stated it's not an issue with the BSC network itself being congested, just with the servers. But then put at the end how for greater chances of success to use a higher fee... I'm not sure how that makes much sense.


[27-Apr-21 11:16 AM] cipi#4502
lol, it does not make sense... yes, it's not the chain itself that is congested, just those RPC servers (like the electrums) are overloaded, so every request (balance, sendtx) taker either a long time to process or simply time out

here it says 16GB.... but RAM is not even the problem, the electrums have 384GB and only half in use, so that would fit perfectly... but they talk about 1TB SSD and recommend 2TB... altough here they say only 500GB https://github.com/binance-chain/bsc
i have 1.4 TB free... that's a bit too close i guess...


[27-Apr-21 11:30 AM] cipi#4502
could add 2 more SSDs to the servers, problem is only that it would be a separate device/raid, so compared to when all disks would be together in one RAID, i will loose some IO performance... but guess that's the better choice


[27-Apr-21 11:32 AM] phm87#7395
Oh but ... @! zpool.ca | crackers is running a BSC node, he should know how much disk and RAM it is using actually

oh, that would be really helpful... please üôÇ


[27-Apr-21 11:34 AM] cipi#4502
if it turns out it is only 700GB or so atm, i would start without new disks and postpone that for later

So custom ETH fees, I've never had to set a gas limit in gwei before. I know about gas price in gwei and gas used is a unit (21000) but gas limit in gwei I've never had to set before?

I'm only finding information that it's about the size in bytes of my transaction?


[27-Apr-21 01:59 PM] Biscuits#0462
Is gas limit actually in gwei, or units? If it's in gwei how can I find out my byte length lol

and when i try to take my usdt back to binance, atomicdex tell me "error checksum"


[28-Apr-21 05:53 AM] Slyris#2880
Do you use USDT bep20 @edwwie‚úß ?


[28-Apr-21 05:54 AM] Slyris#2880
Do you have BNB in this case ?


[28-Apr-21 05:54 AM] edwwie‚úß#8434

[28-Apr-21 05:54 AM] edwwie‚úß#8434
yes


[28-Apr-21 05:54 AM] Slyris#2880
And you have BNB ?


[28-Apr-21 05:55 AM] edwwie‚úß#8434
on atomicdex? i do not


[28-Apr-21 05:56 AM] Slyris#2880
AtomicDEX is a decentralized exchange BSC and ETH require gas for all operations involving their tokens.

Since you are using BSC version of USDT (USTD-BEP20) You need bnb for every operations


[28-Apr-21 05:56 AM] Slyris#2880
This is why you get an error when you try to swap or withdraw it


[28-Apr-21 05:56 AM] edwwie‚úß#8434
oh ok, do you know the amount needed?


[28-Apr-21 05:57 AM] Slyris#2880
Normally when you prepare a swap in the desktop, on the confirmation page you have the amount of fees to be paid in BNB


[28-Apr-21 05:57 AM] Slyris#2880
same when you withdraw, but a bug was fixed this week in this regards


[28-Apr-21 05:57 AM] Slyris#2880

Crackers told me that his bsc node is using ~800GB disk space and 6-7gb ram but maybe you will use more


[28-Apr-21 01:24 PM] cipi#4502
yes, i talked with him earlier... i started to sync... 75GB till now... wonder how long it will take


[28-Apr-21 01:28 PM] cipi#4502
btw, after the incident yesterday, it looks like they artificially slow down the responses (i guess in order to cope with the load)... every price update round on my marketmaker nodes now takes 20 minutes (instead of < 5), because it needs to fetch balance for every token and that now takes ages... it does not give error or times out like yesterday, but it takes long

I sent ETC to my atomicdex wallet and verified in an explorer that the transaction was successful, but the balance doesn‚Äôt show up even after 24 hours.   Any ideas on how to get the balance?


[28-Apr-21 08:26 PM] cipi#4502
you likely sent ETC on mainnet, but the ETC on AtomicDEX are BEP20, on BinanceSmartChain
i guess you will be able to use the private key of ETC or ETH from AtomicDEX in a wallet that supports ETC mainnet and recover those ETC


[28-Apr-21 08:47 PM] daemonfox#6136
Is the whole using BNB for BEP20 fees going to work in aDEX in the future. The more I try to play with BEP20 in aDEX, the more the whole thing is silly unless a direct onramp from Binance is made. Having to own BNB-BEP20 AND KMD-BEP20 just to even attempt to swap into the other is not useful. Is there no way to BEP20 any of them without already having a positive enough balance of that specific token to pay fees?

Ok thank you, I will study what that means and try to recover the ETC.   it was a very small amount, just in case this type of thing happened.


[28-Apr-21 08:58 PM] cipi#4502
it is the same with all this chains, QRC20, ERC20, BEP20, you need the main coin to pay fees, there is no other way to interact with these chains


[28-Apr-21 08:59 PM] cipi#4502
but you don't need KMD-BEP20, only BNB... fees are payed in BNB, regardless of which BEP20 token you play with


[28-Apr-21 09:01 PM] cipi#4502
you can withdraw BNB-BEP20 from other exchanges too, not only Binance... eg Coinex, there are for sure others too

OH! I read that min amount as that being the min fee required...


[28-Apr-21 09:09 PM] daemonfox#6136
Im used to it allowing the values to be clicked even if you dont have balance and it says the fee message below.


[28-Apr-21 09:09 PM] daemonfox#6136
Makes sense now.


[28-Apr-21 09:10 PM] daemonfox#6136
That was a shorcut to copy paste prices and adjust by 1 sat... cant do that now... gotta type it out completely.

@Slyris maybe this should be changed to allow people to click on the orders (and thus also see best_orders output)
if balance is < minvolume, just deacticate "Start swap" button as long as the order is selected

yes, fillin the values when click on orderbook order, like when all is ok and show error there, so click on order possible, values are copied to buy/sell, but "swap start" greyed out and error message like above screenshot


[28-Apr-21 09:25 PM] daemonfox#6136
Also to point out with BEP20... KMD is confusing... the buttons always say KMD no matter which way you go... i figure its a lot of text to make it say KMD-BEP20, but man its confusing having both sets of buttons say buy and sell KMD

[29-Apr-21 01:42 AM] jansako#3330
I was wondering why some assets no longer show in DEX as tradeable when enabled in the wallet. Were Supernet & DEX assets shut off too? But why? Funny thing is my orders placed in 4.0 still show as active on the orders list... I wonder if a swap would actually go through!


[29-Apr-21 02:16 AM] Klurk#7659
can I restore my coinomi wallet in to, or sweep the coins in to atomicdex-desktop. Or would I be stuck transferring coins to a new wallet?


[29-Apr-21 03:15 AM] TonyL#3577
`I was wondering why some assets no longer show in DEX as tradeable when enabled in the wallet.` possibility to trade these assets was disabled because of legal concerns.
You can cancel orders on older version ( @Slyris was good to remain the possibility to cancel existing order for assets with deactivated selection on the DEX page), sorry for inconvenience


[29-Apr-21 03:21 AM] jansako#3330

It's will not delete your old folder, but next versions should be able to self update themselves

Hey all, in a previous version of the AtomicDEX desktop I had added a custom erc20 token and now when I start it I get an error message saying the asset cannot be added. Could this be because it has no price information? I was able to use it in the previous version

Hi, how to backup atomicDex wallet?


[29-Apr-21 07:12 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
I mean, where is the file with private keys (seed) located?


[29-Apr-21 07:14 AM] gcharang#6833
you can export seed words from settings


[29-Apr-21 07:20 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
You mean that I can copy seed words to clipboard (and then paste it to a file) or just read qr code?


[29-Apr-21 07:21 AM] gcharang#6833
yes, copy paste to an encrypted store or better yet, write them down on a paper


[29-Apr-21 07:22 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880

make sure you have no coins in the wallet and delete it through settings

Do I need to keep AtomicDex open to keep my orders active, or do they continue to be tradable when I have closed AtomicDex?


[29-Apr-21 08:08 AM] CHMEX#0686
App needs to be open


[29-Apr-21 08:08 AM] Chief Crypto#2529
Gotch. Thanks!


[29-Apr-21 08:42 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
So what happens with active orders when you close atomicDex?


[29-Apr-21 08:42 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
Do they stay active?


[29-Apr-21 09:12 AM] CHMEX#0686
No they will be removed after a while


[29-Apr-21 09:12 AM] Slyris#2880
They are still active but they aren't connected to the p2p network anymore


[29-Apr-21 09:13 AM] CHMEX#0686
Becuase the key to spend is on your machine it needs to stay open


[29-Apr-21 09:13 AM] Slyris#2880
So they couldn't match and on top of that it's dangerous because price change a lot those days, so you probably want to enable the self update feature to avoid such a situation

[29-Apr-21 10:26 AM] daemonfox#6136
your seed phrase or custom key/phrase used in aDEX GUIs is what generates your key.


[29-Apr-21 10:26 AM] daemonfox#6136
It is only ever held there, and is used only to locally sign transactions or messages to be broadcast.


[29-Apr-21 10:35 AM] lightspeed393#5403
he's referring to orders not seeds


[29-Apr-21 10:35 AM] lightspeed393#5403
I'm not sure about the orders themselves, but I know swap data is stored locally on your desktop


[29-Apr-21 10:43 AM] jansako#3330
orders are broadcast but must be rebroadcast every so often. Otherwise they disappear form the orderbooks. If you are nto online, they would not match anyway, like it was said above.


[29-Apr-21 11:26 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
Thank you guys, I'm trying to understand how atomicDex works. One more thing I don't get is how are opposite orders at the same price  possible in the order book?


[29-Apr-21 11:28 AM] lightspeed393#5403
what do you mean by opposite orders?


[29-Apr-21 11:28 AM] Slyris#2880
This is because of min_volume stuff mostly


[29-Apr-21 11:28 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
bid and ask


[29-Apr-21 11:28 AM] Slyris#2880
He means that bid and ask have same price


[29-Apr-21 11:28 AM] Slyris#2880
Few reasons can produce such a behavior


[29-Apr-21 11:28 AM] Slyris#2880

Min_volume

Take a look at Rick and Morty test coins


[29-Apr-21 11:34 AM] Slyris#2880
This is because you can create maker_order that are directly in bid, but there is  bidirectional orderbook RICK/MORTY and MORTY/RICK so if you place maker_order in both orderbook you will have this possibility


[29-Apr-21 11:35 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
Thanks, that makes sense.


[29-Apr-21 11:47 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
Is there any detailed tutorial on how atomicDex works?


[29-Apr-21 11:56 AM] cipi#4502
maker orders never match other maker orders, only taker orders match maker orders, so there can be negative spread in orderbook, which you can use to your advantage... https://dexstats.info/arbitrage.php shows the current opportunities... none atm


[29-Apr-21 11:56 AM] Slyris#2880
you are looking for a swap tutorial ?


[29-Apr-21 11:57 AM] cipi#4502
also when taker order does not match (for whatever reason, could be error), it will be turned into a maker order after x seconds


[29-Apr-21 11:58 AM] cipi#4502
this is at least the default behavior atm in the GUIs... API supports other order types too: https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.html#buy

that's actually the best part, it doesn't need to be a serious thing

i don't own any doge either but i do see the potential in leveraging a viral community and giving them a decent app. i think we could even take it further and contribute to the dogecoin core. help them update some things. it would really put us in a good light without having to spend tons of resources.

you enabled many coins in a batch requests and some electrums failed... click on the message to see which one, i doubt it is really CHIPS

FYI When I click the "+" icon to add more coins to the list (beyond KMD and BTC) in "light mode" (e.g. screen is white) the text list of coins is white on off-white and can barely be seen.


[01-May-21 11:51 AM] sowtime444#2744
When I moved KMD from Bittrex to AtomicDEX (Windows), Bittrex said it was going to charge 0.002 KMD. Then when it was received in the wallet, the AtomicDEX UI seems to indicate that another 0.001 KMD is your "fee". However, it doesn't appear that an extra 0.001 KMD was taken out, so I'm confused.

0.002 they include the 0.001 from the transaction


[01-May-21 01:08 PM] Slyris#2880
You are confused because you send from a centralized exchange to a decentralized one, they have a withdrawal fees that include the transaction too

send entire CLC balance to yourself and try again... the number of utxos in your address seem huge... better not mine to same address used in AtomicDEX


[02-May-21 01:48 PM] jspook16#3059
when selecting MAX with the slider, fees are not subtracted so orders get automatically rejected. Can it be automatic to subtract fee from MAX?

ok, thought because the number of utxos was so big... but maybe it's not even your swap... use the above link with your own failed swap uuid to find out what went wrong on other side

Can you clarify your question ?


[03-May-21 02:16 AM] FV89#5870
Hi all, 

I started working with Atomic Dex last week, but ran into an issue;
1) I wanted to swap KMD for VRSC so opened a Maker order in DEX on April 29. 
2) The order stayed open for a day at least, but did not seem to be filled. 
3) At some point, I had to back-up my computer and shut down the system (to get a replacement device). 
4) I logged in again, and now see in my Wallet that my KMD has been sent on May 1, but I did not receive any VRSC. I also cannot see the order in the DEX orders, nor history (it's just blank). 

What could be the issue and how do I solve?


[03-May-21 02:24 AM] FV89#5870
@cipi do you happen to have any idea?


[03-May-21 02:26 AM] jansako#3330
What is the current state of the order? Is it on the list, what does it show when you click on it?


[03-May-21 02:31 AM] FV89#5870
It is no longer listed. 
It was visible today (with a red/orange dot) but I rushed to click "cancel order" and it disappeared.

The only "trace" I see, is when I click on "KMD sent" in my Wallet


[03-May-21 02:57 AM] cipi#4502
`Waited too long until 1619916473 for transaction to be confirmed 2 times`... ADEX waits for the tx to be confiremd, but that never happens...


[03-May-21 02:58 AM] blackpanther222#0398
@cipi Ok...that means? Is that an error from me or from adex?


[03-May-21 03:00 AM] cipi#4502
idk why tx is not confirmed, maybe it's not even sent out
i would consolidate my utxos on this address, so ADEX does not need to use 100 utxos to sent  out the tx


[03-May-21 03:02 AM] jansako#3330
meaning send all of your balance to yourself


[03-May-21 03:02 AM] blackpanther222#0398
My clc balance?


[03-May-21 03:02 AM] jansako#3330
whatever coin you are trying to send out.


[03-May-21 03:03 AM] jansako#3330
BTW, the cancelled order and its status shoudl still be visible in your order history


[03-May-21 03:03 AM] blackpanther222#0398
Yeah...its visible


[03-May-21 03:05 AM] cipi#4502
if there was a swap, there also needs to be infos about this swap in your history
i assume the KMD sent are not related to a swap... if you post the txid, i can have a look, swap txes are easily identifiable


[03-May-21 03:24 AM] FV89#5870
The amount sent in the swap and the Wallet history are the same. 

In the DEX history, there are no records (there was an open order before, but I cancelled)


[03-May-21 03:24 AM] FV89#5870
So I have no Txid


[03-May-21 03:28 AM] cipi#4502
if there was a swap, then there is a swap uuid and if there was a tx, there is txid


[03-May-21 03:29 AM] cipi#4502
you can input the KMD address in block explorer and browse through all transactions to or from this address: https://kmdexplorer.io/


[03-May-21 03:30 AM] Malti#3948
I know FV89 and checked his aDex screenshots


[03-May-21 03:31 AM] Malti#3948
current orders + history is empty. There is a Tx Hash from the KMD that was sent out


[03-May-21 03:37 AM] cipi#4502
i want to see that tx in explorer... then i can tell if it was a swap or not


[03-May-21 03:37 AM] Malti#3948
I'll check with him

[03-May-21 03:47 AM] cipi#4502
this is from a swap... the tx was sent but never spent by the other side
to recover such a swap, the files from the swap are needed on the device
was the swap done by another device? have you used the same passphrase in another installation?


[03-May-21 03:49 AM] FV89#5870
Swap was done on another device yes, but that device will likely be wiped (as it's in repair) 
Have not used the passphrase in another installation


[03-May-21 03:53 AM] cipi#4502
you need the device which started the swap, the swap data are saved on that device and this data is needed to refund the failed swap
btw, found the swap uuid of the swap: `50e2a5ed-15d4-46cc-a509-a66f01366d1a`, but only from the taker (you were the maker in this swap)


[03-May-21 03:56 AM] cipi#4502
@gcharang do you know if there is a way to reconstruct the missing swap json on a new device? problem is also that the json file is not present on seed nodes either, only that from other party.


[03-May-21 04:05 AM] gcharang#6833
we have to manually construct it. can you send me the taker json for this swap and also another swap json where you are the maker and there was a successful refund for it

hi all, 
on the 0.4.2 portable version, the atomicdex tab don't show up in the horizontal windows bar at the botom of my screen. This issue arise both on My laptop win7 and my desktop pc win10
I'm free to discuss it if needed
Also, do you knox when the auto scaling option will be implemented ? when using atomicdex from my desktop PC on my TV I get very large charts but tiny texts
Thank you all üëç


[03-May-21 04:16 AM] Slyris#2880
Hey @GuilouGuilouOTE The horizontal windows bar is fixed in dev branch, expect a new release soon (0.4.3) - regarding auto scaling it's required a tremendous amount of work right now but we are exploring https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/scalability.html it's will take some time to go through all scalability requirements but before 1.0 this should be solved

Hi @gcharang it was my very first swap and the device with which I did the swap is currently being repaired (and possible will be wiped and reset). 
What can I do on my current device? 
How could the swap only complete 1 side of the transaction?

there is only the error from one side, the taker, he waited for maker to send MakerPayment, but that hasn't happened... unfortunately no info yet from maker... that info is only there after maker has finished swap (guess he still waits for something, eg refund)... will be there later (in case maker has not gone up in flames and never returns)
were you maker or taler?

so fault was on maker side perhaps he closed atomicdex or had not balance?

he likely stopped atomicdex... if no balance, swap would not even start

Good morning!  Here is finally my video covering the Komodo Platform.  It is a long-ass video so you may want to pull up a chair.  I try to cover to the best of my abilities all the essential concepts of the Komodo Platform. I did get stuck on the Atomic DEX when I tried to use it, but I will figure that one out later.  Overall, I think it is a ...

It's honestly a fantastic perspective. He could not figure out how to make a trade. Then he had $39 of btc and couldnt make a swap when he did figure it out

hi 
i am using atomicdex desktop . i have around 0.65 verus coin in my wallet when i want to send it to another verus wallet  i get this error :
[{"error":"rpc:253] lp_coins:1011] utxo_common:1387] Couldn't generate tx from empty UTXOs set"}]


[05-May-21 12:37 AM] smkhound#7640
DM me your logs / address I can take a look. Were these coins mined?


[05-May-21 01:11 AM] PCvid#6585
they have mined in luckpool.net


[05-May-21 01:22 AM] cipi#4502
saw many small DOGE swaps and thought i remind people of one important thing: txfee on DOGE chain is 1 DOGE and dust amount is also 1 DOGE (so in the worst case txfee will be 1.9999.... DOGE)
it makes absolutely no sense to swap 10 DOGE, you will pay 10-20% on txfees
guess i need to introduce min_volume for DOGE too, just like with BTC and ETH


[05-May-21 01:23 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
> it makes absolutely no sense to swap 10 DOGE, you will pay 10-20% on txfees
the sense being that one can


[05-May-21 01:24 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
micromanaging what folks think other folks should want to do will likely lead to an undesired outcome someday


[05-May-21 01:24 AM] cipi#4502
luckily mm2 sets min_volume automatically to 10x dust for all coins, else people would likely swap 1 DOGE and pay 2 DOGE txfees üòÑ


[05-May-21 01:32 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
> else people would likely swap 1 DOGE and pay 2 DOGE txfees
and if they knowingly wanted to do so, a DEX would disallow it because why?


[05-May-21 01:34 AM] smkhound#7640
`the transaction was rejected by network rules.\\n\\nAcceptToMemoryPool: absurdly high fees`


[05-May-21 01:36 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
there's long gap between what the doge wallet will allow by default if that's actually the case, and "there's no sense to why you'd want to, maybe I should set some min volume I think you should want to use"


[05-May-21 01:39 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
and I still maintain that if a user is knowingly willing to dump off $187 in BTC fees to buy $50 worth of KMD, a DEX would allow it


[05-May-21 01:42 AM] cipi#4502
it does... but everyone can set min_volume for his orders, which i will now do for DOGE too on my orders


[05-May-21 02:16 AM] Farl#9964
I get a lot of errors on AtomicDEX. I think it has something to do with me adding the whole list of assets last week. How can I fix this?

This is the difference between a 'freedom first' mentality which is great in general, and 'sensible application design' which creates better user experience and higher user satisfaction over the long run. I would much rather have one person bitching that I do not let them lose money just because they want to, than have 10 people bitching that they lost money when there was a simple and sensible way of stopping that. You can bet your last dime that those 10 'not very smart users' will NOT blame themselves for the mistake... 
Do you want to lose one user or ten?

Is there a way to swap a coin (UTXO) for a BEP20 token without having BNB?


[05-May-21 02:29 AM] Slyris#2880
Unfortunately not, BEP20 swaps require the gas to be paid in BNB :/

How can I get some BNB using atomicDex?

Indeed, the choice is between covering our butt with a warning, or only let the user do the sensible thing. Let the CLI crowd do stoopid stuff if they want to.

I can't think of a single time in history where a ruling party said "I know what's good for you and that's better for you than you being free to do what you want" has gone wrong in the end.....

that is only if the ruled have no alternative


[05-May-21 02:31 AM] Slyris#2880
Nop, but in fact there is some BNB faucet on the net, you can just put your adex address here, should be enough to initiate a swap and buy BNB


[05-May-21 02:31 AM] jansako#3330

Later you will be able to buy BNB-BEP2 without any BNB in your wallet, because BNB-BEP2 use cosmos technology which is different than BEP20 (eth fork)


[05-May-21 02:33 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
it's literally not
nothing could be more "on topic" than a discussion about "rules" in a DEX layer app that people will perceive as the actual DEX


[05-May-21 02:33 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah but i mean is not that much a problem if you cannot initiate a swap that will make you loose money, i don't understand why you are so sensitive to that


[05-May-21 02:34 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
And how am I not losing *more* money if I can't get rid of the coin at all?

going with the 1:2 of earlier instead of taking a 60% loss I must take a 100% loss

How about a 'feature' called 'dust sale'? If you check that box, it will ignore the tx fee limitation as long as the sum of the sale is positive?

No matter that the 'dust' is 5 million coin X

Depends, in case of DOGE, if you have 0.9 doge, you cannot dust/burn/trade anything


[05-May-21 02:42 AM] jansako#3330
Of course, but that is a network limitation, not a DEX one

everybody is free to set his orders as he wishes... if anybody wants to sell 10 DOGE, he can do that, it will just not be me buying that, that's all... the only technical limitation atm is 10x dust in mm2... and 0.00777 for BTC (but i hope that will be removed)


[05-May-21 02:50 AM] mrlynch#5735
it really should be down to the user if they want to pay 20% of swap to txfees.. maybe a warning is enough instead of a limitation?!


[05-May-21 02:50 AM] mrlynch#5735
the point of a dex is to be decentralized and have freedom over what and how is swapped no?! (subject to coin support of course)

Thats good concerns raised above on UI/UX related to the fees unproportionate to swap amount. I don't think than forbidding is the right way but we definitely should think about the ways of making users to not do crazy things since they might not be aware that some cryptocurrencies (e.g. BTC) doesn't work good for microtransactions and for atomic swaps as particular case

Well if you are taker the risk of a disconnection is that you can loose your taker fee for ever, in case you disconnect and still have unmatched order is not a problem, but when you reconnect price may have changed

Since it's p2p protocol you can simplify it to torrent example (however, we not using libtorrent for p2p stack anymore): when seed is offline he can't distribute a file because he is offline and it's not possible to download it üôÇ 
In case of maker order you are the seed - on ordermatching you need to exchange messages with matching taker so have to be online, to broadcast txs in swap you have to sign it so have to be online - thats all about messages exchanging in protocol

@Farl you can place a maker order, then later shut down your PC. Nothing will happen to it unless the swap is in progress. Next time you start your DEX, the orders will be there waiting for you & will start to get broadcast again. The main thing to remember is that nobody can see & match your orders if you go offline, but they will be posted again when you get online. 
I have some orders up for months across a number of application updates... I will take my profit when the price will get there...

Shesshhhhh. From a crypto rookie I think a simple pop-up ‚Äúplease confirm you want to lose money‚Äù or ‚Äúthis swap will cost XX% of your order to swap‚Äù. Any type of warning would be great.

Also open to compatible  some custom addons.

Like what chainzilla or chainmakers did before but automated.

As addition, it can be part of dex listing plan @PTYX

It's definitely possible


[05-May-21 07:33 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
Can this be explained. From looking at internet explanations, it speaks in terms of numbers, relative volume of 2 or higher being preferred. How does this correlate to the bar graphic?


[05-May-21 07:33 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
Ie: where is 2?


[05-May-21 07:34 AM] smkhound#7640
its just kinda like, the longer bars have more volume depth

A few UX/UI considerations when logging into Atomic Dex for the first time: 

1. During onboarding, guided tool tips should be enable that walk you through the most important features and considerations. For example: I wanted to immediately start swapping but couldn't find any coins to swap to, because I hadn't added them as assets in my dashboard. 

2. "Add asset" before you have any holdings in a coin, is quite counter-intuitive. It should be explained -as simple as possible- why you need to add an asset before you can create a swap. 

3. My first reaction to this was: well, why don't I then add all the assets in the list so I never have to worry about this action again? If this would result in any performance limitations, this should also be clearly highlighted, to avoid many users thinking the same thing. 
If it does result in performance limits, but should still be possible, perhaps a scheduled removal of an asset (after X weeks of inactivity on that asset) should be an option in the settings

4. The DEX view was quite confusing; 
- I normally would expect to make a "limit" or "market" swap, rather than "taker" and "maker". 
Perhaps with some help texts on "price" and "volume", you could make it more clear for users. 
- it's confusing to see the totals on top of the price and volume; intuitively I would expect to see this below
- I still don't really know what the difference is between
(a) KMD <=> VRSC: Sell KMD
(b) VRSC <=> KMD: Buy VRSC
- the purpose of the slider was not clear in the beginning

5. KMD-VRSC chart data is not available, which is strange considering the orders visible. Can't you draw the chart based on the orders available? 

6. I do not understand why the prices on DEX were always 10-15% higher than the prices on CEX. Besides the argument of safety, I don't see the benefit over established CEXs

7. As a mac user, I'm used to seeing the 3 colored dots on the upper left corner, instead of the windows controls on the top right ü§ì

Atomicdex send komodo out has to be to bsc address? if so, then i lost 1 KMD oof


[05-May-21 09:42 AM] laras#4981
I sent it in as normal kmd to atomicdex thought it would come out as normal too, new to kmd oops.


[05-May-21 09:44 AM] laras#4981
It's on 37 confirms should show up at 30 right?


[05-May-21 09:44 AM] laras#4981
If the send out is bsc only, then that should get a mention when sending out, or cancel when normal kmd addy is given?


[05-May-21 09:44 AM] laras#4981
how to lose crypto 101 :p


[05-May-21 09:46 AM] Slyris#2880
Depends which KMD you withdraw ? Bep20 or normal one ?


[05-May-21 09:49 AM] laras#4981
Well when you send in KMD, it is normal KMD.


[05-May-21 09:49 AM] laras#4981
And then when you click send (to withdraw), it does not mention it is either normal KMD or BEP20


[05-May-21 09:49 AM] laras#4981
I just put normal address in to withdraw, but i think the send out is only bep20...


[05-May-21 09:50 AM] laras#4981
Need confirm whether i lost my single KMD üòõ


[05-May-21 09:50 AM] laras#4981

Well i can just see it back tx details on atomicdex


[05-May-21 09:56 AM] lightspeed393#5403
if you have both normal and bep-20 kmd enabled the wallet page will show 2 different coins. One for each.


[05-May-21 09:58 AM] laras#4981
seems like it is bep-20 only on atomicdex


[05-May-21 09:58 AM] laras#4981
my point tho is> i bought normal kmd on binance, send that over to atomicdex, send 1 back to binance, all to normal addresses


[05-May-21 09:59 AM] laras#4981
the send out (withdraw) function on atomicdex fails to mention that what kmd you have there is bep20.


[05-May-21 09:59 AM] laras#4981
also no warn when you put normal kmd address then


[05-May-21 09:59 AM] lightspeed393#5403
no it is not

yes a R address


[05-May-21 10:00 AM] cipi#4502
yes, and when you put in the wrong address on withdraw, it will show error `invalid address`


[05-May-21 10:01 AM] laras#4981
Yes ok i did it right, just not showed up on the binance then.


[05-May-21 10:01 AM] lightspeed393#5403
binance takes like 120 confirmations


[05-May-21 10:01 AM] laras#4981
I only had normal KMD enabled, and only send normal KMD in, and only send normal KMD out

Good news, it is planned and it will allow to have a good overview of the application.

> 2

The solution above will also solve this one, we will explain this part in the tutorial.

> 3

We discussed with @TonyL  today an issue and a pull request are under development by @syl 

https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/pull/886
https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/issues/884

> 4

A simple trading view is being developed by @syl 
https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/pull/889
https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/issues/625

> 5

We use trading view for the charts, and they do not have a KMD/VRSC chart, a future self hosting of trading view / with our own aggregator can be one of the solutions.

> 6 

It is a liquidity problem, research is underway to address this. @PTYX can tell you a bit more
I know that @cipi provide some liquidity its rarely above 3-6% of the CEX prices.
There is a best orders widget in the app if you fill volume, best orders will start to appear, then you can select an order from that, a one that match your price expectation let's say

> 7

It's also planned, @Enokas WeS will take care of this. We closed the precedent PR in this regards but we will do it soon.

but it doesnt sell it only put up order in order book


[05-May-21 12:54 PM] blackpanther222#0398
You shouldnt make order as maker....you have to take the 0,5 order from maker


[05-May-21 01:01 PM] cipi#4502
i tried that specific order and it matched
could mean that the node banned you (or you him) because of failed swaps with that node from the past
restart your ADEX, that way you at least remove the ban on your side, maybe it's enough

do wallet addresses changes in atomicdex, aka can i use it as address on donate buttons?


[05-May-21 10:55 PM] gcharang#6833
no, one wallet gives you 1 set of seed words and they are used to generate a single address for each coin available. multi address wallets(HD) on atomicdex maybe available in the future


[05-May-21 11:31 PM] laras#4981
so the receive address stays the same for every coin? aka, i can use these addresses for donate buttons?


[05-May-21 11:35 PM] gcharang#6833
no, the receiving address is different for each coin.  most of the coins have different address formats and the same address won't work on all the coin networks. but yes, you can use the addresses atomicdex provides as donation addresses. say you are accepting btc, kmd, doge as donations, you have to enable each coin on atomicdex and copy their addresses onto your website

because both KMD and CHIPS wait for the transaction to be notarized... speed will improve when notaries switch to more frequent notarizations... till then, you can simply disable notarization in ADEX and use x confirmations instead

My question is, are there any plans for TurtleNetwork to be included in atmoicDEX?

Please, need some help... i cant send my usdt from my atomic dex to my binance account. Receive was fast and perfect but i  cant sent it back... i copy my bep20 tether adresss ... max amount ... prepare.. and see this error message

[{"error":"rpc:253] lp_coins:1011] eth:402] eth:397] eth:2812] Invalid address checksum"}]

thanks!


[08-May-21 06:42 PM] smkhound#7640
@Chaiman888 for checksum pass, address needs to be in mixed case - Binance deposit keeps lowercase.
You can search deposit address here - https://www.bscscan.com/
It will convert to mixed case, then copy. 
To be sure, send small amount, once you see in binance incoming deposits, send the rest.

@Audo or @PTYX  , it was suggested I ping you guys over here. Just had a quick question about something we have been discussing over on the Pirate servers. Polarity (a DEX that supports Pirate) on Turtle network, are both supporters and/or members of BPSAA along with Komodo devs. Seems like a no brainer for TurtleNetwork to be included in atmoicDEX, which would both add a easier direct network path to their DEX for Pirate users and build out the BPSAA community. So my question is, are there any plans for TN to be added to atomicDEX?


[09-May-21 08:35 AM] PTYX#6840
It's the first time I've heard of turtle network


[09-May-21 08:35 AM] PTYX#6840
I'll ask around with our devs to see if it's on their radar

[09-May-21 01:53 PM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
Yeah I had not either until I started looking into it more, but they are a founding member of BPSAA along with Pirate, KMD jl777, etc. (you are listed on BPSAA as a dev).  so it would make sense and add a little functionality for us on Pirate that also hold KMD https://bpsaa.vision/members. Thanks for looking into it.

maker was already refunded, https://www.kmdexplorer.io/tx/246c266d463606aabceb76ac2ba1786d329416029ad40612f82c922c269eb103
taker side shows only an error on TakerPayment
```
      {
         "timestamp" : 1620509385898,
         "event" : {
            "type" : "TakerPaymentTransactionFailed",
            "data" : {
               "error" : "taker_swap:995] Timeout 1620509385 > 1620485101"

            "type" : "Finished"
         },
         "timestamp" : 1620509385902
```
so from this info, there is nothing to refund because TakerPayment was not sent
but i see https://etherscan.io/tx/0xd83264f1e28676bedd9cbf76e7bcba7f6bb8ffe70a8c0b061bfc8ab18cfee20a, which seems to be the missing TakerPayment
@artem.pikulin can you help us out? timeout on TakerPaymentTransactionFailed but TakerPayment was actually sent.


[10-May-21 01:05 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@cipi The swap should have `recoverable:true` in this case, if I'm not mistaken. So there should be `unlock funds` button in GUI that will refund the ETH.


[10-May-21 01:10 AM] cipi#4502
hmmm, not sure, since the swap json actually says "there was no TakerPayment because Timeout"... but i only see what's on the seed nodes
@Anthony007 do you see a "recover funds" button?


[10-May-21 04:04 AM] Anthony007#3956
Do you mean in the dex wallet?


[10-May-21 04:04 AM] cipi#4502
yes, there should be a "recover funds" button next to the failed swap


[10-May-21 04:05 AM] Anthony007#3956
Let me check.


[10-May-21 04:19 AM] Anthony007#3956
Hi I canjt see a refund button. Can i send you av few screenshots. Transaction says failed. But in my eth transaction it says eth transaction confirmed,


[10-May-21 04:20 AM] Anthony007#3956
It me it looks the eth has gone but the kmd noet received


[10-May-21 04:23 AM] Anthony007#3956
yes it looks ;like taker payment was sent.


[10-May-21 04:35 AM] cipi#4502
on DEX page, not wallet page... in the history tab of the swaps


[10-May-21 04:40 AM] Anthony007#3956
Yes i checked in the history tab it says failed but no recover buttot. I am using an ipad. Its more tjhan $2400


[10-May-21 04:41 AM] Anthony007#3956
i will check again now.


[10-May-21 04:50 AM] Anthony007#3956
from what i can see the ether has delivered. I can see it on etherscan. Already sent.


[10-May-21 04:51 AM] Anthony007#3956
There is no recover button.


[10-May-21 04:53 AM] cipi#4502
yes, i know, but ADEX thinks it wasn't and the swap json says that too... likely the timeout happened after mm2 sent the tx out and he couldn't check if it was sent or not


[10-May-21 04:53 AM] cipi#4502
i fear manual intervention will be needed to recover those ETH


[10-May-21 04:55 AM] Anthony007#3956
so can you arrange it. Its very late and I need to go to bed.


[10-May-21 04:56 AM] cipi#4502
you could try and update your Atomicdex, i see you use 
`atomicDEX 0.4.1 iOS` while 0.4.2 is latest version and 0.4.3 was released yesterday


[10-May-21 04:56 AM] Anthony007#3956
Do you know how that happens?


[10-May-21 04:56 AM] cipi#4502
no, looks like an edge case when network is unreliable


[10-May-21 04:57 AM] Anthony007#3956
If i update i worry i will loose what is in their.


[10-May-21 04:58 AM] Anthony007#3956
so you want me to update the atomicdex app?


[10-May-21 05:01 AM] cipi#4502
the app keeps the data, even after update
but i am not the dev, @yurii-khican tell us


[10-May-21 05:02 AM] Anthony007#3956
ok i will  try and see.


[10-May-21 05:10 AM] Anthony007#3956
it cannot be updated as its still in test flight. Still versian 0.4.1

I was live watching a swap happen on AtomicDEX for myself. Cool that all went well, but it took about 33 minutes before the swap was completed. Why does it take this long?


[10-May-21 05:45 AM] jansako#3330
Depends on what are you swapping & hw many confirmation do you have it set. e.g. if you are swapping with BTC & need 2 confirms, just the sending BTC part can take 30 mins... Other coins have different blocktimes.

atomicDEX only has ETC as a BEP-20 token afaik, and it looks like you used the traditional mainnet type


[10-May-21 12:28 PM] .123 | $ARRR#5222
so that coin is lost for good i take it?


[10-May-21 12:29 PM] lightspeed393#5403
You should be able to recover it by getting the private key from your seed in atomicDEX, then import it into a ETC wallet and recover your coins there


[10-May-21 12:29 PM] .123 | $ARRR#5222
could you suggest an etc wallet that would do that?


[10-May-21 12:29 PM] lightspeed393#5403

[10-May-21 12:30 PM] .123 | $ARRR#5222
ok np


[10-May-21 12:31 PM] lightspeed393#5403
a quick google search shows there's a lot of wallets that allow importing private keys, I just don't have any experience with them


[10-May-21 12:36 PM] .123 | $ARRR#5222

[10-May-21 12:37 PM] Slyris#2880
you can use the same private key as eth i think


[10-May-21 12:38 PM] lightspeed393#5403
go into settings and get the actual private key


[10-May-21 12:38 PM] lightspeed393#5403
as slyris said you should be able to use ETH (I think they're the same).

[10-May-21 12:56 PM] lightspeed393#5403
I'd recommend KMD, it has the most liquidity on atomicDEX


[10-May-21 12:56 PM] lightspeed393#5403
or maybe LTC. DOGE has good liquidity too


[10-May-21 12:56 PM] .123 | $ARRR#5222
liquidity in this case is people buying and selling right?


[10-May-21 12:56 PM] lightspeed393#5403

I just don't understand how those "depth" bars are calculated. What is going on, why does the top teeny order have that large bar?


[11-May-21 12:43 AM] Farl#9964
What do you mean? In AtomicDEX? How?


[11-May-21 12:53 AM] jansako#3330
There is a checkbox (green) on the order confirmation page. It is on by default & makes you wait 2 notarizations. I think the taker can do the same, so you have at least a total of 4 for the trade to complete.


[11-May-21 12:56 AM] jansako#3330
Also, I noticed that it looks like some takers have started to use the 'futures contract' functionality of Adex. Basically they initiate the trade, send their deposit, then go offline for  some time. If the price moves against them, they will just never complete the trade. They are out of DEX fee, you are out of tx fee. If the price moves against you , you can't auto-adjust it cause the swap is ongoing. It is not a built in feature, just works that way.

There's no errors. But on the explorer page (above), there might be some coding errors in output address.

The block time of coins involved has a lot to do with swap time.


[13-May-21 09:13 PM] lightspeed393#5403
yes you can. restore a wallet and use the private key as the seed

the AtomicDEX-API can be accessed via python's requests module relatively simply by using the methods documented at https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.html
e.g.
```
def orderbook(node_ip, user_pass, base, rel):
    params = {'userpass': user_pass,
              'method': 'orderbook',
              'base': base, 'rel': rel,}
    r = requests.post(node_ip, json=params)
    return r
```


[14-May-21 03:32 AM] volker002#2450
thanx. I already had some success using requests.


[14-May-21 03:35 AM] volker002#2450
When I query the _orderbook_ the _netid_ is 7777 rather than 0 and the entries don't seem to reflect the actual order book. Looks like I'm on the test-net

BTCZ -> KMD swap. TakerPaymentReceived - 2h 39m and swap still is ongoing. üòï   Is it Ok that it's taking so long?


[14-May-21 06:07 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
TakerPaymentReceived - 3h 40m and still ongoing...


[14-May-21 06:23 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
Could anyone help me with this swap?


[14-May-21 07:05 AM] gcharang#6833
btcz chain has blocks with irregular timings (https://explorer.btcz.rocks/blocks). most likely that either the taker or maker has timed out with an error.  if your coins have been sent, you will have to wait for locktime to expire so that you can claim them


[14-May-21 07:12 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
I  am a maker.  Maker payment (BTCZ) sent with 96 confirmations.


[14-May-21 07:13 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
What's the locktime?


[14-May-21 07:28 AM] gcharang#6833
@cipi  will know for sure. for most coins it is around 4 hours for the maker


[14-May-21 07:37 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
Thanks @gcharang It's been more than 5 hours since the beginning of the swap.  TakerPaymentReceived still ongoing.


[14-May-21 07:43 AM] gcharang#6833
if `takerpaymentreceived`  happened already, your app should try to spend it. can you tell me from how long `takerpaymentreceived` is ongoing?


[14-May-21 07:44 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
takerpaymentreceived - now it's 5h 17m and keeps going.


[14-May-21 07:46 AM] gcharang#6833
other than waiting for the swap to timeout or proceed, there is nothing we can do to intervene in between. what is the taker's coin ?


[14-May-21 07:48 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
BTCZ (me, maker)-> KMD (taker) @gcharang

if you want to know for sure, simply look in the JSON of the swap, it will contain something like this
```
      {
         "timestamp" : 1620995370705,
         "event" : {
            "data" : {
               "wait_until" : 1621042555
            },
            "type" : "MakerPaymentWaitRefundStarted"
         }
      }
```
the time to wait for refund starts after swap was declared as failed, which can be 1-2h after swap started, eg when notarizations are enabled for KMD...


[14-May-21 08:29 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
Where can I find the JSON of my swap?


[14-May-21 08:31 AM] cipi#4502
~/.atomic_qt/mm2/DB/... somewhere there

I have two files with my swap ID. First one is with .json extension and second one is with .lock extension. Btw, it's been 6 hours since the beginning of the swap and  it's still ongoing.


[14-May-21 08:41 AM] cipi#4502
look into the .json


[14-May-21 08:43 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880

[14-May-21 08:48 AM] cipi#4502
related to enabling all coins... enable fewer coins


[14-May-21 09:09 AM] Slyris#2880
Delete your ~/Library/Application Support/AtomicDEX Desktop/config/your_json_wallet_file and restart the app, please don't enable all coins, we are going to limit the number of coin enabled in 0.4.3


[14-May-21 09:21 AM] g59#6881
Thanks @Slyris and @cipi that worked.. why did it failed and were any log that I could have seen to troubleshoot this issue?

In the appdata directory you have a logs folder, you can also open it through the setting in the app

Thanks.. I was successfully able to add   Shiba to the wallet... I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs possible to hold shiba token on the wallet? Can I transfer shiba funds to this wallet? What will be the process to follow in order to successfully transfer the funds?


[14-May-21 09:46 AM] g59#6881

After more than 6 hours the swap failed & the auto-refund process started. How long does the refunding process take? Now it's been about 1h since it started.


[14-May-21 10:42 AM] Slyris#2880
Sure you can


[14-May-21 10:42 AM] Slyris#2880
I was thinking about listing Shiba too


[14-May-21 10:51 AM] g59#6881
I don‚Äôt see the charts being updated


[14-May-21 11:13 AM] Slyris#2880
Which one ?


[14-May-21 11:21 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
Ok, I found it in the JSON file: {"type":"MakerPaymentWaitRefundStarted","data":{"wait_until":1621050513}}  Does it mean that I need to wait for refund till 1621050513? Is it the exact time of refund?


[14-May-21 11:24 AM] cipi#4502
yes... the time depends greatly on the involved coins and their blocktimes and number of confirmations/notarization settings


[14-May-21 11:28 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
So, this is the exact time of refund and I have to keep the atomicDex opened untill that time? Am I correct?@cipi


[14-May-21 11:32 AM] cipi#4502
yes, it's the exact time... you don't need to keep it open... you can shut down and start again later, it will refund if the timestamp has passed


[14-May-21 11:41 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
So, I can ignore  "Your swap failed but the auto-refund process for your payment started already. Please wait and keep application opened until you receive your payment back" and close atomic?


[14-May-21 11:55 AM] g59#6881
Once I added the shiba coin and I look at the wallet price charts.. I don‚Äôt see any display info. ‚ÄúThere is no charts data for this ticket yet.‚Äù


[14-May-21 11:57 AM] cipi#4502
yes, if the swap is already in refund stage you can close app and reopen later, like in 10h or so... if the time passed, refund will start right after you start the app

[15-May-21 07:46 AM] cipi#4502
sounds like an outdated version that still has the bug where it waits forever for a refund


[15-May-21 07:47 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
"gui": "AtomicDex Desktop 0.4.2-beta",
  "mm_version": "2.1.3355_mm2.1_2adfc3625_Linux_Release",


[15-May-21 07:49 AM] cipi#4502
idk in which mm2 version it was fixed, using the latest is best: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/releases


[15-May-21 07:51 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
Ok, but what can I do to recover the funds? Are the funds lost??? Btw, i didn't install any specific mm version, I just downloaded atomicdex-desktop-0.4.2-beta-linux.AppImage. @cipi


[15-May-21 08:07 AM] cipi#4502
shoudl happen automagically as soon as mm2 starts up... so you need to start, login and enable the involved coins...


[15-May-21 08:09 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
Sorry, but I do not get it. What do I need to start?


[15-May-21 08:11 AM] cipi#4502
start AtomicDEX GUI, login, enable all involved coins in the swap


[15-May-21 08:13 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
AtomicDex is running all the time, I am logged in and the coins are enabled. Do you mean that I should close it and start it again?


[15-May-21 08:13 AM] cipi#4502
you can try it... if i remember right, this was a workaround for the bug


[15-May-21 08:14 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
Ok, I will try


[15-May-21 08:22 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
I logged in again. There is a notification: refunding->swap failed & button "recover funds".


[15-May-21 08:22 AM] cipi#4502

[15-May-21 08:26 AM] cipi#4502
related to the irregular blocks... you will need to wait longer and simply click "recover funds" later again... till it works


[15-May-21 08:27 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
Ok, thanks, I will be trying. @cipi


[15-May-21 09:01 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
As I understand it - the transaction is "non-final", that means it can't get into mempool because there is nLockTime set. Is there a way to  check the value of the nlockTime? @cipi


[15-May-21 09:27 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
@cipi Thank you very much for your help. üëç  The funds have been recovered.  I have two more questions: 1. How to avoid that kind of problems in the future? 2. Is it possible that swap fails and the funds are not recoverable?


[15-May-21 09:34 AM] cipi#4502
the funds will always be recoverable, one way or the other
the problem in this case is: mm2 sets locktime based on a blocktime of 150s for BTCZ, but if there are holes of 30 minutes or 60 minutes, the calc does not match reality
the only solution to this problem is to make sure that real blocktime is near target blocktime... idk why it fluctuates that much with BTCZ, maybe the diff adjustment algorithm should be changed in BTCZ


[15-May-21 09:49 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
Thanks again. I have learned some new things from this failed swap. üôÇ

It's not listed officialy, but you can use custom coins addition - the list of coins can be checked on dexplorer.io

Just wondering how does 'best orders' window in atomic work? What is the logic behind it?  Sometimes it shows lots of orders, but usually it shows nothing. The refresh button does not seem to work.


[16-May-21 04:35 AM] Slyris#2880
Hey - It's works based on the input volume and the fiat price of the coin you would like to buy/sell, so if you're coins doesn't have a valid fiat price (coingecko / band oracle) then your best orders will be empty


[16-May-21 04:35 AM] Slyris#2880
Some orders that i've made in may with the best orders widget only

[16-May-21 04:36 AM] Slyris#2880
Depends if you are lucky sometimes during big pump and dump there is good arbitrage oportunity with CEX, best orders is a helper to localize them


[16-May-21 04:39 AM] Slyris#2880
The main idea you want to keep in mind when using this widget is the fiat equivalent you get for the swap:

If i sell 500$ worth of KMD and i get 550$ worth of another crypto it's worth, then you can sell this crypto on an other exchange, buy-back the KMD and send the KMD back to atomicdex - would be nice in the future to have some automation in the app for that by using exchange API key


[16-May-21 04:43 AM] Slyris#2880 (pinned)
Small hints: 
- If you're input volume is 0, then you don't need to click on the refresh button - it's will not change anything
- If you change the volume with the slider -> it's updating best orders automatically
- If you're base_coin volume is 0, you will have N/A for indicating the CEX rates, this mean not available
- Best orders that are more than 100% expensive compare to CEX are not shown.
- Orders is ordered by fiat price (How much i can get against how much i send)
- Be carefull there is lot of best orders with low liquidity coins, and this can be a trapped often if you are not able to sell them on an exchange or atomicdex

I was just curious if there have been any discussion around adding a proxy network setting to atomicDEX? I understand we could run all network traffic through a VPN, but a proxy setting in atomicDEX would increase privacy (including location privacy) and increase local flexibility for those of us that need to work through multiple networks locally.

Heellooo Slyris, and thanks for your answer! (je vois √©galement que tu es francophone üòÄ). Well, on my second day of launching the DEX AppImage, it actually overcame the "enabling assets" steps üòã. But now I'm confronted with 2 doubts: a) how can I adjust the DEX' dimensions to my screen? I only see the last letters of all the options showing up in the left column, hehe, and b) two coins only, KMD and BTC, seem to be listed. Is it always the case, by default?


[16-May-21 09:45 PM] jspook16#3059
There is an Add Asset button to add other coins. Issues could be due to resolution of your screen maybe?

[16-May-21 10:32 PM] [Soundzone NFTs] ijatz La Hojita#9390
Btw, as far as including an ERC-20 is concerned, I had read that it's now feasible without having to previously work on that listing with an AtomicDEX dev, but the lead dev of our project didn't succeed in adding our token üòã (I guess there's maybe a more suitable channel for this specific topic)


[16-May-21 10:39 PM] Slyris#2880

[16-May-21 11:00 PM] Slyris#2880
Yes the coins by default are: KMD, BTC, LTC for AtomicDEX, DOGE, BTC, LTC for DogeDEX. You can enable coins with Enable Assets button - but please be sure to have the minimal screen resolution in order to use the app without any inconvenience - Our front-end devs are also working for smaller screen resolution in the future.

> Batch batch_enable_coins failed. Reason: failed to read HTTP status line

This means timeout, probably electrum of one coin that you want to enabled is not reacheable, you can always go to settings, and click on reset assets configuration to have the initial configuration, and try again later to re-enable your coin

@Slyris Thanks ! I'll try it out again when i'm home and i'll let you know


[17-May-21 07:29 AM] Slyris#2880
It's in the dev branch, are you used to use last dev build, or you want an explanation ?


[17-May-21 09:20 AM] Mason57#9546
@Slyris i'd like an explanation, i'm pretty new to linux, i think i have to re-build everything on my end, right ?


[17-May-21 09:32 AM] Mason57#9546
Alright, i see now. I know how to re-build a program on Windows, but never did it on Linux. Gonna dig a bit and come back here if i'm stuck


[17-May-21 09:35 AM] gcharang#6833
I think slyris meant to ask you to download a unreleased version from github.
1) login/create an account in giyhub
2) visit https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/actions/runs/850204682
3) download the version for your OS


[17-May-21 09:45 AM] Mason57#9546
@gcharang Indeed i got what he said wrong, i've never used Github before, i thought i had to rebuild everything myself. Anyway, it works fine now, thanks again

hello, I was wondering if there is a way to export my trading history in CSV formate?


[17-May-21 12:52 PM] Slyris#2880
Yes -> trading page > history > filter export

I am having an issue where the application crashes..  After some looking, i found it was because I had my fiat settings set to CAD.   After deleting the `.DogeDEX` directory and creating a new wallet.. I set the fiat to ISK and the app threw the same error.

that is because api.openrates.io is down/gone
devs already replaced it with something else: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/commit/efacb4146d96fa7fa5fc04a6e3316f520009fae0
you can download latest build from https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/actions/runs/851359177 with fix in 30 minutes or so

anyone else having an issue where the GUI just simply disappears entirely after opening but the process is still running? Just suddenly happened to me after the wallet running fine for the last few weeks


[17-May-21 09:44 PM] Crumbz#4358
killing and reopening the program don't help


[17-May-21 09:44 PM] Slyris#2880
This is because of the problem above


[17-May-21 09:44 PM] Slyris#2880

Depends, mostly after 14 june, yeah 0.4.3 is only available on GitHub for now, under review by @smkhound and the rest of the team


[18-May-21 11:57 AM] Deleted User#0000
Is it stable enough to use or does it risk my balances?


[18-May-21 12:06 PM] Slyris#2880
It's stable enough to use, and you do not risk your balances, as usual it's a beta so use it carefully


[18-May-21 12:06 PM] Slyris#2880

i didnt get this error again but now i have another problem. after downloading adex ask me to restart adex. I click yes/okey and adex shutdown but it doesnt restart. And i cant find the new path where adex 0.4.3 was downloaded and installed


[19-May-21 01:07 PM] Slyris#2880
Which os ?


[19-May-21 03:18 PM] Chief Crypto#2529
Same. 

Just used the autoupdater, it downloaded, then popped up a Windows Powershell which sat there a bit, then closed. Now, all of my AtomicDex files have a .old extension and I cannot find the new version.


[19-May-21 03:30 PM] Chief Crypto#2529
Solved by just downloading the installer from the website.


[19-May-21 10:39 PM] blackpanther222#0398
Windows


[19-May-21 10:40 PM] blackpanther222#0398
Yeah but this cant be the solution when there is an autoupdater


[19-May-21 11:52 PM] syl#9221
Hello


[19-May-21 11:53 PM] syl#9221
I'm pretty sure the auto-update finished if your powershell prompted and get automatically closed


[19-May-21 11:53 PM] syl#9221
If you still have your old installation can your retry to run the executable and see if it's updated please ?


[19-May-21 11:55 PM] syl#9221
It's installed in the same path as your old version


[19-May-21 11:56 PM] Slyris#2880
Maybe there is a right problem for people that installed in C:// @syl  can you try to use both 0.4.2 installer and standalone zip and let me know if both of them work correctly ?


[19-May-21 11:56 PM] syl#9221
already did

No, a positive fee would mean that you were charged ( deducted from your initial balance )

there is always 100% uptime if you not using electrum servers but that's a more complicated way to use it

I am just saying, claiming 100% is not realistic. 99.9 maybe.

never claimed it was available in GUI. we were always trying to please everybody and our softwares looked very complicated to users. so, with atomicdex-desktop, we focused on what allows most people to use the platform and we are executing ie the best way we can. if you want native mode, you can use the cli for now. maybe atomicdex-desktop will support it in the future . but it is available in mm2 and anyone can build the GUI

[21-May-21 09:12 AM] gcharang#6833
are you saying 99.99% uptime is broken? also, we never had electrum servers go down. not sure what we are arguing here. Atomicdex is a best in class product and it works. any system on the internet can only guarantee less than 100% uptime. but, the native mode atomicdex while complicated to setup for now, does allow you to have 100% uptime.

we are now just focused on the product that can be used by most people and not create a trophy gui that will only be used by atmost 100 people

How to access BEP20 tokens
Ethereum and Ethereum token wallets can only show transactions on the Ethereum network. The "Binance Smart Chain" (BEP20) is not Ethereum and cannot send real ETH or real Ethereum tokens. If you sent any BEP20 transaction to your Ethereum address...

@dswelch51964 If you use Binance, Binance Wallet, CoinEX, Metamask, you should be able to send BNB to atomicdex

[22-May-21 07:54 AM] Slyris#2880
I think @phm87 Already shared some BNB faucet, but i'm not sure if there is some anymore on the net

BSC usually doesn't have that much high fees, few cents only

[22-May-21 09:26 AM] dswelch51964#1917
That worked but way to complex for most people i think.i had to import private key for coinomi wallet, then import atomicdex wallet pirvate key. send from trust wallet to smartchain bnb.

[22-May-21 09:32 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
I think the simple way to convert some BTC to BNB-BEP20 is to register on coinex.com (no KYC, low withdrawal fee) -> deposit BTC -> buy BNB-BEP20 -> withdraw to atomicDex BNB-BEP20 address.

[24-May-21 12:50 AM] CHMEX#0686
for the other party it was good yes for me not so much


[24-May-21 12:50 AM] Slyris#2880
You was maker ?


[24-May-21 12:56 AM] Slyris#2880
Basically let me give the following clarifications for each view:

- Simple trading view -> taker view, pick from best orders at the selected price of the selected order, kill the order if it doesn't match within 30sec
- Pro view -> Hybrid view, try to act as a taker the first 30 second, became a maker if it didn't match, possibility to set a Minimum trading amount in case you became a maker
- Liquidity view -> Act as a maker against stablecoin and basic coins (qtum,bch,ltc) (very experimental) defined a spread and get your orders automatically udpated every N seconds based on your defined spread

@CHMEX let me know if you need more clarifications


[24-May-21 01:00 AM] CHMEX#0686
I entered 1 SN for 15 KMD
I would expect the software picks the 30KMD per SN order - it did the 10 KMD per SN order


[24-May-21 01:05 AM] Slyris#2880
I think you are confusing between the matching engine and the best orders widget, they are not related.

But yeah indeed - the liquidity view should be a solution to the above problem


[24-May-21 01:05 AM] Slyris#2880
It's probably because the pro view start to try to act as a taker during first 30 seconds


[24-May-21 01:08 AM] CHMEX#0686
maybe I'm wrong but if the matching engine doesn't work as one expects it's a bit a gamble no?


[24-May-21 01:10 AM] Slyris#2880
You was buying or selling @CHMEX ?


[24-May-21 01:10 AM] CHMEX#0686
I was selling SN for KMD


[24-May-21 01:10 AM] Slyris#2880
yeah but the problem it's because it's tries to swallow order the first 30 seconds, will add an option to act as a maker in the pro view too


[24-May-21 01:11 AM] Slyris#2880
(from what i understand it's the default behaviour)


[24-May-21 01:11 AM] CHMEX#0686
I expect it to match the Red Order but it did the Blue

Hmm this is not good


[24-May-21 01:12 AM] Slyris#2880
in the simple view this cannot happens, because it's will select the price of the red one by default


[24-May-21 01:12 AM] Slyris#2880
You input your price manually alright ?


[24-May-21 01:12 AM] CHMEX#0686
does it match by UUID or by price?


[24-May-21 01:13 AM] Slyris#2880
by PRICE


[24-May-21 01:13 AM] CHMEX#0686

yeah but not good


[24-May-21 01:13 AM] Slyris#2880
you should use goodtilcancelled


[24-May-21 01:13 AM] Slyris#2880
in this case


[24-May-21 01:14 AM] Slyris#2880
the simple view will be a fill or kill but the things is taht it's only work with selected orders, so this specific case above cannot happen


[24-May-21 01:14 AM] Slyris#2880
because in this case you will select the price 30.0 in the UI


[24-May-21 01:14 AM] Slyris#2880
and it's will be locked

Any Ideas?


[24-May-21 01:49 AM] jansako#3330
I have seen this happen before as well. I thought I even filed it too.

Can't find it on Github so I guess not üò¶


[24-May-21 01:52 AM] gcharang#6833
I think @cipi was tinkering with the BSC nodes to make them work better. maybe the maintainance is ongoing


[24-May-21 01:56 AM] Roger#1320
so I should just wait and try latter  ? As we have lined up a number of users to do a real world test to check all is working.


[24-May-21 02:27 AM] gcharang#6833
yes, please wait and try later. @cipi should give us an update when he is back online


[24-May-21 02:30 AM] Roger#1320
Ok do you think it will be in the next 24 hours as I need to let testing team know as there on hold for now.


[24-May-21 02:43 AM] Slyris#2880
DLP is listed ?


[24-May-21 02:44 AM] Slyris#2880
I do not think this bep20 token is listed yet


[24-May-21 02:47 AM] Roger#1320
no its my custom token


[24-May-21 02:48 AM] Roger#1320
I have added it to my atomicdex wallet as a custom asset  but it is not showing the balance

Hi again I was putting up a swap between KMD and a Bep-20 token and noticed that I am being charged a ETH fee. Is this correct as I am trading from the Komodo platform to the Binance smart chain platform ?


[24-May-21 04:49 AM] cipi#4502
you are charged a BNB fee, not ETH... wher do you see ETH? maybe a display bug...


[24-May-21 08:49 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
Is there a history of all recent swaps (not only mine) in atomicDex? Let's say I would like to see all today's KMD<->BTC swaps.


[24-May-21 08:54 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
Is it possible to place AON (all or nothing) order or just set minimum required amount?

[24-May-21 09:14 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
What about the AON orders?


[24-May-21 10:13 AM] jansako#3330
If you set the minimum order size=your order size, then you get an AON order


[24-May-21 10:13 AM] jansako#3330
It is the 'left' drag-button on the order creation UI

Hello, in the wallet tab is it possible to create segregated accounts for a single token?


[25-May-21 07:21 AM] Slyris#2880
Sorry can you clarify a bit, i'm not sure what do you mean by segregated


[25-May-21 08:09 AM] Matthias#2174
What I would like to do is to have for example my KMD in two separate addresses on AtomixDEX, ideally without having to create another wallet, a bit like the sub-account feature on FTX or Binance.


[25-May-21 08:28 AM] Matthias#2174
Otherwise I will just create a separate wallet


[25-May-21 09:29 AM] gcharang#6833
there's no such feature now. you will have to create a seperate wallet

is it normal not to have any matching orders on BNB

why cant we click chart for our price and have the price be entered and calculated based on the slider volume?

What will this button mean in the future?
what is its role?


[26-May-21 08:45 AM] jansako#3330
It would let you trade against Fiat (currency, not the car). Probably allow deposit/withdrawal to a bank account if the rumors to be believed.

Fiat atomicswap will probably be within the trading view on a specific page

@TopDeckPro do you have swap ongoing?

If you input 0 as amount, yes you cannot withdraw 0 to another address, otherwise maybe you have funds lock in swaps atm

@Slyris any idea why this atomicdex desktop trx doesnt confirm? Fee too low is my best guess


[27-May-21 11:36 AM] Slyris#2880

sounds like virus scanner that has quarantined or removed `mm2.exe` binary needed by ADEX Desktop

I got a question about backups in atomic.  Is it enough to make a copy of   .atomic_qt/config/wallet.seed  file to backup a wallet?


[31-May-21 07:39 AM] Slyris#2880
@Jupiter&Mars Yes it's enough - the good things is that you can also use this backup in other wallet like DogeDex or others, i think you also need your .json in `exports` folder if you want your transactions notes, if you need your raw private keys/seed, you can get them in the settings too.


[31-May-21 07:47 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
That's nice. I assume that the wallet.seed file is password protected (encrypted) so for me it is a bit safer form of backup than 24 words mnemonic seed.@Slyris


[31-May-21 08:04 AM] Slyris#2880
yes it is

Hey there, I have installed atomicDEX it really seems like a cool program but I cannot seem to use the DEX part, when I hover my mouse on it it says CA address not supported or something. Will this restriction for canadian IP be removed sometime? whats up with that?


[01-Jun-21 12:14 PM] Slyris#2880
If you are familiar with GitHub you can use the last version of dogedex, gleecdex or even marmara chain version which doesn't contains the restrictions


[01-Jun-21 12:20 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Or a vpn


[01-Jun-21 01:11 PM] stnabben#4667
I don't understand why the restrictions are still active? It has been said that they would be removed. As of now this only hinders adoption and many, including myself, are not interested in using a vpn.


[01-Jun-21 01:12 PM] Slyris#2880
I didn't mention any VPN in my proposition if you look carefully


[01-Jun-21 01:21 PM] stnabben#4667
I don't see it as an alternative to recommend other branded dexes. I belive Komodo should only market their own. Recommending other branded dexes to every person who comes in this Discord asking why aDEX is geoblocked is not a good strategy imo.


[01-Jun-21 01:25 PM] Slyris#2880
What I'm saying is that's a personal opinion, there is currently a way for you to use the dex, the project is still in beta testing. We told that we will remove it, please be patient.


[01-Jun-21 03:32 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@stnabben at the same time they are all Komodos dex

Its uses the password manager of your os - try to send after enable it you will understand


[02-Jun-21 10:54 AM] gabbawoot#7567
hi @Slyris thank you Ill check to install it from github later. Could you please send me the link to the repo to use and also let me know what branch I need?


[02-Jun-21 10:57 AM] gabbawoot#7567
ok so atomicdex from komodo does not allow canadian ips but dogedex does?? is that the same program I never heard of those before


[02-Jun-21 10:58 AM] gabbawoot#7567
ok I am checking the site for dogedex and I can see its the same layout... is it like doge ppl who just made a branch of atomicdex or what?


[02-Jun-21 10:59 AM] gabbawoot#7567
I am guessing I can share the same wallet on dogedex and atomicdex?


[02-Jun-21 11:03 AM] Slyris#2880
You absolutely can, you can also use a geofree version like marmara chain or @cipi repo


[02-Jun-21 11:06 AM] gabbawoot#7567
@Slyris is there a version that allows canadian ips and has support for pirate chain by any chance?


[02-Jun-21 11:30 AM] Slyris#2880
Pirate chain is not integrated yet in the GUI


[02-Jun-21 11:30 AM] Slyris#2880
Every version except official AtomicDEX accept Canadian ips

[05-Jun-21 01:38 AM] Pumtchak#0362
I'd like to address a concern about a poor UX in ADEX... Sometimes when i click a buy order and start swap, the swap fail and is converted into a maker order. First, i have no clue why this appended, there is no explanation at all, and if i am not paying attention i don't even notive it have failed and is now a maker order... It appended to me personaly to wait 1 hour before noticing...


[05-Jun-21 01:40 AM] Pumtchak#0362
i can only imagine that a new user to Adex would think something like "lame, this adex thing dont work, back to CEX..."


[05-Jun-21 01:41 AM] Pumtchak#0362
This issue what present in early version but apparently still is...


[05-Jun-21 01:43 AM] Pumtchak#0362
Is someone aware of this behavior and have it been already adressed by dev ?


[05-Jun-21 01:43 AM] Pumtchak#0362
Maybe it have been discused before... in that case i apologize ‚ò∫Ô∏è


[05-Jun-21 02:31 AM] jansako#3330
This has always been the default behavior. It is a matter of design choice. The failed order and converting to a maker order are two different things. If your order matches & fails that is one thing. I believe what you are seeing is that an order is placed and not matched, in which case it becomes a maker order & sits on the books until someone else takes it.


[05-Jun-21 02:32 AM] jansako#3330
This could be addressed in different ways, but the 'workflows' would have to be redesigned based on use cases. In this case 'workflow' means what does a user need to click to get a certain result and how clear it is to the user that they are progressing towards this result.


[05-Jun-21 02:33 AM] jansako#3330

[06-Jun-21 04:42 AM] smkhound#7640
my guess would be either the maker is on an old version, or trade value vs fees is rejecting the tx


[06-Jun-21 06:04 AM] Pumtchak#0362
trade value is far above tx fee in this case


[06-Jun-21 06:40 AM] TonyL#3577
another reason might be a ban by maker (if there was failed swap with this maker your pubkey is in his ban list until api restart on his side)


[06-Jun-21 07:42 AM] Pumtchak#0362
highly unlikely imho (not swapping much lately)

VRSC/BTC asks have a min_volume of 0.008xx BTC atm


[06-Jun-21 02:49 PM] cipi#4502
there are several potential reasons for not matching
- min_volume does not match
- price does not match (prices change, so if you post your order after price increased, it will not match)
- clock of maker or taker differs > 60s from real time (this normally leads to a failed swap though)
- banning after a failed swap (ban must be removed manually or by restart)


[06-Jun-21 08:01 PM] roarde#0976
Who gets the taker-fee?


[06-Jun-21 10:48 PM] blackpanther222#0398

@cipi thx


[06-Jun-21 11:31 PM] Pumtchak#0362
volume is 10 times min_volume in this case


[06-Jun-21 11:32 PM] Pumtchak#0362
i understand there is much reason for a swap to fail, but my point is it is a bad UX to silently convert a fail swap to a maker order ...


[06-Jun-21 11:33 PM] Pumtchak#0362
as i want to take the order i see, not create a new one,  with the same exact price ...


[07-Jun-21 12:27 AM] Slyris#2880
Every exchange have a maker order creation by default if it's not matched - however, the new simple trading view is `FillOrKill` by default, i don't think see this debate make that much sense https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/issues/956 - `GoodTilCancelled` will be default beahviour for pro view, but we will make sure that you can choose your order type on this view in the future, now regarding you matching order:

- If you selected an order from the orderbook, and wait too much before starting the swap the price may have changed and then you will not be able to match this order
- We cannot silently update the price of your selected order, could be too dangerous.
- Pro view use `GoodTilCancelled` by default
- Simple view use `FillOrKill` by default
- If you select an order, and change a bit the price, you will likely not match it
- If you select an order you cannot ask more volume than the selected order, otherwise you will not match it
- If the order you selected is partially filled, you have no way to know that, and you will likely not match it either if your current volume is > available volume for the selected order
- You cannot swallow multiple orders by putting a higher price, you will just match the best price in this case
- If the selected order is cancelled by the maker, you have no way to know that either currently in the UI, so you will not match this order either


[07-Jun-21 12:35 AM] Slyris#2880
In the mechanisms I mentioned, there are already several solutions being considered, such as a notification that would warn you that the price/volume/order_status is changed between the moment you select the order and the moment you wish to execute it.


[07-Jun-21 12:39 AM] Slyris#2880
To give you an example, currently you are selecting an order, you are going to make yourself a coffee, you come back, there is a great chance that the selected order has changed its price, its available volume or even canceled its order. And so therefore it is no longer possible to match this order


[07-Jun-21 01:03 AM] Pumtchak#0362
I select an order, one second later i click on Start Swap. no change in the price, nor volume. i just expect it to fill, or explicilty fail. not to make an new maker order...


[07-Jun-21 01:04 AM] Pumtchak#0362
maybe it's just me, but it's frustrating to see this order i can't fill üòÖ

[07-Jun-21 01:06 AM] Slyris#2880
Maybe you must be very unhappy not to match this order, it seems weird to me, but I would have to check that, maybe add more log between the selected order and the validated price before placing the order


[07-Jun-21 01:07 AM] Pumtchak#0362
not particulaly unhappy, it's just this behavior happend to me several times and i find it very frustrating

[07-Jun-21 05:07 AM] cipi#4502
which particular order is that? sounds like another problem, eg with the maker node of this order... maybe it can't start any swap, not just yours

hey all, I have a quick noob question... I'm posting an order for DOGE/KMD and was thinking that if someone takes part of my order, does the dex automatically split the coins in my wallets into smaller amounts? is there an optimum size I should post instead of all the coins together?

[09-Jun-21 02:45 AM] shokker#4105
it's not an issue for this order, but I was wondering if I used DOGE/BTC instead of KMD


[09-Jun-21 02:51 AM] gcharang#6833
afaik, it doesn't do any preemptive splits. it should use the available utxos in an optimal way and create txns with the necessary outputs when needed. for more info on how utxos are handled, you can ask in the #dev-marketmaker channel

@cipi can this ^ happen if the coins are not present in the main coins file (i.e., seed nodes don't know them)? https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins/blob/master/coins


[10-Jun-21 06:41 AM] Roger#1320
so what is the solution ?


[10-Jun-21 06:42 AM] Roger#1320
As not much point in allow to add customs coins if you cant create swaps ?


[10-Jun-21 06:44 AM] gcharang#6833

[10-Jun-21 06:51 AM] cipi#4502
only orderbook in https://stats-api.atomicdex.io/api/v1/orderbook/DGB_KMD is missing when coin not in seed node config, but normal orderbook works fine, else no new coins could be tested
when orders not visible in orderbook anymore, it's usually a sign that the node has banned the other node because of a failed swap

`curl -s --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"list_banned_pubkeys\"}"` shows banned pubkeys


[10-Jun-21 07:11 AM] Roger#1320
It looks like your saying if someone tried to do a swap and for some reason it failed, that the remaining swaps on the order book will be removed.


[10-Jun-21 07:12 AM] Roger#1320
So should I try again ?


[10-Jun-21 07:36 AM] cipi#4502
yes, orders from banned nodes are not visible in orderbook any more
you can restart your ADEX, then it will remove the ban... the other node may still ban you though, depends on what happened... simply try again after you restarted your own node


[10-Jun-21 07:47 AM] Roger#1320
still looks the same the orders are there sometimes and sometimes there not, and when I place a swap thats there is does not go through.


[10-Jun-21 07:53 AM] cipi#4502
if the other node banned you, but you haven't banned the other node, then orders from that node are visible in your orderbook, but can't be matched by you


[10-Jun-21 07:54 AM] Roger#1320
So i delete all and start again ?


[10-Jun-21 07:54 AM] cipi#4502
who controls the nodes you are using for the swaps? is it all your nodes?


[10-Jun-21 07:55 AM] Roger#1320
I am am not a developer just a user atomicdex and have no idea


[10-Jun-21 07:55 AM] Roger#1320
about nodes


[10-Jun-21 07:55 AM] cipi#4502
bans can only be removed by restarting mm2 or by calling `curl -s --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"unban_pubkeys\",\"unban_by\":{\"type\":\"All\"}}"`
so if you don't control the other node, then you can't get rid of an eventual ban


[10-Jun-21 07:56 AM] cipi#4502
node = ADEX


[10-Jun-21 07:56 AM] Roger#1320
so I have to wallets on my mac if i delete from both all  should be ok


[10-Jun-21 07:57 AM] cipi#4502
what wallets? you mean AtomicDEX?


[10-Jun-21 07:57 AM] Roger#1320
yes


[10-Jun-21 07:58 AM] cipi#4502
if you restart that ADEX, it will remove the ban... but the other ADEX you have failed a swap with still bans you


[10-Jun-21 07:58 AM] Roger#1320
so how do i remove that ?


[10-Jun-21 07:58 AM] cipi#4502
ask the person who runs that ADEX to restart too or to call `unban_pubkeys`


[10-Jun-21 07:59 AM] Roger#1320
there both my ADEX  on the same mac


[10-Jun-21 08:00 AM] cipi#4502
that was what i was asking for... if you control both nodes that you use for your testing...
restart both ADEX and the ban will be gone, yes


[10-Jun-21 08:00 AM] Roger#1320
ok i did that but still the same.


[10-Jun-21 08:00 AM] cipi#4502
then it's not the banning


[10-Jun-21 08:01 AM] Roger#1320
so maybe I should delete all swaps and start again


[10-Jun-21 08:02 AM] cipi#4502
don't know what you mean with "delete all swaps"
btw, only saw the problem with disappearing orderbook entries on a node with 5000 orders... that was too much and it dropped connections
no other problems with disappearing entries seen so far

[10-Jun-21 08:22 AM] Roger#1320
ok i delated all  orderbook entries and added new ones and then used aa different ADEX to find the orders and place orders for them, but it seams to be stuck at that point.


[10-Jun-21 08:25 AM] Roger#1320
Maybe there is not enough funds for fees etc but nothing telling me there is a problem just orders not going through .


[10-Jun-21 08:37 AM] cipi#4502
the order is only active as long as your ADEX runs... if you stop it or logout, it will disappear from orderbook after a short time
if it's still visible and you try to match it, it will not, instead creating a new order after 10s or so


[10-Jun-21 09:08 AM] Roger#1320
ah I see so need to leave ADEX running 24/7


[10-Jun-21 09:18 AM] cipi#4502
yes


[10-Jun-21 09:19 AM] cipi#4502
if it should do swaps... if you stop and restart later, it will repost the orders it had before, but as long as it's stopped, it will not do any trades/swaps... it's all p2p, so the 2 trading parties need to be able to talk to each other


[10-Jun-21 09:39 AM] Roger#1320
I understand now Ops sorry


[10-Jun-21 09:40 AM] Roger#1320
so to leave a orderbook open all the time you might need to run VM


[10-Jun-21 12:17 PM] cipi#4502
you can  also let the GUI running on your PC

thank you

the current version of atomicdex will continue to work after the hardfork as the necessary SPV servers are updated


[13-Jun-21 04:39 AM] find_your_way#5266
perfect..so the current version is 0.4.3?

Is v0.4.2 going to work too? I mean after the hardfork.


[13-Jun-21 08:04 AM] cipi#4502
why would you want to use an old version?


[13-Jun-21 08:51 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
because
`üòû disable wallet charts`
maybe?


[13-Jun-21 09:43 AM] Slyris#2880
They will be removed for 0.5.0 since they are marked as wip atm


[14-Jun-21 05:46 AM] Roger#1320
@cipi Ok so we have been do some live testing and have some observations.

If you need to leave a swap on your order book 24/7 for an extended period there is an issue where you need to interact with your ADEX or it freezes.  Also how safe would it to be to leave your ADEX open 24/7 ref: hacks etc. Does the browser version coming soon help in this area? Any thoughts.


[14-Jun-21 08:30 AM] cipi#4502
what do you mean by freezing? Does the app not respond any more?
regarding safety: it is as safe as the PC where it runs... if that is compromised (eg keylogger trojan or something) anything is possible... the easiest way to make your PC much more secure it to use Linux instead of Windows... but anyway, not related to the app, but to the OS and your environment... eg if you are behind NAT, no connections from outside possible as long as you don't explicitly configure a port forwarding in your router

seems to work fine atm


[14-Jun-21 11:07 AM] Roger#1320
Yes after maybe 2 hours. I have to logout and back in to get it to wakeup


[14-Jun-21 11:55 AM] cipi#4502
i had this too once, but the problem disappeared in one of the latest builds


[14-Jun-21 11:55 AM] cipi#4502
my ADEX Desktop is now running since days and with couple of active orders... still responding fine... so i guess whatever the problem was, it's gone

What do i start with if i haven't used atomicdex for pc? I tried 0.4.3. It wont let me finsh the wallet start


[16-Jun-21 08:41 PM] gcharang#6833
you can check if your antivirus or filewall have quarantined atomicdex/mm2


[16-Jun-21 09:00 PM] AllSeezen#9443
Thanks, ill check that


[17-Jun-21 02:19 AM] ≈ûehoy#1450
Can anyone buy from this? I tried  with desktop and mobile. It is not working. How long will it stay there? I think if it cannot be fulfilled, it should not stay there.

a swap is now ongoing for 55min both atomicdex wallets are open so any ideas why its stuck at 2/3


[17-Jun-21 04:05 AM] cipi#4502
check explorer... it's likely waiting for tx confirmations

is it possible to implement a 2FA on Adex for login and withdraw?...for example google Authenticator or Code per Mail?


[18-Jun-21 11:53 PM] Slyris#2880
There is already a 2fa on withdraw @find_your_way


[18-Jun-21 11:56 PM] find_your_way#5266
mhh.didnt find it...i try it and send 10 kmd to another walet but no 2FA


[18-Jun-21 11:57 PM] find_your_way#5266
ah ok...i have to switch 2FA on in settings


[18-Jun-21 11:57 PM] find_your_way#5266
but this is just to enter password..what if password is hacked?


[18-Jun-21 11:58 PM] find_your_way#5266
a code per Mail or sms or google authenticator code would be more secure or not?


[19-Jun-21 12:00 AM] find_your_way#5266
i try to send 10kmd again with 2FA but there was no ask for password..it seems that it doesnt work to me


[19-Jun-21 12:16 AM] Slyris#2880
Not, this is the opposite of the DEX idea, would you use a centralized service to secure your DEX withdraw ?

Yeah there is some bugs with 2FA on windows, @syl is already aware of that


[19-Jun-21 12:17 AM] Slyris#2880
The password of AtomicDEX should be different from your system one, if you cannot trust your password in your computer this means there is a problem :/

In this case an hacker would need: Your wallet password + Your computer password, if it's the case you probably are infected on your computer


[19-Jun-21 12:19 AM] Slyris#2880
The only things i can see would be a 2FA with something like YubiKey or so, this means through the hardware, let's forget about google authenticator/mail code

What can be planned in the future is a confirmation of transaction withdraw on an hardware wallet for example Ledger/Trezor


[19-Jun-21 01:40 AM] find_your_way#5266
i didnt realize that system password is needed..i thought its the same as adex passwort...so i am fine with it üôÇ i hope the bug with 2FA on windows will be updated in next version. Thank you

I believe its for the BTC transaction fee ....... just as it you were going to send it to another address


[19-Jun-21 01:57 PM] find_your_way#5266
for the highest order at 0.000048.. i dont need this minimum amount


[19-Jun-21 02:01 PM] cipi#4502
the user who posted the order has set it... likely because of high txfees on BTC chain... to not pay 50% of the swapped amount as txfee


[19-Jun-21 02:02 PM] cipi#4502
you can post your own order without min_volume

yes i have plentyh of eth but it asks for a mixed address or something like that when i try to send


[21-Jun-21 05:30 AM] Slyris#2880

btw im geoblocked for atomic dex thats why i use dogedex


[21-Jun-21 05:30 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah i confirm fixed case is fixed in the version linked above


[21-Jun-21 05:30 AM] Slyris#2880
send me your eth address i can show you a demo


[21-Jun-21 05:31 AM] c2k#6034
mind taking it to DM?


[21-Jun-21 05:32 AM] Slyris#2880
sure


[21-Jun-21 06:15 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
Yeah, but why is that note about fixing the address? Is lowercase BEP20 address incorrect that it needs fixing?


[21-Jun-21 06:17 AM] cipi#4502
lower case addresses can't be checked (checksum), to see if they are correct or not
the mixed case ones can


[21-Jun-21 06:18 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
When using Binance Bridge bep20->bep2  I get lowercase address as a deposit bep20 address.


[21-Jun-21 06:19 AM] cipi#4502
so: CEXes that don't support mixed case addresses are giving away security, because the user can input invalid addresses...


[21-Jun-21 06:23 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
I think they support mixed case addresses. When using Binance Wallet to send bep20 token the deposit address (also bep20) is being automatically converted to mixed case.


[21-Jun-21 06:24 AM] cipi#4502
sure, the addresses are the same... by "supporting" i meant they should show the addresses in mixed case format all the time, eg the deposit address


[21-Jun-21 06:26 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
If addresses are the same (the same private key) then why did you implement that 'fix' button. It suggests that something is wrong with pasted deposit address & it needs fixing.


[21-Jun-21 06:31 AM] cipi#4502
idk that button... i guess user convenience... ADEX only accepts mixed case addresses, so those lower case ones need to be converted


[21-Jun-21 06:32 AM] Slyris#2880
@Jupiter&Mars I believe you are not on the last version ?


[21-Jun-21 06:32 AM] Slyris#2880
Because we have a button to fix address in the last dev branch

Yeah but there is dev improvement including this fix button

now it give better explanation please forward your eth address i can show you


[21-Jun-21 06:35 AM] Slyris#2880
And yes according to https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-55.md using a lowercase address is not authorized, we are a DEX, we follow official convention


[21-Jun-21 06:37 AM] Slyris#2880
and other cases are handled too

"swap is not recoverable" means there is nothing to recover, eg because no funds were sent

no. i think i pinned it in trading channel. will give it a shot.

Atomic wallet is using a 3rd party for the swap. Once you make the exchange on atomic wallet you are giving up ownership of your private keys and are subject to possible theft or loss... With atomicdex you are using atomic swap technology and you never give up your keys... Atomic wallet does not use atomic swap technology they are basically using a service like changelly

restarting the openethereum nodes now one after the other... then nonce will be equal on all... for the start... we will see what happens later


[28-Jun-21 08:57 AM] cipi#4502
there is no refund, if not even takerfee was seint... takerfee sent is the first step in an atomic swap, the first ones that involves sending a tx


[28-Jun-21 08:58 AM] find_your_way#5266

[28-Jun-21 09:04 AM] cipi#4502
sure, people don't want to pay 50% of the transferred amount as txfee on the ETH chain
i recommned you to use ETH-BEP20 instead of ETH anyway, it costs only 1/20 of the txfees on the ETH chain atm... difference could be much more though
https://etherscan.io/gastracker
txfees on BEP20 are 0.10 or even 0.05, idk for sure

[28-Jun-21 09:12 AM] find_your_way#5266
so my idea was to send it from ETH ADEX Adress to ETH-bep20 Adex Adress

that doesn't work, those are 2 different chains

for "my" amount of kmd i have entered above?


[29-Jun-21 07:11 AM] Slyris#2880
It's the available quantity in KMD for this order


[29-Jun-21 07:12 AM] Mylo#8306
yes, i can read üòõ
but what does that actually mean?


[29-Jun-21 07:12 AM] gcharang#6833
I think it means the amount of KMD that can be used to buy all the available coins(EMC2, UNO, THC) etc


[29-Jun-21 07:13 AM] Mylo#8306
my swap amount of 5 kmd will get me 822 emc2 or 28 uno or 1.29 thc?


[29-Jun-21 07:13 AM] Mylo#8306
or the available quantity from my entire balance of kmd (806.52195636)?


[29-Jun-21 07:15 AM] Mylo#8306
columns maybe better labeled as:
total available, swap amount


[29-Jun-21 07:16 AM] Mylo#8306
is "fiat volume" the available quantity, or the swap amount in fiat value?


[29-Jun-21 07:21 AM] Slyris#2880
If your max tradeable amount > the quantity in the order, you will be capped to the available quantity of the order


[29-Jun-21 07:21 AM] Slyris#2880
since it's works with orderbook


[29-Jun-21 07:21 AM] Slyris#2880
you have to respect the order


[29-Jun-21 07:22 AM] Slyris#2880
so it indicate to the user if he can "swallow" the order, or only have a partial volume of what he would like to sell


[29-Jun-21 07:22 AM] Slyris#2880
if you want to sell 400 KMD, you may find interesting orders that have an equivalent of less than 400 KMD, but you may still want to match them


[29-Jun-21 07:24 AM] Slyris#2880
In the above screen user want to sell 5 KMD (3$), Fiat volume represent what he will get for those 5 KMD, here 10.11$ for the EMC2 order.


[29-Jun-21 07:24 AM] Slyris#2880
so you basically swap 3$ for 10.11$ in this one, but be carefull about that, small coins manipulate price a lot due to low liquidity


[29-Jun-21 07:39 AM] Mylo#8306
Ok. I get the fiat. Thanks

Im using an old mac on 10.13.6(high Sierra)
Too sad that AtomicDEX can only install above 10.14(Mojave)
Is that true?? No way for old mac users?

If you want support for high Sierra you will need to compile the project manually on your computer

Looking at AtomicDEX API docs and everything needs `userpass` where can I find this? and can I also access it/use it while AtomicDEX Desktop is running?


[29-Jun-21 03:23 PM] cipi#4502
Settings -> Security -> View seed and private keys
there is a userpass... you can use it to talk to the running mm2 started by Desktop GUI

[30-Jun-21 04:06 PM] cipi#4502
question is: was a tx sent out on the ETH chain or not? if a tx was sent out that is stuck because of too low gas, then you can't send a new tx out, it will also get stuck till the first one is confirmed... that is ETH chain...
you can try to restart app


[30-Jun-21 04:11 PM] cipi#4502
you could also use ETH-BEP20 instead of ETH üòâ
the principle on the BEP20 chain is likely the same, the difference is though that txes don't get stuck because gas price doesn't change

[04-Jul-21 05:11 PM] RadioactiveKomododragon#6470
I'm having some issues with Atomic DEX desktop, wondering if there is a resolution for this? Maybe someone else has the same problem? What happened is that I have one wallet where the symbol ¬£ is part of the password, but Atomic DEX is now refusing to let me write this and/or copy and paste it into the password field, so I can't log into that wallet because it refuses me to type the symbol. There's another wallet with the symbol $ in the password, where Atomic DEX will accept the symbol when I turn on to see what's written in the password field, but it just tells me "wrong password entered" , even though I know I am writing it correctly. Why have these symbols stopped working? They used to work just fine before and now I can't log into certain wallets.... There might be issues with more symbols than just these, but those are the two I found so far and I have no idea why the wallet is doing this. It is not my keyboard either, because I can write whatever I want into notepad or whatever.


[04-Jul-21 08:30 PM] TonyL#3577
Hello @RadioactiveKomododragon 
Can confirm `¬£` symbol input into password field doesn't work with 0.4.3 version under MacOS. Do you remember on which version this symbol was accepted? (just checked versions from 0.4.3 to 0.4.0, not able to use pound symbol)


[04-Jul-21 09:35 PM] Slyris#2880
Yes pound symbol is not accepted as a symbol because it's not a part of the regex password policy - i can add it, i remember I add another one recently

This mean you need to enable bnb or eth based on the coin you trade

[05-Jul-21 03:50 AM] RadioactiveKomododragon#6470
I am on Windows, using 0.4.3 Beta. The wallet that was created with the ¬£ pound symbol was a relatively new one. The first transaction on that wallet was made 22nd of June 2021 and the wallet was created that day or the day before. So I am fairly sure my version was upgraded to 0.4.3 Beta long prior to this issue. It worked to create it late June 21-22nd sometime, I could log in for a couple of weeks, but I can't remember the exact day it stopped working, but it is very recent. 1-3 days before I finally decided to join the Discord and post that first message is when it stopped working. The other wallet I am having problems with, that has the $ symbol is an even newer wallet, it is a week old or so where I could log into that one at first, but it does not work anymore now either. In case of the $ it at least lets me type that in the field, but it still tells me "wrong password". As for the ¬£ , it just refuses to let me type it in at all.


[05-Jul-21 03:55 AM] Slyris#2880
The bug is that the wallet creation was not using any regex policy, allowing you to type any password that's why you was able to create such wallet but normally you can't


[05-Jul-21 03:59 AM] RadioactiveKomododragon#6470
OK, so what do people do who created wallets like that, then? Right now, I can not access anything. There was one post the ¬£ symbol was added, but do I reinstall and recover my wallet then or what? Or wait for the next version update? Also, is it possible to restore an Atomic DEX wallet as a different wallet, such as a Ledger using the 24 word phrase? I mean, is there any way to get around the password issue that way to access funds, or does an Atomic DEX wallet created with a password, have to be restored with that same password in addition to the 24 words?


[05-Jul-21 03:59 AM] Slyris#2880

[05-Jul-21 04:20 AM] RadioactiveKomododragon#6470
Thanks, that is very good to know. Just had to create a GitHub account, downloading now, so we shall see how this fares.


[05-Jul-21 04:21 AM] Slyris#2880
The password is used to encrypt your seed locally so it's not visible by anyone except you, and only your password can decrypt it, but if you know you're seed that's always fine, can always restore with a different password

You've just experienced a bad UX due to a too permissive password allowance


[05-Jul-21 04:36 AM] RadioactiveKomododragon#6470
Thanks again for explaining. I'm done downloading from GitHub and I have tried it. Created a desktop shortcut. Remember how I said I suddenly had problems with 2 wallets? One with ¬£ and the other with $ in the password. So, now it lets me type in ¬£ in the text field. It appears to recognize the correct length of the password, because the login button becomes clickable after I have typed the password. However, for the wallet with ¬£ I still get the incorrect password message, it does not let me log in, even though I have typed it correctly. Now, the other wallet with $ in the password that also stopped working, after the download at least that one works now. Before, that one too gave me the incorrect password error, even though I know I had typed it correctly, I had the password visible and triple checked. So this fixed one wallet at least...


[05-Jul-21 04:38 AM] Slyris#2880
I've just added the ¬£ sign support, if it's says incorrect password it's for sure not part of the password, or typed it incorrectly somehow, please try to restore the wallet with `¬£` inside and it's should work like a charm !


[05-Jul-21 04:38 AM] Slyris#2880
(maybe you've misspositionned it)


[05-Jul-21 04:39 AM] Slyris#2880
(or maybe during the creation it didn't encrypt it with the current character which lead to a wrong password, but now both step should work after restoring the wallet)


[05-Jul-21 04:45 AM] Slyris#2880
Recently i've helped a user that thought he noted correctly his password, but he forget a uppercase letter and use a lowercase instead, of course he was sure that he typed it correctly, that's why i really suggest to always double-check


[05-Jul-21 04:46 AM] Slyris#2880
a single letter diff or case sensitive may lead to a wrong password.


[05-Jul-21 04:49 AM] RadioactiveKomododragon#6470
There's some weird stuff going on with my installation, or something. I still can't get into the wallet with the ¬£ in the password. But now, let's talk about the wallet with the $ in the password, because this is interesting. I start Atomic Dex fresh, from the list of the wallet I select the one with $ in the password. It works to log in. When I am in that one, using the log out function to get back to the list of wallets, then trying to log into the same one again with the same password (I am not typing it wrong, believe me) it tells me "wrong password". If I exit the thing, then restart, I can log in. If I have been into another wallet, log out of that, then try to log into the one with the $ password, it does not work. This is really weird. I can get into it with the same password from a fresh boot of Atomic DEX, but not after having it open and having been between wallets. OK, so can I delete a wallet inside of Atomic DEX to then restore it to try that for the ¬£ one?


[05-Jul-21 04:50 AM] Slyris#2880
I will check shortly - yes you can delete the wallet with ¬£ or restore it with another name without deleting it üôÇ

[05-Jul-21 05:06 AM] RadioactiveKomododragon#6470
I saw the video, was wondering what the deal with custom seed was? Now, what I did, was that I restored the problematic ¬£ wallet and just named it the exact same but with -Recovery at the end. I restored from seed, not custom, and gave the Recovery-wallet the exact same, ¬£ password as the one I can't get into. Well, I can indeed log into the recovered wallet, so my day is saved. Thanks. Now we know recovery works and we know it works to recover/create a new wallet with ¬£ in the password.


[05-Jul-21 05:06 AM] Slyris#2880

[05-Jul-21 05:08 AM] RadioactiveKomododragon#6470
I'm not too savvy on videos, haven't done that before. Another thing, how do I delete a wallet from the list? Can't find a delete button there, does not work to press delete on the keyboard. If the only way to delete a wallet is from having logged into it, well, can't delete a wallet it is not possible to log into then.

hi all. have some UX advice to your mac desktop client of atomicdex. by default the chart looks like this http://joxi.ru/E2pVLzJu7KlBJr.jpg
the only way to see the chart is to collapse the order book & the options block.  this is kinda strange.
my offer is to make these blocks resizable and allow scrolling on the "DEX" screen

@B. G√ºltekin √áetiner I downloaded the marmara Adex but it seems that it is the same like my normal kmd adex. I try to add the DEX Asset but it was not found. Can you help me please?

any chance on appimage being built with linux "standard" libs instead of whatever Ubuntu decided to cram out this month?


[09-Jul-21 08:46 AM] cipi#4502
you can enable DEX in https://github.com/marmarachain/atomicDEX-Desktop/releases/tag/v0.4.3-beta for sure
if not, you need to "reset assets configuration" in "settings" first
or you can use pre 0.5.0 from https://github.com/cipig/atomicDEX-Desktop/actions ... it has DEX too


[09-Jul-21 09:38 AM] Slyris#2880
Unfortunately due to lack of competencies from Qt team we have to build with native libc++ from the system, @smkhound could you please forward the prerequisite.sh for using the last appimage of 0.5.0 ?

[09-Jul-21 09:39 AM] Slyris#2880
(they break compatibility with libc++ from clang, so we have to use libstdc++ and unfortunately this lib is blacklisted from appimage so we have to use the libstdc++ of the system the program is built on - we require c++17 compiler which require gcc-9 minimum


[09-Jul-21 09:40 AM] Slyris#2880
@ComputerGenie 

```sh
sudo apt install build-essential
sudo apt install software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gcc-9 g++-9
```


[09-Jul-21 09:41 AM] Slyris#2880
(if you use ubuntu 20.04 by default this is not required or any system with GLIBCXX_3.4.26 pre installed)


[09-Jul-21 09:42 AM] Slyris#2880
(to check which version is supported you can use):

`strings path_to_lib_cxx | grep GLIBCXX`


[09-Jul-21 09:44 AM] Slyris#2880
(To summarize, until now we were using clang++ and libc++ (from clang) in C++ 17/20 and had no problem exporting libc++ in the final binary, but due to the Qt bug we had to urgently use the libc++ from the system knowing that Qt cannot run with libc++ & libstdc++ since the introduction of their bugs.)


[09-Jul-21 09:45 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
great for users of a specific branded fork, sucks to be the rest of us not using that 1 flavor


[09-Jul-21 09:45 AM] Slyris#2880
I'm absolutely sorry for this, but there is nothing i can do right now - the only solution is to build manually Qt with clang++ and we didn't get the time yet to setup such a CI, i'm also furious about that bug (from Qt)

Yeah unfortunately we cannot build the project with gcc 8.3.0, it's not c++ 17 feature complete :/


[09-Jul-21 09:46 AM] Slyris#2880
we compile it with 9.0 for the moment, if there is a possibility to fallback to 8.3.0 i will do it immediatly, but the requirement of code change was too big


[09-Jul-21 09:47 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
OK, let me come at this from another direction......
an "appimage" should include all the bits and not need a user to install more bits with each new "appimage"


[09-Jul-21 09:48 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
because, "appimage"


[09-Jul-21 09:48 AM] Slyris#2880
yeah but libstdc++ is blacklisted by appimage

Out of interest I was looking at South Korean stable coins.  Binance used to have one, but have discontinued it.  Terra  seem to have the only South Korean stable coin - terraKRW.  Would it be possible to add Terra stable coins in the future to Atomic DEX?  This would give a KRW/KMD pair on Atomic DEX.

[20-Jul-21 05:43 PM] jspook16#3059
Oh Dex disabled?


[20-Jul-21 06:05 PM] galto#0864
it should work, but transactions won't confirm on the dex side. it was working until yesterday though


[20-Jul-21 06:05 PM] galto#0864
maybe someone who runs the dex network has an idea of why it's halted?

Maybe trading has been halted due to the nature of the asset


[20-Jul-21 09:51 PM] Slyris#2880
Sorry but you officially traded an unsupported asset @find_your_way it's clearly discouraged


[20-Jul-21 09:51 PM] smkhound#7640
on demand chains can be problematic waiting for confirmations if there are no other transactions happening to move the blocks along


[20-Jul-21 09:52 PM] smkhound#7640
one thing you can try is to send yourself some dex every couple of minutes so it can get a confirmation


[20-Jul-21 09:52 PM] smkhound#7640
miners dont mine if theres no transactions in the mempool


[20-Jul-21 09:53 PM] galto#0864
it's not supported on latest adex version yes, but that's not the issue here. you currently can't even make regular dex transactions because there are no blocks to include them


[20-Jul-21 09:53 PM] find_your_way#5266
This asset was created by jl777 and there is a future for dex asset or not...so why it is unsupported? Dont understand


[20-Jul-21 09:54 PM] Slyris#2880
There is a future for DEX asset as explained you will be able to swap it at fixed rate against a new coin in the future


[20-Jul-21 09:54 PM] Slyris#2880
But if it's disabled right now it's for a reason.


[20-Jul-21 09:54 PM] Slyris#2880
Trading them right now is also not a good move in terms of investment if you want my personal opinion


[20-Jul-21 09:56 PM] Slyris#2880
You was clearly making someone really happy by selling your DEX right now i think


[20-Jul-21 09:58 PM] find_your_way#5266
In what way? Swap failed  so nobody is happy...i waiting for refund...price of 43,2 kmd per dex was okey for me

You really need to enter the exact minvolume the LP asks for


[21-Jul-21 01:36 AM] CHMEX#0686
Which i believe on the gui also rounds it to 8


[21-Jul-21 01:41 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
Max/min volumes are rational numbers internally - these can even be something like 1/3 that can't be represented as a finite decimal number. The conversion to a specific number of coin decimals is done only on transaction broadcast attempts. 

GUIs should use rounding only for display purposes. I strongly recommend operating with rational/fraction representation when making requests to API.

Close the app wait 1 min and open it again

@Slyris  there is a DEX offer up @44 KMD, seems the chain is moving again too. My node just got a block mining on 2 CPU cores so the difficulty have adjusted...


[21-Jul-21 02:35 PM] find_your_way#5266
But i still waiting for my refund :-( more than 27 hours now


[21-Jul-21 06:06 PM] smkhound#7640
go to the order history, click on the failed swap to see details, there should be a "recover funds" button that can kickstart the process.

Just read how atomic swaps work from https://komodoplatform.com/en/academy/atomic-swaps/. Question though: if Taker loses their Internet connection after posting payment, might Maker end up with their own funds and Taker's when Taker doesn't claim their money within the timeout?

Atomic Swaps Explained: The Ultimate Beginner's Guide
An atomic swap is a trade of cryptocurrency made directly from one user to another, without any intermediary to facilitate the transaction.
https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/prtz2WgOqSLzm3EUQ4-8jhcb8Eb4rEyYlIJ3q_xZMVg/https/komodoplatform.com/en/academy/content/images/2021/03/default_komodo_960x480-50.jpg


[24-Jul-21 03:55 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
If the taker doesn‚Äôt spend the makers payment by the end of the timelock the maker can spend it.  Set to 4hrs 20mins.


[24-Jul-21 10:49 PM] jspook16#3059
#Refund


[24-Jul-21 10:54 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
The secret is revealed at that point, and the taker for all intents and purposes refuses to spend it.


[24-Jul-21 10:55 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
It is a step that takes less than a half a second for the taker to do


[24-Jul-21 11:00 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
It would require the taker going offline right as maker spends the payment and not being able to come on for the entirety of the timelock.  Very rare edge case.   We are aware of this and other known cases in atomic swap logic and are working to fix them.    There are 2 methods of counteracting what he is describing which is called the sleeping vulnerability. One is a mitigation and that is having the maker timelock be longer.  The other is to have taker spend be asynchronous.     The latter being the more optimal but much harder to design mechanism

[24-Jul-21 11:11 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Also would require maker to be aware he can reclaim the refund ( might just have forgot because they thought swap complete because they received taker coins ).  This is more of a case of taking advantage of someone rather than a failure of the protocol.   And somehow disconnected at a very small window and losing internet for extended period of time.  I believe BTC timelock is longer as well than the 4hr20mins

No but what could happen is:

- He was online
- You matched him
- He went offline


[29-Jul-21 09:41 PM] CryptoStan#9341
@Slyris - I reproduced the same issue with several different makers / takers, and with more than 3 different pairs. Same thing.


[29-Jul-21 09:42 PM] CryptoStan#9341
UTXO "first step" happens perfectly fine. Then the BEP20 "maker payment" fails / times out.


[29-Jul-21 09:43 PM] CryptoStan#9341
I also reproduced same issue on both Windows and Ubuntu, as well as several hours apart. Worked with cipi earlier today - He compacted one of the nodes to see if that would solve the problem, but it did not. I am using the most recent artifact from GitHub, which worked just fine about 24 hours ago - so I don't think it's the DEX itself.

Actually... that XVC/LTC failed on last step (maker fail) but somehow transmitted to API


[29-Jul-21 10:16 PM] CryptoStan#9341
It was that last swap ID that I shared above


[29-Jul-21 10:16 PM] Slyris#2880

`2ff2ddf8-a52c-4807-8fce-9cb5b323e3ba` make went offline and not sent status to seed node yet (so it's even not yet officially failed on his side)
`1d80241c-5737-475f-b142-ae50439202d6` same as above
`4cfe2044-b0ee-4401-8279-85c1c7c2c184` finished succesfully on maker side, but taker probably disconnected before swap finish and not completed it (there is no taker swap status)


[30-Jul-21 05:57 AM] CryptoStan#9341
@TonyL - That same maker's pairs keep showing up... for the first two. They fail every time, but only after taking "taker's fee"


[30-Jul-21 05:59 AM] CryptoStan#9341
For the last one, I waited for 2 hours then had to move locations. The DEX should have either gone to completion or timed me out by 120 minutes


[30-Jul-21 05:59 AM] CryptoStan#9341
Not sure why it allowed it to go on forever like that.


[30-Jul-21 06:05 AM] CryptoStan#9341
I then tried to repeat the same BEP20 token swap and it failed on maker's side after taking "taker's fee"... different machine, different time, different OS (Windows 1st time, Ubuntu 2nd time)

Dogedex is just a skin. It is still atomicdex with the same orders/way to use the app/etc. legit just different colors and the doge symbol. Think you need a GitHub account to use v5.0

Think of it like this:
Marketmaker MM2.0 is the engine and chassis, the bodywork (atomicdex, dogedex, marmara dex, piratedex, ...) is just different, but underneath it shares the exact same architecture


[02-Aug-21 12:55 PM] Cryptoon#3362

Hi, i'm struggling to make a THC/KMD swap on AtonicDEX Mac.  When i select some orders from the order book (the blue side) it sometimes says 'THC volume is lower than minimum trade' and I think this is a rounding issue because the volume shows 8 decimals while the error shows 15 decimals.


[06-Aug-21 12:58 AM] edy80y#5474
even if i round it up to clear the warning, or select an order without a warning, i get 0/3 matches, then '0/3' changes to an icon and the order sits there doing nothing.  after a while the order disappears, not in history either.

What does "Parent chain is not enabled" mean ? on every bep20 coin


[07-Aug-21 02:25 PM] boho#6031
You need to enable BNB (parent chain for BEP20 tokens, same as ETH for ERC20 tokens).


[07-Aug-21 02:28 PM] boho#6031
Also you need to have some BNB deposited since you will need to pay fees for transactions .

Hi guys, I'm new to the AtomicDex and like it a lot. I have a question though. I have added Polymath-ERC20 to the wallet, which worked very nicely and moved my Poly over there but they have no value in the wallet. Am I doing something wrong here?

[11-Aug-21 07:36 PM] SaltyCroc#4456
Trying to send ETH and a few ERC-20s from atomicDEX 0.5.0 to Trust Wallet, and several have stuck on "Prepare to send <coin name>" for over an hour.  (Strangely EVERY coin in the wallet opened for sending shows the "Prepare to send <coin name>" with the spinner). Shutting down and killing the atomicDex processes seems to clear the lockup. Retrying again and another ERC-20s goes thru in a few minutes, the rest don't. I understand this is beta software. FYI only.

also not sure if you are going to keep the tBCH support in the wallet. I think it will be helpful but the "view on explorer" is not working the link redirect to blockchair.com but it doesn't support bch test net. Maybe you can use one of those instead:

in one swap. I see I've paid the fee twice. could be for two different things. I see you have a note for users to add, maybe if a transaction is swap related it could be useful to see what was the coin spent for  https://imgur.com/a/JnCDg8D

The minimum trading amount is set by the maker not the taker


[12-Aug-21 08:44 PM] Slyris#2880
So the maker was expecting this minimum trading amount it's seems


[12-Aug-21 08:45 PM] uak#6718
I see, maybe I set the offer without paying attention

[12-Aug-21 08:47 PM] uak#6718
here I was confused that which trade did I do, is it possible to add something on top of logo that says. "you sent" and "you received" . or maybe add arrow to show the trade direction


[12-Aug-21 08:47 PM] uak#6718
as I was having two wallets open


[12-Aug-21 08:47 PM] Slyris#2880
I believe it's will be easier when we will add main-net you will be able to use the simple view then

[12-Aug-21 08:48 PM] uak#6718
for slp tokens?


[12-Aug-21 08:48 PM] Slyris#2880
yeah right now we just pushed the testing tokens as you may see (usdf/tBCH)


[12-Aug-21 08:49 PM] Slyris#2880
There is a burn mechanism for slp tokens - that's why we take our time on the testnet testing


[12-Aug-21 08:49 PM] Slyris#2880
to be sure everything went smooth


[12-Aug-21 08:49 PM] uak#6718

[12-Aug-21 08:52 PM] Slyris#2880
and ETHR


[12-Aug-21 08:52 PM] Slyris#2880
so we can detect such bugs (such your fees problem)


[12-Aug-21 08:52 PM] uak#6718
is there anyone that we can contact while you are absent regarding the desktop wallet issues?

https://blockexplorer.one/bitcoin-cash/testnet this one sounds not bad


[12-Aug-21 08:55 PM] uak#6718
regarding the burn issue, creating slp tokens is so cheap so people may want to test adding their test coin on the main net. would it be possible to have that? like adding a custom token.


[12-Aug-21 08:55 PM] uak#6718
instead of having it to go through PR


[12-Aug-21 08:55 PM] Slyris#2880
It's will be possible if you provide API


[12-Aug-21 08:55 PM] Slyris#2880
i use an API for adding custom tokens on ETH/BSC for example


[12-Aug-21 08:55 PM] Slyris#2880
everything come from etherscan/bscscan


[12-Aug-21 08:56 PM] Slyris#2880

[13-Aug-21 12:57 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
It works the same way as a transparent atomic swap. Funds are sent from the z-address to transparent P2SH and then returned to the shielded pool when the trade completes.
Reference transactions:
<https://pirate.explorer.dexstats.info/tx/b019aa69f929b748f9a6a18f5d6cb9a4d16dd8ed55a0205ec6bc8bf1e9fc325a>

The difference is the dex fee. MM2 enables shielded dex fee output decryption by the Outgoing viewing key (OVK) that every node knows. So the maker can check that taker sent the dex fee to the correct address and amounts are valid. No spends and other outputs information is revealed.
<https://pirate.explorer.dexstats.info/tx/e7a557f724359035d73a86bf1a88867b6247de3e0e3460af93f0f2f27d1e2e64> - one of the outputs of this tx is dex fee. It can be decrypted with all seven 32 bytes OVK.


[13-Aug-21 01:09 AM] jorian#4555
right, i see


[13-Aug-21 01:10 AM] jorian#4555
so, transparent p2sh addresses are enabled on ARRR for just atomicdex? or can i now make a p2sh transaction as well?

how many coins they got enabled?


[13-Aug-21 01:19 AM] smkhound#7640
mot likely a connection issue, activating less coins might help depending on if it is standard or intermittent


[13-Aug-21 01:34 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
Anyone can construct and send a transparent P2SH transaction on the ARRR chain now. It's not possible to allow it only to AtomicDEX. Or at least I don't know how to do so for now üôÇ


[13-Aug-21 01:40 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
Clarification: only specific HTLC P2SH script is allowed. Also, one more script type is reserved for the future dex fee protocol change.


[13-Aug-21 01:46 AM] jorian#4555
i figured, because p2sh allows any script


[13-Aug-21 01:46 AM] jorian#4555
thanks!


[13-Aug-21 01:46 AM] jorian#4555
merged in atomicdex soon? üôÇ


[13-Aug-21 01:52 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
There is a lot of work to do <https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/927>. The current version uses the same keypair in HTLC scripts - all the swaps of the specific seed can be linked to each other. We need to complete the checklist and add the light client support to consider the integration as production-ready. It will take plenty of time üôÇ

[14-Aug-21 01:11 AM] FlavorD‚Ñ¢#8259
Okay, third time I'm asking this question, let's see if I can get an answer this time. Is it possible to update an asset that was added to AtomicDex and how? Like adding the coigecko-id when forgotten the first time.


[14-Aug-21 02:17 AM] smkhound#7640
There is a `username.coins.0.4.3.json file (or something like that) which you can edit manually.
Otherwise you can reset assets config and add it again.


[14-Aug-21 02:20 AM] FlavorD‚Ñ¢#8259
Thanks, I figured it out. Just deleting the asset and doing it again worked. I was just worried I could lose my coins doing that but then remembered the coins aren't actually in the wallet but on the blockchain.

Few possibility here:

- deadlock in mm2
- electrum unreacheable under 30 seconds
- your internet dropped
- you tried to start a second instance of mm2, or you're previous instance got killed


[14-Aug-21 05:40 AM] mffiavaa#0937
can i add komodo as a custom rpc to metamask? and how?


[14-Aug-21 05:40 AM] Slyris#2880
The best way to find the reason is to use https://www.postman.com/ - trying to paste the request:

```json
[
    {
        "method": "my_orders",
        "userpass": ""
    },
    {
        "from_timestamp": 1546290000,
        "limit": 50,
        "method": "my_recent_swaps",
        "page_number": 1,
        "to_timestamp": 1631480400,
        "userpass": ""
    },
    {
        "method": "active_swaps",
        "statuses": true,
        "userpass": ""
    }
]
```

You're userpass can be found in your settings -> view private keys & seed

- if you don't get any answer this -> its likely a deadlock
- if you receive an answer but with error after sometime -> it's maybe a timeout
- if you get a perfect answer -> it's a gui problem

You canno't do that on metamask yet unfortunately !


[14-Aug-21 05:41 AM] Slyris#2880
(You should use AtomicDEX Mobile or Desktop to be able to see all your smart chain assets)

i use atomicdex but would be good if we were able to see our assets on other wallets too

You can either:

- Open finder, and go to: `/Users/your_user_name/Library/Application Support/AtomicDex Desktop/config`
- Open a terminal and type: `cd $HOME/Library/Application Support/AtomicDex Desktop/config`
- Remove all the `.json` file that you see (please do not delete the *.seed files)
- Restart the application

Please also update to the following binaries: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/actions/runs/1135434408

You need to be loggged to be able to download the artifact !

When there is a space in osx terminal we use `\` in path

This is because in bash the escape character is `\` -> https://www.shellscript.sh/escape.html

I am trying to exchange BTC to ETH, but dex is reporting "ETH parent chain balance is 0". My part of sending BTC will not spend ETH gas, that should be covered by the ETH swapper side. Am I missing something?


[23-Aug-21 02:41 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
You need some ETH to buy ETH (or ERC20 tokens) & some BNB to buy more BNB (or BEP20 tokens).


[23-Aug-21 02:44 AM] jansako#3330
Even if you are swapping BTC for ETH, the last part of the swap is you telling the ETH chain to send you the ETH you bought. This is done by a transaction & to send it you need to have ETH.


[23-Aug-21 02:58 AM] uak#6718
@smkhound hey, any new build with slp improvement? I'm about to post a video calling for testing


[23-Aug-21 03:52 AM] 11aa1#6039
Thank you for the explanation, I saw in another atomic wallet project, that it was possible to swap ETH without having ETH, so I assumed to experience the same behaviour.


[23-Aug-21 04:05 AM] jansako#3330
Either they are swapping a form of 'wrapped ETH', so not a 'real' atomic swap, or the user pays the ETH TX fee another way, perhaps bundled into the swap fee itself.

@artem.pikulin @Slyris 
Do you know why atomicdex and mm2 does not select the best order sometimes?
I set up 50 orders on KMD OOT 10000 each with 0,00008 KMD increase in between

if I ask for 10000 at 0.00121 it will select that one even there are cheaper ones

according to https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/pull/1195/commits/c001eba05c3bc654e97224b86574f15d70a46a00 it's should contains the fixed version of mm2

[23-Aug-21 12:39 PM] cromwell#1540
I have a question about the AtomicDex desktop UI on Linux- I just received some KMD from an exchange.  It shows an alert for three notifications in the upper left of the UI.  The three quantities are the identical.
-You sent KMD # / Your wallet balance changed / 23 August 2021 hh:27
-You received KMD # / Your wallet balance changed / 23 August 2021 hh:26
-You received KMD # / Your wallet balance changed / 23 August 2021 hh:25
Why are there three messages?  The current balance and transfer amount are okay.


[23-Aug-21 12:42 PM] Slyris#2880
Because of UTXO's @cromwell


[23-Aug-21 12:43 PM] cromwell#1540
Hmmm...  OK.  I know what UTXOs are, but how is that relevant here?  I had some existing KMD and added some more in the transfer.  Did something happen after the receive?


[23-Aug-21 12:44 PM] Slyris#2880
It's because the program check balance change and not transaction history for the notification and UTXO balance change a lot due to the mechanism


[23-Aug-21 12:45 PM] Slyris#2880
Checking tx history of all enabled coin would be not cost efficient but later with web socket this problem will disappear


[23-Aug-21 12:46 PM] cromwell#1540
OK.  So, was a new transaction automatically created to pull all of my KMD into a single UTXO or are the 2 receives still in separate UTXOs on the blockchain?

@Slyris we used now the latest mm2.1 branch still doesnt match cheapest

Do we need to use dev? Maybe


[24-Aug-21 02:23 AM] jorian#4555
is it the `mm2.1` branch we need btw?


[24-Aug-21 02:23 AM] Slyris#2880
No it's should be on mm2.1 branch

i might have used the wrong method though


[24-Aug-21 02:24 AM] jorian#4555
upon closer inspection of the issue above


[24-Aug-21 02:24 AM] Slyris#2880
Btw i believe oot is excluded from best orders since a moment but need to double check


[24-Aug-21 02:24 AM] Slyris#2880
It's need to have 5000$ volume to appear in best orders


[24-Aug-21 02:24 AM] Slyris#2880
If I'm not mistaken


[24-Aug-21 02:26 AM] jorian#4555
curious to know why there is a minimum amount


[24-Aug-21 02:26 AM] Slyris#2880
Because people are abusing of best orders mechanism


[24-Aug-21 02:26 AM] jorian#4555
and even more curious to know why it is defined per coin on the protocol level


[24-Aug-21 02:26 AM] Slyris#2880
It's not defined per coin or per protocol


[24-Aug-21 02:26 AM] Slyris#2880
But on coingecko 24h volume


[24-Aug-21 02:27 AM] Slyris#2880
And it's supposed to be removed for smart chain later.


[24-Aug-21 02:27 AM] jorian#4555
oh, because you query coingecko?


[24-Aug-21 02:27 AM] CHMEX#0686
But mm2 doesnt query coingevko does it?


[24-Aug-21 02:27 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah and this will also change next split we have a new aggregator.


[24-Aug-21 02:27 AM] Slyris#2880
Doesn't, but in desktop there is extra filtering


[24-Aug-21 02:28 AM] jorian#4555
but that is not the issue for us right?


[24-Aug-21 02:28 AM] jorian#4555
we want mm2 to pick the best order


[24-Aug-21 02:28 AM] jorian#4555
regardless of what coingecko thinks


[24-Aug-21 02:28 AM] jorian#4555
best order == cheapest price


[24-Aug-21 02:29 AM] jorian#4555
best order is kind of ambiguous


[24-Aug-21 02:29 AM] Slyris#2880
Yes then mm2 itself should work


[24-Aug-21 02:29 AM] jorian#4555
because 'best' could also mean an order that doesn't require a notarization


[24-Aug-21 02:29 AM] Slyris#2880
Maybe the bug is still here due to seed nodes not updated yet.


[24-Aug-21 02:29 AM] Slyris#2880
Seednode provide best orders answer and they are not using last version yet


[24-Aug-21 02:29 AM] jorian#4555
can other people run a seednode?


[24-Aug-21 02:29 AM] Slyris#2880
Have you tried with your own seednode locally ?


[24-Aug-21 02:29 AM] Slyris#2880
Ofc


[24-Aug-21 02:29 AM] Slyris#2880
In mm2.json


[24-Aug-21 02:30 AM] Slyris#2880
You can specify your seednode.


[24-Aug-21 02:30 AM] jorian#4555
what does the seednode need to run?


[24-Aug-21 02:30 AM] Slyris#2880
Just a boolean in the mm2 JSON file


[24-Aug-21 02:30 AM] CHMEX#0686
Wow really so in theory one seednode can manipulate which order gets matched?


[24-Aug-21 02:31 AM] TonyL#3577
According to the thread above it has nothing to deal with best orders


[24-Aug-21 02:31 AM] Slyris#2880
No but you can run locally if the bug is still present by running your own seednode on your own network id.

it's not intended in protocol design right now that on buy call best price order will be selected, however closest price order should be matched now, not random one as it happens right now


[24-Aug-21 04:17 AM] jorian#4555
`best price order` meaning lowest price for specified volume?


[24-Aug-21 04:18 AM] jorian#4555
curious to know how the procedure for picking the order would be

[24-Aug-21 04:21 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
Curious if such a procedure would also take estimated fees into account (eating up the orderbook with small TXs may be more expensive than selecting a trade that can fill the order in a single TX)


[24-Aug-21 04:22 AM] jorian#4555
i think that such eat-the-orderbook call doesn't exist yet


[24-Aug-21 04:22 AM] jorian#4555
and yes, it would have to account for tx fees

that is because you tried to send to a bech32 address, but the version of ADEX does only support legacy addresses, no bech32


[25-Aug-21 04:50 AM] cipi#4502
0.5.0 has support for bech32... i just sent such a tx: https://chainz.cryptoid.info/sys/tx.dws?58d871a847afb6876f3c88559c158a531b3b01a5fc1a3318314e63a72a88e8ed
the inputs are coming from a legacy address and they were sent to a bech32 address


[25-Aug-21 05:46 AM] jorian#4555
i'm actually a bit concerned about this statement. When did we ever go to a 3rd party node determining what the best price of a trade offer should be? To me, this should all be done local with the knowledge of the orderbook that exists on the local node


[25-Aug-21 05:47 AM] jorian#4555
curious to hear why it was done this way


[25-Aug-21 05:48 AM] jorian#4555
And if best order determination really depends on a 3rd party seed node, then the statement `Decentralized P2P Orderbooks` can't be true, as the seednode has to maintain its own book of orders to pick the 'best order'


[25-Aug-21 05:52 AM] cipi#4502
Slyris was talking about a special API call: https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.html#best-orders
it does not affect the normal ordermatching, only this call needs the help of the seed nodes


[25-Aug-21 05:54 AM] jorian#4555
right, thanks for clearing up


[25-Aug-21 05:55 AM] jorian#4555
what would be the reason `best_orders` needs a third party orderbook? no passphrase necessary to get best orders?


[25-Aug-21 05:57 AM] cipi#4502
good question, i don't know üôÇ


[25-Aug-21 07:34 AM] two4ten#4676
whats the cost of the api


[25-Aug-21 07:34 AM] two4ten#4676
thank you for the help above.


[25-Aug-21 07:49 AM] two4ten#4676
also is this legacy/bech32 wallet migrate what is holding up progress for the blockchain community? i guess i am am asking is this common.  i was looking to transfer sys from adex to bittrex. but bittrex doesn't accept the same wallet address.  this is not the first time i have ran into this or something like this. I consider it a cost of bussiness/learning in cryptoland at this point. I simply do not comprehend reason or motive to not updating this as one of the few exchanges to offer the coin.   I am not from the programming background obviously.


[25-Aug-21 07:52 AM] cipi#4502
you just need to find the corresponding legacy address to this bech32 address and send the SYS to that legacy address, it will show up on the bech32 address (on Bittrex or whatever)
or you update ADEX GUI to 0.5.0 and send directly to the bech32 address... the 2 addresses are the same, just different address format
you can download pre 0.5.0 ADEX from my github: https://github.com/cipig/atomicDEX-Desktop/actions/runs/1155829734 ... or wait for the official release to come out


[25-Aug-21 08:18 AM] two4ten#4676
thank you for the direction. I really appreciate it.   I will check out the old dex. If im in over my head i am happy to hold until your product is finished.  Its gonna be big. congratulations.  If you have a donation address i believe in thanking those that help others. if you believe a project could use the donation more then you please don't hesitate.  I have found some projects are pennies away from great results.

The bug regarding windows update restart was solved this version (basically no self update for windows anymore, but since you have 0.4.3, you cannot enjoy the fix, you need a manual download) (because 0.4.3 doesn't contains the fix)

[28-Aug-21 08:32 AM] Slyris#2880
You can do it manually but normally, it's should enable with atleast KMD/LTC, only those 2 coins are required

I read you are on windows, you can go %APPDATA%/atomic_qt/config/ and delete the .json of your wallet


[28-Aug-21 08:32 AM] TonyL#3577
It's ours (KomodoPlatform) released builds

what comes on to "stores" and the like happens at the time-frame of the stores


[28-Aug-21 08:35 AM] CHMEX#0686
funny it recreates it with the same config. Is there another path where the config is stored?


[28-Aug-21 08:37 AM] Slyris#2880
Nop, not another path but you should remove all the *.json file that have the same wallet name then


[28-Aug-21 08:37 AM] CHMEX#0686

@Slyris Running 0.5 on windows, orders are happening from KMD to VRSC and can see maker reduce by the amount for the order. But I cannot see any pending orders in my DEX wallet.


[28-Aug-21 08:13 PM] RandiMcRandom#3232
^ maker reduce amount of the order? For example you were supposed to get 60 KMD and it switched to 50 KMD?


[28-Aug-21 08:14 PM] RandiMcRandom#3232
That‚Äôs what happened to me. It switched the amount I agreed to when I hit start swap. Would have lost out on over $10 on a $80 swap if I didn‚Äôt close the app after a couple mins and noticing what happened


[28-Aug-21 09:21 PM] Reta#9348

seems ARRR was not included in adex0.5.0 ... any comments on why?
I'd guess TOKEL IDO and wARRR arrr quite some innovations and maybe it could have increased risk of s.t. going wrong pushing yet a third change into the release?

AtomicDex 0.5.0 (on Linux) shows a message of "DEX features are not allowed in the US".  Are US Komodo participants excluded from the phase 1 & 2 TKL sales?


[29-Aug-21 08:30 AM] RandiMcRandom#3232
I‚Äôve been using v0.5.0 dogedex and it has the geoblocker removed

yes its just a skin. it has KMD and everything else the adex version should have

OK.  I'll check it out.  Thx.


[29-Aug-21 09:00 AM] CHMEX#0686
I didnt on this machine. It worked on a other by importing the seed into a new wallet


[29-Aug-21 09:00 AM] CHMEX#0686
Something seems odd but I guess it's dificult to replicate

the only thing you should need is a github account

@Slyris @ca333 after update to 0.5.0 adex stuck at "Enabling assets"...

How can i solve this?


[29-Aug-21 09:20 AM] CHMEX#0686
I believe its a bug on winblows


[29-Aug-21 09:30 AM] find_your_way#5266

[29-Aug-21 09:51 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
internet latency can have an impact on that as well
there's a few VPN locations that I use that make it take "forever" to load ACs because of the lag to electums


[29-Aug-21 09:54 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Got in if you turn on your VPN and begin the connection


[29-Aug-21 09:54 AM] BlackJesus#6161
then whilst in the loop of waiting for assets to load you turn off your VPN and it drops you in the wallet.


[29-Aug-21 09:57 AM] CHMEX#0686
does this version have the geo thing on?

[29-Aug-21 01:47 PM] TonyL#3577
1) Settings -> General -> Enable desktop notifications

2) It might be the case that you reached limit of simultaneously activated coins (it can be also adjusted in Settings -> General)

@TonyL I have disabled Desktop Notifications but I still got those purple popups at the bottom of the application.
The adding of coins seem to be working now. When I tried I had 8 activated coins and when clicking Enable nothing happened but it is working now.


[29-Aug-21 01:53 PM] TonyL#3577
Purple popups a bit different thing (error messages), at the moment we don't have a setting to disable those. What errors do you get?
Glad you able to activate more coins now

Thanks Cipi but I don't think I'm going to be able to figure out how to do that without an installer


[29-Aug-21 02:03 PM] cipi#4502
what installer? there is a package named `atomicdex-desktop-installer-windows-10-qt-5-15-2-743dae0.exe` isn't that what you want?


[29-Aug-21 02:04 PM] Sdunbar#5064
sounds about right, where exactly in there do I find it?


[29-Aug-21 02:05 PM] cipi#4502
click on the latest build, the first one... then you see the downloads... but you need to be logged in to github


[29-Aug-21 02:07 PM] Sdunbar#5064
ah yes, need to be logged in thanks. I'm not normally a github user so not familiar with that

yoo just fyi the updater doesnt overwrite the "atomicdex-desktop.exe" under "Program Files (x86)\AtomicDEX-Desktop" so you gotta delete that manually or it wont update. Win10


[29-Aug-21 07:00 PM] smkhound#7640
if you cant log in, try deleting the coins.json  files in  %appdata%/atomic_qt/config/ (eg. 0.5.0-coins-username.json; 0.4.3-coins-username.json etc)
If that does not resolve, delete the files in  %appdata%/atomic_qt/0.5.0/configs (cfg.ini, config.json, coins.json)

please send me logs if you can, so I can try and find the root cause.
seems to be only windows with issue


[29-Aug-21 07:30 PM] DuqueMH41#7797
this atomicdex 0.5.0 is closing in few seconds windows 10, any clues ?


[29-Aug-21 07:38 PM] smkhound#7640
pls DM me your logs, I might be able to see why


[29-Aug-21 07:39 PM] smkhound#7640
at the moment the only clue is "it's windows". I'm trying to replicate locally


[29-Aug-21 08:43 PM] smkhound#7640
@DuqueMH41 did you update from the message in app or standalone download? installer or zip / portable?


[29-Aug-21 08:45 PM] smkhound#7640
also, which version updating from?


[29-Aug-21 09:15 PM] smkhound#7640
I think we found the issue
windows is not allowing the exe file to be renamed so the new one can take its place
if you uninstall the old version manually (might need to also delete remnants from c:/program files (x86)/atomicdex-desktop), then install 0.5.0, it should work
alternatively you can try the zip file (portable), which should just work either way
Please make sure seed is backed up!

only issue ive seen so far is that i cannot enable ETH. Possibly still an issue with eth? I tried swapping eth on adex a few months ago and i lost ETH fees 3 times! very expensive so i had to send it to a cex


[30-Aug-21 04:32 AM] RandiMcRandom#3232
was also wondering once adex gets bigger is there anyway to help when people lose a lot of money on fees from bugs with the software? didnt know if there was any fund for those things?


[30-Aug-21 04:33 AM] RandiMcRandom#3232
for example kucoin/uni wouldnt make you pay for fees for a trade that never happened type of deal

Of course, I restart and it is working. It gave the same error when electrum servers go down I believe? It says ‚ÄúFailed to enable Ethereum‚Äù blah blah, but now it‚Äôs gone


[30-Aug-21 04:54 AM] RandiMcRandom#3232

in this case and only in the case you still have the error -> settings, view seed & private key and take the rpc password of the session, https://developers.atomicdex.io/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.html#my-balance 

Then you can try to run it in command line, if you do not get answer this means there is a deadlock, if there is an answer this means the error come from the GUI and in this case i will need your logs if you agree

The order screen interface should re-appear when clicking an order, it's flawed now.


[31-Aug-21 03:42 AM] laras#4981
Acts like it does not know you want to open the order screen, it should just re-open and make the interface show again if it is deselected.

Why do i have more then 200 Tokel transaction from 13 may 2020 to 26 august 2021 in my AtomicDex wallet ?


[31-Aug-21 07:12 AM] smkhound#7640
seems to be a misconfiguration, I'm looking into it now


[31-Aug-21 07:21 AM] smkhound#7640
looks like the history for a different coin, should update if switching to another coin and back. Will see if I can find why


[31-Aug-21 08:30 AM] jansako#3330
happened with me yesterday during the IDO as well. Suddenly a bunch of old transactions was showing up.

Hi Devs, in which point release do you plan to have ARRR swaps included & when can we start playing with them? I mean the daily builds... üôÇ


[31-Aug-21 09:53 AM] TonyL#3577
Hi, it'll be added after full implementation on API side - closer to new year I think


[31-Aug-21 10:20 AM] jansako#3330
dang... was hoping for sooner... maybe to push the top of this bull a bit higher, so just before Xmas. I know you are all about tech first & that stuff but sometimes a bit of hype is good too! It does pay the bills. Will be tax bills this year...

Hi, I'm hoping you can help me.  I have some KMD. I've dowloaded AtomicDex on my laptop.  I don't know what wallet my KMD is on as 
 I bought my Komodo about 3 years ago only to watch it tank so I took a couple of years off!  I check the balance on Dexstats asset viewer.  How can I remove my KMD tokens to AtomicDex so I can 
 swap them?  Please could you advise.  Thankyou.


[31-Aug-21 09:06 PM] smkhound#7640
to access your KMD, you need to know the private key (or seed phrase). If they were previously kept in a native wallet (e.g. you downloaded the blockchain to sync), they will be in the wallet.dat file linked to the wallet you previously used.


[31-Aug-21 09:07 PM] smkhound#7640
which wallet did you previously use?


[31-Aug-21 10:00 PM] Dantemonion#1010

Check the "Yes, this is a game" checkbox to load the Game Bar. ...
Click on the Start Recording button (or Win + Alt + R) to begin capturing video.

have you tried to reset your configuration in the settings before enabling TKL, should work fine even without that.

Hello,
I don't understand why the same seed used in AtomicDex creates different addresses than the seed used here:

Doesn't AtomicDex use the BIP39 standard?

So what standard does it use and how can I access private keys outside the application?


[02-Sep-21 08:55 AM] gcharang#6833
it is not a standard algorithm and is used only in the komodo ecosystem. verus wallet, atomicdex, convertpassphrase method in ocean-qt wallet all use it. 

> how can I access private keys outside the application?
you can get privkeys for all supported coins from the settings menu inside atomicdex. any other wallet will accept the privkeys and will give you access.
just the seed to privkey derivation is different


[02-Sep-21 09:03 AM] codzienna dawka propagandy#1653
There is indeed access to privkey.

If I place an order in the order book and it appears on the waiting list, can I go offline (turn off the computer)?
Or maybe the exchange requires being online nonstop?

You have tp be online

pending orders no longer broadcast, and orders in progress can not progress (and will fail if offline for too long)

@TonyL Do I undestand this correctly. The KMD ( taker coin ) will not be spend before it's notarized by the maker node?


[04-Sep-21 01:24 AM] CHMEX#0686
or does taker_payment_confirmations need to be 2 because it looks at confirmation and not rawconfirms?


[04-Sep-21 01:53 AM] TonyL#3577
`Do I undestand this correctly. The KMD ( taker coin ) will not be spend before it's notarized by the maker node?` correct, maker node will wait for notarisation before KMD spending, and also correct that indicator is > 1 confirmations (rawconfirms became confirmations after nota) - you might see prints on maker node in such case that there are 1 from 2 confirmations and it waiting for more (actually it waiting for notarisation)

I have a question about the setprice method (atomicDEX API). According to docs this method is used to place maker sell order (sell base for rel). What method should be used to place taker order?


[04-Sep-21 02:25 PM] cipi#4502
`buy` and `sell` are for taker orders... but atm those will also be turned automatically into a maker order if they are not matched in 20s or so... afaik this will be changed in future or make configurable, so you can choose order type (FillOrKill vs. GoodTillCancelled)

How long does it take for the KMD rewards page to show how much I can claim? It's been 2 minutes and the disk is still loading. I've tried this a few time and the disk just keeps on loading, the rewards page never displays

Should be instant


[05-Sep-21 06:55 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
Just experimenting  with setprice method and I noticed that using this method updates previous maker order(s).  It is a nice feature but is there a way to place two different maker orders (different prices and volumes)?


[05-Sep-21 07:03 AM] cipi#4502
default is to cancel previous orders for same pair, but you can add the parameter `"cancel_previous":false` to `setprice`, then it doesn't

There is a 1/777 % trading fee which is deducated from the total amount

Hello @Pringle - could you try: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/actions/runs/1204827425 after the CI passed, i added a new error function for the claiming rewards, if you do not get it under 2 minute, it's should show an error message with an explanation

Is there a simple way to get the best bid/ask price  for a specific base/rel pair using atomicDex API? 
By simple I mean other than parsing orderbook or best_orders methods response.


[06-Sep-21 02:31 AM] Slyris#2880
There is no such rpc call but you are not forced to parse the whole answer of orderbook, you can just parse the bid/asks array and take the first element of each with JQ

@Slyris correct me if I'm wrong


[09-Sep-21 01:34 AM] jansako#3330
maybe I am dense but the 'how to be a marketmaker' document really just shows the user how to place a simple sell order & how to withdraw coins. There is a mention of 'starting the marketmaker', but no mention that 'marketmaking' this way is entirely a manual process at this point. Meaning the user must ride herd on their orders as the prices change elsewhere.  If the automated version exists/is documented someplace else, there should at least be a link & a note about it.


[09-Sep-21 01:45 AM] gcharang#6833
there is no production ready version of automated price tracking marketmaker rn. @Slyris has a PoC and he is going to rewrite it inro rust afaik


[09-Sep-21 01:49 AM] gcharang#6833
I think the confusion is because the term `marketmaker` in the document just refers to the mm2 binary and not what a "automated price tracking marketmaker" that one woukld expect


[09-Sep-21 03:00 AM] jansako#3330
Indeed. A clarification would be helpful.

there is a perl script that updates prices on mm2 based on your config: https://github.com/cipig/mmtools

Are you transacting any other coins in atomicDEX?

This is certainly incorrect information. 
These amounts are from another coin's transactions, but it is showing as BTC for some reason

the volume seems to be increasing that's good


[10-Sep-21 02:05 PM] QualityASSURANCE#1813
is there a way of tracking the , daily , weekly and yearly volume of the Dex inside Dexstats.info?

There is the tool from @smkhound


[11-Sep-21 03:02 AM] LocoMB#8593
I just have to ask- I have an issue with my atomicdex0.5.0 on ubuntu...
it works bcs I got some TOKEL in the IDO.
I also have some DEX and CRYPTO assets in the wallet, displayed correctly.
But I can NOT make DEX and CRYPTO appear in the dex- tab, they dont appear in the selection tab, even if I go from the wallet tab to the swap tab directly ... what is my problem?


[11-Sep-21 03:05 AM] LocoMB#8593
... ok now starting from terminal and reading the output, I see:
'DEX is wallet only - skipping' , also CRYPTO ...
What does this mean?


[11-Sep-21 03:08 AM] TonyL#3577
Supernet assets are restricted from trading in AtomicDEX GUIs published by Komodo Platform due to legal reasons


[11-Sep-21 03:09 AM] LocoMB#8593
well, this is new obviously, because it did work half a year or so ago
when and where was this communicated?


[11-Sep-21 03:10 AM] TonyL#3577
https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/releases/tag/0.4.1-beta it was introduced in 0.4.1 in April
`:warning: Disable trading for supernet assets`


[11-Sep-21 03:12 AM] LocoMB#8593
well,  not too good, bcs this kind of messaging in the fine print is a bit sinister..
seems not everyone is aware of this, inclduing james:
probably there will be one last dividend from the CRYPTO, it still has significant holdings and there is a buyback on atomicDEX at 30 KMD


[11-Sep-21 03:13 AM] TonyL#3577
atomicDEX protocol not equal atomicDEX GUIs published by Komodo, you can use buyback orders from CLI or from GUI friendly fork without such restrictions


[11-Sep-21 03:14 AM] TonyL#3577
James not using GUIs afaik üôÇ


[11-Sep-21 03:15 AM] LocoMB#8593
again not good, bcs the communication sucks.
I did use cipig NONGEO version 0.4.3 but I was not aware that there is also a NONDEX version - 
which one is that friendly fork? cipig too? ... anyway, I'll find out


[11-Sep-21 03:16 AM] TonyL#3577
probably marmara one, have to check


[11-Sep-21 03:17 AM] LocoMB#8593
a cool! I didnt even know Marmara has a gui fork ...  can you please post it here if you find it?
my problem is I dont have the time to allocate for using cli


[11-Sep-21 03:18 AM] LocoMB#8593
I am aware of the legal boobytraps involved in all this and it is annoying,
and having said that, I find the communication could be more efficient... üåµ


[11-Sep-21 03:19 AM] TonyL#3577
yeah no restrictions in marmara fork

[11-Sep-21 03:20 AM] LocoMB#8593
good question, I can not explain in a few words now, but TL;DR is: it is


[11-Sep-21 03:20 AM] TonyL#3577
protocol is decentralised and GUIs publishing directly by us


[11-Sep-21 03:21 AM] TonyL#3577
it's in a few words, personally I'm not deep into legal details


[11-Sep-21 03:21 AM] LocoMB#8593
@cryptosammy _they_ can nail down wallet providers for even providing code that allows you to access your blockchain assets,
but even _they_ cannot nail down a protocol


[11-Sep-21 03:22 AM] cryptosammy#3587
crazy.


[11-Sep-21 03:22 AM] TonyL#3577
if there were no risks, we would not make such restrictions


[11-Sep-21 03:22 AM] LocoMB#8593

@TonyL .. come to think of it, I did use marmara 0.4.1 before to swap some assets but I had forgotten,
because after that I had used cipig 0.4.3 w/o GEO .. this is confusing .. but I wouldnt know how to  display this better .. 
(maybe adding some little naming convention? dunno) 
anyway, I am getting that marmara now .. üåä


[11-Sep-21 03:34 AM] TonyL#3577
yes, I can understand that it's quite frustrating but not much can be done on this point until legal framework creation around these assets


[11-Sep-21 03:47 AM] LocoMB#8593
@TonyL  ...  I had to delete the .atomic_qt folder to make it work, but is running now..
now here is a question: can this be modified by simply changing an entry in some conffile?


[11-Sep-21 04:17 AM] TonyL#3577
there is wallet_only flag in coins config, I think thats it: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/blob/dev/assets/config/0.5.1-coins.json#L755


[11-Sep-21 04:48 AM] cryptosammy#3587
@TonyL does it require an entry in mm2/coins too?


[11-Sep-21 04:51 AM] TonyL#3577
nope, this config file above contains GUI specific settings for assets


[11-Sep-21 04:51 AM] cryptosammy#3587
cool, just checking


[11-Sep-21 04:51 AM] cryptosammy#3587
this is for supernet assets only because of legal reasons right?


[11-Sep-21 08:12 AM] cipi#4502
USDT-ERC20, XPM, NVC and XVC are set to wallet_only too in config of GUI, because of technical reasons... swapping with them does not work, but wallet functionality does


[11-Sep-21 08:13 AM] cipi#4502
just saying to not change those, or you could loose money if you try to swap them (coins gone, never come back)


[11-Sep-21 07:55 PM] david yi#7685
Why my swap didn't finish for 5hours?


[11-Sep-21 10:32 PM] cryptosammy#3587
I am doing some integrations with adex for fun (Paxful and Skrill). Is there an API doc for the app functions? I am looking to retrieve the default coin address for BTC added to Portfolio.

can you please DM me your swap status screen?


[12-Sep-21 02:18 AM] cryptosammy#3587
@Slyris my bad, I didn't meant that API but the functions in the source like the ones used in the QML


[12-Sep-21 02:19 AM] cryptosammy#3587
ex. enable_coin_modal.open()


[12-Sep-21 03:15 AM] Slyris#2880
There is no API doc for those ones, you have to browse C++ headers files and find QML names for that.

eg: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/blob/2f43b67937b1a65c68cabb8a5ae2f7854a5edf2c/src/app/app.hpp#L65


[12-Sep-21 03:17 AM] cryptosammy#3587
@Slyris I was doing so already. I am new to QML, but getting the hang of it


[12-Sep-21 03:17 AM] Slyris#2880
For example to get the current selected coin address it's:

`API.wallet_pg.ticker_infos.address`

Hot-reload means that you do not have to re-compile to test your front-end changes, you can use the hot-reload software for that.


[12-Sep-21 03:20 AM] cryptosammy#3587
i know what hot reload is

holy shit


[12-Sep-21 03:21 AM] cryptosammy#3587
if I turn that on, does it require other stuff?


[12-Sep-21 03:21 AM] Slyris#2880
Nop, just to recompile


[12-Sep-21 03:21 AM] Slyris#2880
After that, the first time you launch the app i believe you have to setup the hot-reload, but you can ask @syl for that

ERC20 is supported... txes cost a lot on the ERC20 chain though https://etherscan.io/gastracker
better use BEP20 instead


[12-Sep-21 10:03 AM] N-system#0930
I took a look yesterday, for example, there was no litecoin - usdt erc-20 pair


[12-Sep-21 10:12 AM] cipi#4502
USDT-ERC20 is not supported for trading, uses non-standard-contract... the other erc20 stablecoins can be traded
i personally don't post erc20 orders, i use bep20, because i don't want to pay 30$ for a swap, i rather pay 0.1$ with the bep20 versions... i use USDT-BEP20 as one of the base coins for my orders

Hi, question:

Does AtomicDEX support importing of private keys for every coin?


[12-Sep-21 08:54 PM] uak#6718
Hi, I think the wallet uses the same private key for all coins


[12-Sep-21 09:17 PM] smkhound#7640
You can your a private key or seed, and it will create a wallet with all addresses for all enabled coins linked to the seed/private key

Hello, I just installed and setup my wallet for atomic dex. I tried to login but received an error saying "failed to enable assets". It continued trying to load but nothing happened. Are there any settings for VPN, router, or firewall that need adjusting to get it to work?


[13-Sep-21 09:53 AM] Slyris#2880
Hey @LexRex93 which version are you using?

It's the latest version for Windows


[13-Sep-21 06:17 PM] smkhound#7640
Try disabling firewall / AV temporarily to eliminate it as problem.
You'll need to add exceptions to FW for mm2 and atomicdex executables.

Hi,

I accidentally sent KMD to my account with MCL project through AtomicDex Windows application. I can't see this in the MCL windows app, is there an easy way to get the KMDs or is the KMDs steam üò¶


[14-Sep-21 02:33 AM] Slyris#2880
Hello @Ugur if you have your seed or private key, you can just download the official atomicdex application and restore your wallet, then you should be able to access your fund's.

The wallet part is not subject to any geo-restrictions, so you should not be blocked either.


[14-Sep-21 03:41 AM] Ugur#2795
Thanks for the answer. I didn't post to AtomicDex from an account on AtomicDex.

AtomicDex=>I sent it to MCL Windows Application. I created my MCL wallet with the MCL Windows application.

What should I do.


[14-Sep-21 03:42 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah but if you have your private key from the MCL application, you can just use that one when restoring your wallet, you should then retrieve your KMD in atomicdex


[14-Sep-21 03:44 AM] Ugur#2795
I have the private key yes, I'm looking for the easiest way to do this. Can't do without installing Komodo windows chain. If you can add my MCL wallet to AtomicDex that will be the easiest way otherwise it will take time to set up the chain etc.


[14-Sep-21 04:03 AM] Slyris#2880
It's exactly what i'm telling you to do, by using your private key from your native wallet (here MCL), and using the `import` button on the initial page of atomicdex you will be able to restore your wallet and access the funds you have send here.


[14-Sep-21 04:49 AM] gcharang#6833
export private key for the address from the MCL wallet. it is a string that starts with "U"
import it in atomicdex and create a new wallet. You will have to select the option to "use custom seed" and use the private key instead of seed in the input.
you should be able to see your KMD in that wallet


[14-Sep-21 08:04 AM] Ugur#2795
Thanks for the help, I'll try and post the result.


[14-Sep-21 12:46 PM] Ugur#2795

[16-Sep-21 01:12 AM] find_your_way#5266
@Slyris @cipi @gcharang whats happened when someone started a swap, close the app or shutdown the pc? the swap will 100% fail or is there a chance that the swap will be successfull? what happened when some hours later the person go online again with adex? will the swap continue? thx


[16-Sep-21 01:55 AM] cipi#4502
depends on the time he is offline and the status of the swap... if it waits for tx confirmations and still does after you come back online, it will continue... but in 90% of the cases it will fail and be refunded

How does the geo-blocking work exactly? Is it blocking the affected IP from opening the required sockets or is it preventing the daemon from starting? Is it advisable to use the forked version at the Marmara github? Many thanks for your replies!


[16-Sep-21 11:43 AM] cipi#4502
the app does not let you switch to the DEX tab when your IP is from a restricted country
yes, use the Marmara version, the check is simply turned off there

did you type TKL ?

mmmm still no tokel when i go to add it in Add Asset


[16-Sep-21 05:21 PM] cipi#4502
is it already on? üòÑ


[16-Sep-21 05:24 PM] jspook16#3059
im not sure what you mean. I'll restart adex


[16-Sep-21 05:27 PM] cipi#4502
the "Reset assets configuration" should have actually already restarted ADEX... it's needed for the new config to take effect


[16-Sep-21 05:47 PM] jspook16#3059
It did. Ive Reset Assets Configuration multiple times and restarted multiple times. Still no TOKEL option


[16-Sep-21 05:53 PM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
Did you search "TKL" I think I recal it not showing up when I searched TOKEL


[16-Sep-21 05:54 PM] jspook16#3059
I did multiple searches in different ways. Odd that it isnt showing up


[16-Sep-21 05:55 PM] cipi#4502
weird... you can try to delete the file config in `~/.atomic_qt/config/` ... some thing `0.5.x.*json`


[16-Sep-21 06:00 PM] jspook16#3059
I renamed it to something else.... start adex up and still no joy. Also tried a different account on same machine and no tokel there either


[16-Sep-21 06:00 PM] jspook16#3059
Is there a newer dev version on github? Im using the released version


[16-Sep-21 06:02 PM] cipi#4502
sure: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/actions
but it should work with the 0.5.0 release


[16-Sep-21 06:10 PM] jspook16#3059
I know it works on my other machine with 0.5.0 but for some reason it doesnt work on my main machine


[16-Sep-21 06:16 PM] cipi#4502
have you tried to remove the config, so that ADEX recreates it?


[16-Sep-21 06:17 PM] jspook16#3059
I went ahead and got the latest from github. This one is working now.


[16-Sep-21 06:17 PM] jspook16#3059
I will go back and test by removing the config file entirely

When I use the DEX in pro and try switching between pairs, it take a good 5 to 10 seconds to refresh. Is this normal?

When I click on 'History' to see my previous transactions, nothing displays.

Would be nice to have another little tab


[16-Sep-21 09:08 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
like a column that shows all pending trades


[16-Sep-21 09:08 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
for all pairs


[16-Sep-21 09:08 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239

Just like a "click here to exchange $1 kmd for $1 BNB for gas fees"

Is it me or is the AtomicDesktop quite buggy? On starting the program not every asset is visible, a restart makes them visible (those kind of things)


[17-Sep-21 02:44 AM] TonyL#3577
On what platform are you and how many assets do you have enabled @GoeieDagSchotel ?

[17-Sep-21 02:45 AM] TonyL#3577

[17-Sep-21 02:45 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
On the first try i could not even manually add SMFT again, it just was not in the list


[17-Sep-21 02:46 AM] TonyL#3577
(login to github is needed to download)


[17-Sep-21 02:47 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222

Also, my antivirus went mental when trying to install, might be smart to get the .exe whitelisted

[18-Sep-21 09:58 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
Stable (0,1% cpu, about 250 to 300mb ram, network around 4 megabit), it just takes like 30 sec to 1 minute to load orders, somehow its like it glitches somewhere. Other parts of the program work fine (like the wallet, KMD price and graph load fast). It also seems a bit random how long it takes, if i go from Wallet back to DEX tab, the orders in history load fast, then i go to orders tab and back to order history and again it takes 30 seconds to load my filled order(s).


[18-Sep-21 11:05 AM] Slyris#2880
Do you want to try 0.5.1 ?

@here we've just released AtomicDEX Desktop 0.5.1 stable beta patch: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/releases/tag/0.5.1-beta
Reworked coins activation during the startup, so users with huge amount of coins activated shouldn't "stuck" on this step. Enhanced CEX prices aggregator so you will see prices for such assets as MCL, TKL let's say. Fixed few crashes and much more minor fixes.
Happy testing!

No it's not really "inheritance"
Children state is linked to their parent state, examples:

 - Position of children is relative to the parent

Is this why Polymath is not showing any value anymore after I updated the app? My coins are still there but no value for them.


[20-Sep-21 12:03 PM] jspook16#3059
I would think the buy back would still be in place. It's documented that the smtf was purchased. That's a really good question.


[20-Sep-21 12:27 PM] PTYX#6840
yes but if moves from the wallet they have no way of telling if it was sold and bought back

@smkhound not able to find blockchain api in the gaming sdk from the tutorials it looks more like a game engine, how is it related to adex? and why not use a webengineview friendlly approach like webasm?


[21-Sep-21 09:37 PM] smkhound#7640
Flappy bird was a proof of concept. Slyris can tell you more. I assume some functions etc from that sdk were useful for AtomicDEX desktop and thus imported.
There is some gaming dev going on in the community (like CHIPS) and some other WIP side projects. I'm hoping one day to have enough spare time to make a map based wargame, with possible TKL NFT integration.


[21-Sep-21 09:51 PM] cryptosammy#3587

if you (taker) didn't send TakerPayment, then there is nothing to recover


[22-Sep-21 11:02 AM] RandiMcRandom#3232
there are fees to recover. for LTC its not much, maybe 5 cents or 10 cents each time... but those all add up, but more importantly when i was losing my ETH fees you're talking at least $50-$100 ive lost on that


[22-Sep-21 11:02 AM] RandiMcRandom#3232
if not more


[22-Sep-21 11:02 AM] RandiMcRandom#3232
so whos keeping those fees?


[22-Sep-21 11:02 AM] RandiMcRandom#3232
they have to go somewhere


[22-Sep-21 11:02 AM] cipi#4502
takerfee is not recoverable


[22-Sep-21 11:04 AM] cipi#4502
takerfee (1/777 or ~0.15% of TakerPayment) goes to ADEX adress
but the network fee to send this takerfee goes to the miners of the respective chain... with ERC20 it is the ETH miners


[22-Sep-21 11:09 AM] cipi#4502
use BEP20 instead of ERC20, fees are 0.1$ there instead of 20$ or more with ERC20: https://etherscan.io/gastracker


[22-Sep-21 11:12 AM] cipi#4502
btw, sending takerfee back to the taker wouldn't work aynway, since the network fee to send this takerfee is much higher then the takerfee itself, on ERC20


[22-Sep-21 11:23 AM] cipi#4502
https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/715 will help... and avoiding high fee chains during high fee times

i havent swapped eth/wouldnt even dream of using it in adex since then. the issue isnt the price of fees, it is losing those fees


[22-Sep-21 11:37 AM] RandiMcRandom#3232
ive seen that etherscan to see the gas fees, but myself and others wouldnt know to swap to a bep20 eth, and even then, its not the same eth im sending from a atm/other cex/etc


[22-Sep-21 11:37 AM] RandiMcRandom#3232
there should be something for lost swaps/way to recover fees is all im saying


[22-Sep-21 11:37 AM] RandiMcRandom#3232
you would ever go into coinbase pro, place an order, and just have your fee taken


[22-Sep-21 11:38 AM] RandiMcRandom#3232
or any other big name for that matter. i understand its not peer to peer and not the same


[22-Sep-21 11:39 AM] RandiMcRandom#3232
cause a $10 eth fee for a $1k swap is nothing, i would rather pay the $10 fee than the 5% difference because of only a few swaps on adex.. the % id have to pay to swap from erc to bep would outweigh the actual eth gas fee by a LONG shot


[22-Sep-21 11:39 AM] RandiMcRandom#3232
just my thoughts since we need more users on adex


[22-Sep-21 11:45 AM] Slyris#2880
At some point you will mostly swap ETH on L2 (optimism/arbitrum) or side chains (polygon, bsc, ftm, avax) to reduce the fees


[22-Sep-21 11:46 AM] Slyris#2880
You will be able to just choose the ethereum that's suits you, maybe do one big swap from L1 to L2 without going through a bridge within adex

Hey all, I have Polymath in my AtomicDEX that doesn't show any value anymore after the latest update. Coingecko id and everything seems fine but no value for my coins. Any idea what's going on? Is it a bug?


[23-Sep-21 02:28 AM] Slyris#2880
Polymath is not supported yet in adex. <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/dev/assets/config/0.5.2-coins.json>

Custom tokens doesn't have price support anymore, because we do not use the same price service anymore.

[27-Sep-21 10:47 PM] find_your_way#5266
Yeah i understand but as i understand correct the sense behind warrrr is to have a bridge from kmd and other coins to arrrr right? So if you now only can store warrrr on adex it makes no sense to me because in the end i cant go over the bridge....maybe i missing something? Its like to buy a car but dont have a driver licence....is it planed to make smart contract compatible?


[27-Sep-21 10:49 PM] Slyris#2880
But you should ask on the Pirate discord why they do not communicate at all with us before doing their non standard ERC20 contract then? I don't understand why blaming us '_'


[27-Sep-21 10:51 PM] find_your_way#5266
Non o...you understand wrong...no blaming...i only read about the announcement of warrr and ask what it means because i dont understand


[27-Sep-21 10:52 PM] Slyris#2880
To answer your technical question i think it's possible to fix it from our side by hardcoding the fees they take away, not sure if it's a priority, you should wait for an answer from @TonyL on this topic. But it's a bit the same with the USDT-ERC20 contract that act the same way.


[27-Sep-21 10:52 PM] find_your_way#5266
Im sorry you thing i blaming you...thats not what i want...only want to understand the announcement and what it neans for kmd community...and i also give my opinion because i understand that there is a vehicle but i cant use it....thats all


[27-Sep-21 10:54 PM] Slyris#2880
I think it's possible to solve it as i've said, not sure it's a priority at all for the moment - what i can tell you is that real ARRRtomic swaps will come at the end of the year normally - meanwhile this time it's always good to have wallet possibility in atomicdex

What I find sad is that if a discussion had been initiated before by the Pirate team we could have told them before the contract was deployed that it would not work in atomicDEX.


[27-Sep-21 11:01 PM] find_your_way#5266
Yeah its ok...but maybe next time announcing something like this...."warrr is now available on adex. What this means for you? You can store Warrrr on dex but trading against other coins is not possible because of...."

I think this is very transparent and everyone understand this

yes, it's normal... ARRR-BEP20 uses non-standard contract that sends 1% of every tx to some other addresses. ADEX expects the full amount though, so swaps fail: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/1078
only wallet mode

[28-Sep-21 01:32 AM] TonyL#3577
besides of implementation on protocol side that's makes things difficult for interface as well - e.g. need to explain users why do they need 1% more and etc

üëç 

[28-Sep-21 01:58 AM] jansako#3330
Yeah, the extra 1% goes half to a dev fund & half to liquidity providers on the pancake swap LP. It  is really strange that ALL transactions would have 1% fee... I read it in Pirate discord but I assumed that only the LP-related transactions would have that fee, not simply 'send wARRR from one address to another' type transactions...


[28-Sep-21 01:59 AM] Slyris#2880
In our case since we need to send 2 tx, it's even 2%...

[28-Sep-21 05:18 AM] Komodefi#5638
It's a pretty heavy handed move imo. They put a dev tax on warrr and fundamentally altered it's tokenomics. I suppose they have their portal but since it's a complete black box with no real explanation on how it works I'm reluctant to try it. ```The fee to convert ARRR to wARRR is 0.5 ARRR. The fee to convert wARRR to ARRR is 0.5 wARRR.
(This does fluctuate depending on the ARRR price if it goes up the fees will be reduced and vice-versa)``` I'm not even sure what this means exactly, or how the swap would even be possible in adex.


[28-Sep-21 05:21 AM] CHMEX#0686
It means if you use the centralized gateway there is a fee of approx 2USD to convert


[28-Sep-21 05:25 AM] Komodefi#5638
how centralized is the gateway? is it automated?


[28-Sep-21 05:26 AM] CHMEX#0686
what I heard yes it's automated


[28-Sep-21 05:30 AM] Komodefi#5638
the whole utility argument for wARRR is predicated on the anonymity/security of that portal. Pirate's team should address that in the faq. Would suck to pay extra fees just to end up getting ip tagged.

i am looking for something like imgbb..i dont want register on youtube


[30-Sep-21 12:59 AM] find_your_way#5266
mhh..than i try to explain the problem...when i click on an asset or coin in my wallet or in dashboard than "fetching transaction" begins and need very long (up to 2 Minutes). Meanwhile i cant click on another asset or coin...i have to wait until "fetching transaction" ends. in 0.5.1 i dont had this problem and fetching transaction was very fast (1 second).


[30-Sep-21 01:58 AM] TonyL#3577
thats not ok, does it happen for some specific coin/asset on your side?


[30-Sep-21 01:58 AM] find_your_way#5266
no...every coin has long "fetching transaction" time


[30-Sep-21 02:00 AM] TonyL#3577
could you please send me a log files in DM? (settings -> general -> logs)


[30-Sep-21 02:30 AM] find_your_way#5266
i found the solution...reset asset config works üôÇ is it possible to make an auto resset asset config when update to a newer version?


[30-Sep-21 02:43 AM] Slyris#2880
there is, but it's a soft one


[30-Sep-21 02:48 AM] find_your_way#5266
that means? whats difference between soft and hard one?


[30-Sep-21 02:49 AM] Slyris#2880
Hard one disable all your coins and keep the default one, soft one update your current cfg to the last one and preserve the enabled coins


[30-Sep-21 03:04 AM] find_your_way#5266
okey thanks...i hope others dont have the problem with soft asset reset

[30-Sep-21 05:40 AM] uak#6718
it requires cmake `3.18` but on 20.04 there is only `cmake version 3.16.3`
There is no install instruction for those. @Slyris could you please share your settings?


[30-Sep-21 07:11 AM] Slyris#2880
@uak there is standalone download: <https://cmake.org/download/>


[30-Sep-21 07:12 AM] uak#6718
yeah noticed that, what about other issues?


[30-Sep-21 07:14 AM] Slyris#2880
normally they should be present


[30-Sep-21 07:15 AM] Slyris#2880
https://github.com/miurahr/aqtinstall/blob/372113fe9df9dbe0ec0d943fe64b08a06daec554/aqt/combinations.json#L109 maybe not anymore but you can just skip them


[30-Sep-21 07:16 AM] uak#6718
ok


[30-Sep-21 07:16 AM] uak#6718
will try without them


[30-Sep-21 11:26 AM] RNI#2666
hey komodo team. since v.0.5.1 i can't claim my kmd rewards anymore and all my transactions are gone..they don't show up anymore.
when switching to another coin (vrsc p.ex) it say "fetching transactions" and nothing happens. i can't even switch to another coin anymore.
any suggestions?


[30-Sep-21 11:29 AM] RNI#2666
@Slyris


[30-Sep-21 01:15 PM] Slyris#2880
Hello I'm trying to reproduce your problem locally on the last 0.5.2, by switching between different coins in the wallet, but the issue is not happening. Have you tried by any chance to reset the assets configurations? (I'm actually switching between Komodo and Verus)


[30-Sep-21 01:26 PM] RNI#2666
hi @Slyris i will give it a try


[30-Sep-21 01:27 PM] RNI#2666
where to reset assets configurations?


[30-Sep-21 01:27 PM] Slyris#2880
In the settings!


[30-Sep-21 01:28 PM] RNI#2666
reset wallet config?

[30-Sep-21 01:30 PM] RNI#2666
and none of my past transactions are shown anymore


[30-Sep-21 01:30 PM] RNI#2666
its stuck again


[30-Sep-21 01:31 PM] RNI#2666
can't switch from vrsc to another coin anymore


[30-Sep-21 01:31 PM] RNI#2666
no reaction


[30-Sep-21 01:32 PM] RNI#2666
when i installed 0.5.0 to buy tkl it already showed strange transactions.. like if i bought 2000 tkl on september 2019


[30-Sep-21 01:32 PM] RNI#2666
and it took one hour to load assets when i started atomic dex


[30-Sep-21 01:33 PM] RNI#2666
then i installed that fix from github..


[30-Sep-21 01:33 PM] RNI#2666
and now 0.5.1


[30-Sep-21 01:33 PM] RNI#2666
and now it doesn't seem to work properly at all anymore


[30-Sep-21 01:34 PM] RNI#2666
ah now it switched to vrsc and it shows the tx's ... after like 7 minutes of waiting


[30-Sep-21 01:35 PM] Slyris#2880
hmm


[30-Sep-21 01:35 PM] Slyris#2880
probably an electrum problem, if you see this spinner it's means that it's syncing your transactions


[30-Sep-21 01:35 PM] RNI#2666
ok


[30-Sep-21 01:35 PM] RNI#2666
yes it's strange. i never had problems with atomicdex. it always worked flawless


[30-Sep-21 01:36 PM] RNI#2666
but since i installed 0.5.0 to buy tokel, its not working properly anymore. everything takes so long to react.


[30-Sep-21 01:36 PM] Slyris#2880
maybe it's just the electrum from VRSC


[30-Sep-21 01:37 PM] Slyris#2880
Oh you are right, if i enable tokel and vrsc i start to see this spinner, but for a short amount of time


[30-Sep-21 01:37 PM] RNI#2666
when i click on "claim rewards" for kmd  that spinner comes too ... and it takes about 5 minutes before it shows the informations about my rewards


[30-Sep-21 01:38 PM] Slyris#2880
Me too @RNI


[30-Sep-21 01:38 PM] Slyris#2880
if i disable VRSC and TKL it's instant


[30-Sep-21 01:39 PM] Slyris#2880
Hey @cipi could you check if there is any slow request response from electrum side right now?


[30-Sep-21 01:39 PM] RNI#2666
ahh ok


[30-Sep-21 01:39 PM] RNI#2666
so it has something to do with vrsc?

[30-Sep-21 01:40 PM] Slyris#2880
i do not think so, i have slow loading time on claim rewards too, it's was not the case before but i do not think that's from the 0.5.2


[30-Sep-21 01:41 PM] RNI#2666
0.5.2? i'm on 0.5.1-beta ... it say i'm on the latest version

We've disabled the self update on windows


[30-Sep-21 01:42 PM] RNI#2666
oh ok. i will update immediately üëç


[30-Sep-21 01:42 PM] RNI#2666
yeah the self update on windows downloaded the new version but never installed it


[30-Sep-21 01:42 PM] Slyris#2880
yep


[30-Sep-21 01:43 PM] Slyris#2880
for me it take ~30 seconds for claiming rewards


[30-Sep-21 01:43 PM] Slyris#2880
but it used to be instant


[30-Sep-21 01:44 PM] Slyris#2880
yeah now it's instant for me for example


[30-Sep-21 01:46 PM] RNI#2666
installed 0.5.2 now. loads assets instantly .. but still all my kmd transactions are missing


[30-Sep-21 01:46 PM] Slyris#2880
do you see a small spinner that says "loading tx history" ?


[30-Sep-21 01:46 PM] RNI#2666
no


[30-Sep-21 01:46 PM] RNI#2666
"no transactions"


[30-Sep-21 01:47 PM] Slyris#2880
If you have no tx that doesn't mean they dissapear, that mean they doesn't load


[30-Sep-21 01:48 PM] RNI#2666
yeah but why don't they load? 
in till 0.5.0 i saw all my previous kmd tx's instantly


[30-Sep-21 01:48 PM] RNI#2666
i wonder what happened


[30-Sep-21 01:48 PM] Slyris#2880

[30-Sep-21 03:13 PM] CHMEX#0686
@Slyris any idea how to convert a KMD address with ETH with mm2?
there is convert_address but somehow doesnt work with ETH


[30-Sep-21 03:13 PM] CHMEX#0686
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783/" --data "{"userpass":"$userpass","method":"convertaddress","coin":"KMD","from","RXL3YXG2ceaB6C5hfJcN4fvmLH2C34knhA", "to_address_format":{"format":"mixedcase"}}"


[30-Sep-21 05:48 PM] CHMEX#0686
never mind looks like it's not supposed to be used for that


[30-Sep-21 09:53 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
Yes, it's supposed to convert addresses between different format in the *single coin context*. Conversion from UTXO address to ETH is barely possible without knowing the public key as they use different hashing algorithms. You have to revert rimepd160 and sha256 hashes for this üôÇ

My grandma even use Facebook  üòâ


[01-Oct-21 02:52 AM] Slyris#2880
I'm not really sure what the problem is, but I think it's the size of its history that cause the problem, that's why I want to check first if it can execute the command in CLI


[01-Oct-21 03:16 AM] RNI#2666

I've had a lot of issues with placing orders. My order doesn't appear, my past transaction history and current orders don't appear either


[01-Oct-21 09:37 PM] Slyris#2880
Hello Pringle, are you using 0.5.2, and do you have many coins enabled and many orders?


[01-Oct-21 10:20 PM] Pringle#4720
yes using .5.2.. On;y have 4 coins enabled


[01-Oct-21 10:22 PM] Pringle#4720
switching through Exchange rates, orders and History sometime doesn't display anything. Sometimes in take 5mins for anything to display. This has been occurring in previous versions too


[01-Oct-21 11:38 PM] uak#6718
@Pringle maybe provide screen shoot or record screen?


[02-Oct-21 02:02 AM] Slyris#2880
Are you on Windows?


[02-Oct-21 02:15 AM] Slyris#2880
What I recommend in these cases if you don't care about the swap history is to do a wipeout. Keep your `seed phrase` aside, open the logs folder from the application settings, go to the parent folder (on windows it's `atomic_qt`) - close the application, then delete the `atomic_qt` folder, and launch the application again. Once the application is launch, import your wallet again with the `seed phrase`. There is currently a bug on the price provider (timeout) which will be resolved this evening.

I do not know the particularity of the actions carried out on your application, but the number of swaps, the size of the transaction history can surely slow down the actions, the idea is to see if after these wipeout actions the application is fast again for you.

Currently what I can tell you is that we are trying to fetch the last 1000 transactions by the time you go to the asset page - normally it shouldn't be huge for this kind of program, but if it causes a problem I could transform this value into settings and only take for example the last 10 transactions.


[02-Oct-21 03:17 AM] jansako#3330
@Slyris if that helps any, I have ~450 transactions in my wallet dating back about a year, 14 assets enabled & all responses are 'instant'. Win 10, only about 360 megs of RAM in use by atomicdex.exe


[02-Oct-21 03:18 AM] Slyris#2880
Thanks for the highlight @jansako


[02-Oct-21 03:20 AM] jansako#3330
It's got kind of a beast i7-7900K server processor & 64 G of Ram, not sure if that makes any difference in pushing the performance lag appearance

For those of you who use a firewall for adex, whitelisting these tcp ports worked for me: ‚Äò80, 443, 1313, 3333:3335, 8555, 10000:10100, 38890‚Äô

Lol, open by default, although you‚Äôd probably  be fine with only 443 allowed. I just put in here as I caught a few connection attempts using port 80. Never received an answer re. the required tcp ports for adex, so I‚Äôm just guessing adex probes port 80 first and then moves on to 443?!

you might need to add some more ports after adding assets.. each coins has some specific tcp ports


[03-Oct-21 02:50 PM] h6y34ui98#1695
Correct. I‚Äôm running a monitoring tool in the background to catch any failed connection attempts. Is there a documentation for the adex network architecture somewhere ?

my first suggestion will be to check if your machine has its time set correctly


[04-Oct-21 12:36 AM] jansako#3330
"10s timed out waiting for the future to complete" this is funny :-). But for real, maybe a bit better error description would be order.


[04-Oct-21 06:06 AM] cipi#4502
that's a timeout from the VRSC electrum servers when calling `blockchain.scripthash.get_balance`
either networking or slow servers... someone from VRSC should take a look at the load on those electrum servers

Is rpc_clients:2097 the destination tcp port for that particular coin on the electrum server? I was assuming this may be usually in the range 10000-10100? Just trying to understand the network side of things.

Can you insert Recovery passphrase from Coinomi into DEX? is it compatible?


[05-Oct-21 11:46 AM] gcharang#6833
not right now. you have to export wif/privatekey from coinomi and import it to atomicdex. if the txn fees aren't high for the involved coins, you might just want to send them from coinomi to your atomicdex address

[06-Oct-21 11:32 AM] jansako#3330
'probably' an old version of Adex & it won't match. There could be other reasons, a lot of the cheapest orders were not matching for me & then out of the blue a 0.045 one matched...

Swap is not going through. Checked the log and i see a lot of these: lp_ordermatch:2320] WARN Received zero or hashed_null_node pair KMD:SMTF trie root from pub xxxxxxxxxxxxxx


[07-Oct-21 05:34 AM] cipi#4502
you can ignore that warning, nothing to do with non matching orders
what are you trying to swap? there are couple reasons why an order does not match:
- maker has set a min_volume for that order and you are trying to trade less then the min_volume
- maker has banned you (previous failed swaps with that maker)
- maker is running ancient ADEX version with bugs


[07-Oct-21 05:34 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
SMFT to KMD


[07-Oct-21 05:35 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
Upgraded to newest version but still the same


[07-Oct-21 05:35 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
Min_volume was not a issue i think (no ! was seen as i saw on some other pairs with a minimum order amount)


[07-Oct-21 05:36 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
Banning is no issue too i think, is my second swap i tried with this wallet


[07-Oct-21 05:38 AM] cipi#4502
ADEX Desktop does not show you the min_volume of the order... there is only a warning if your balance is lower then the min_volume... but if your balance is 100, min_volume is 50 and you try to swap 10 it will not show you any error/warning, it will let you place the order which then simply does not match
but anyway, the bids in SMTF/KMD orderbook are likely from me, they don't have a min_volume set, so reason must be something else


[07-Oct-21 05:38 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
Overall the Dextop feels buggie (open orders not showing and then they become visible), orderbook from wrong pair showing after change of pair


[07-Oct-21 05:39 AM] cipi#4502
i don't have any of these problems, sounds weird


[07-Oct-21 05:39 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
the last version loads faster though, that's a improvement


[07-Oct-21 05:42 AM] cipi#4502
sounds la bit ike a performance issue... delays in orderbook loading and such
never had this on my PC, but i am on Linux, always worked better then anything else


[07-Oct-21 05:42 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
You would think that yea, but mem use, cpu use are low and stable


[07-Oct-21 05:42 AM] cipi#4502
how many coins have you enabled?


[07-Oct-21 05:43 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
Wallet part of the program runs like clockwork


[07-Oct-21 05:43 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
5


[07-Oct-21 05:43 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
It's the DEX part that has the issues


[07-Oct-21 05:44 AM] cipi#4502
hmmm, i have like 100 üôÇ ... only becomes relevant when over 100 or so, afaik


[07-Oct-21 05:45 AM] cipi#4502
could it be related to networking? DEX part needs to "talk" to ADEX seed nodes to get the orderbook


[07-Oct-21 05:45 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
i have cabled internet, glass. Runs like a charm


[07-Oct-21 05:46 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
But you say you are the one that put the orders?


[07-Oct-21 05:46 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222

[07-Oct-21 05:48 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
You put the bid of 1.052631 KMD per SMFT?


[07-Oct-21 05:48 AM] cipi#4502
i run a marketmaker script, it places and updates orders based on price from different sources with a configured spread
i added SMTF to the config, so there are couple of orders in different orderbooks
let me see...


[07-Oct-21 05:49 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
Oke, in general it would be nice to have more info as a user on why a swap is failing


[07-Oct-21 05:50 AM] cipi#4502
no, my first one is 0.94, the 1.05 one is from someone else


[07-Oct-21 05:52 AM] cipi#4502
the swap is not failing, it just doesn't start because the matching fails
i opened an issue in ADEX github about min_volume problems with orders: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/issues/1275


[07-Oct-21 05:52 AM] cipi#4502
i guess your problem is exactly this


[07-Oct-21 05:52 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
yeah oke, i saw that i got placed on the asks in stead of matching


[07-Oct-21 05:53 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
But that does not make sense to me (a noob) as i "selected" a order to swap with, i do not expect it to be placed in the book


[07-Oct-21 05:53 AM] cipi#4502
try the 0.94 order, with low volume, i am pretty sure it will match


[07-Oct-21 05:54 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
Ill try


[07-Oct-21 05:54 AM] cipi#4502
ADEX Desktop tries to match against the orders already in orderbook... if that does not work after some time (20s or so), it turns that order into a maker order and places it into orderbook


[07-Oct-21 05:54 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
That is strange as well, in the order tab there is nothing


[07-Oct-21 05:55 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
i Tried to swap 10


[07-Oct-21 05:55 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
But i see nothing


[07-Oct-21 05:56 AM] cipi#4502
ADEX API supports order types like "FillOrKill", but not implemented in ADEX Desktop yet... this would prevent a non-matching taker order being "converted" to a maker order


[07-Oct-21 05:56 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
That would be a nice feature with a checkbox option


[07-Oct-21 05:56 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
Guess my order for 10SMFT to KMD did not go through?


[07-Oct-21 05:57 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
Don't see it anywhere


[07-Oct-21 05:58 AM] cipi#4502
me neither... but hey, do you have BNB in your balance? to send SMTF you need some BNB to pay the txfees on the BEP20 chain

[07-Oct-21 06:02 AM] cipi#4502
yes, i have a delay too sometimes... swap starts and it takes couple seconds to show up in orders... but the delay is more like 1-3s


[07-Oct-21 06:04 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
Still no orders, earlier today it eventually became visible but stayed at 0/3


[07-Oct-21 06:05 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
Took very long time too


[07-Oct-21 06:07 AM] cipi#4502
that is really strange
btw, looked up the 1.05 order in CLI orderbook
```
  "bids": [
    {
      "coin": "KMD",
      "address": "RFaamYRCuCyFnxz6kGXz4p3YemGEvzJPin",
      "price": "1.052631578947368421052631578947368421052631578947368421052631578947368421052631578947368421052631579",
      "maxvolume": "489",
      "min_volume": "0.000105",
      "pubkey": "036a056d812dfab62e9b5d8d6a3b08059de0a36ee968d78d1c9414f1c1926c015e",
```
min_volume is 0.000105, so that is not the problem why it does not match... maybe that maker ran out of BNB himself... or it uses 0.5.1 ADEX (there was a hotfix in 0.5.2 regarding BEP20 ordermatching)... let me see


[07-Oct-21 06:10 AM] cipi#4502
https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/1074
i guess the maker with the 1.05 order is running a version prior to this fix


[07-Oct-21 06:10 AM] cipi#4502
it's exactly the same case... UTXO (KMD) to BEP20 (SMTF) does not match


[07-Oct-21 06:11 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
Well in my case its BEP20 to UTXO but i guess thats the same?


[07-Oct-21 06:14 AM] cipi#4502
i guess it's the same problem, since for the maker of that order is's the opposite case, sell KMD for SMTF üôÇ


[07-Oct-21 06:14 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
Order still not visible btw, very weird indeed


[07-Oct-21 06:15 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
SMFT balance changed, BNB balance changed a little bit but other than that i have no indication a swap is ongoing


[07-Oct-21 06:15 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
Now it popped in


[07-Oct-21 06:15 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
2/3


[07-Oct-21 06:16 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
complaining helps i guess but i have no clue what the reason is, for some reason that part of the program does not load properly


[07-Oct-21 06:17 AM] cipi#4502
swap is ongoing... seeing `| (21:31) [swap uuid=8cea8155-34f0-4feb-a340-687db12f943e] Maker payment sent...` in console of my maker... it waits for your node to accept my KMD payment i guess
yes, that is a strange problem... what OS are you using?

In transaction details it shows i lost some dust on SMFT and BNB


[07-Oct-21 06:26 AM] cipi#4502
your node is waiting for my KMD... i assume you started the swap with default settings... this means it waits for the KMD tx to be notarized and that can take 30 minutes


[07-Oct-21 06:26 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
In the order tab it shows 2/3 again


[07-Oct-21 06:27 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
it went like: gone -> 2/3 - 0/3 - gone - 2/3


[07-Oct-21 06:27 AM] cipi#4502
you can also change this settings for the receiving coin in a swap... on swap confirmation page there is `custom protection settings`

yes, you can disable the waiting for notarizations on KMD by disabling "enable Komodo dPoW security"... less secure (51% attacks), but much faster... 3 simple confirmations take ~ 3 minutes, a notarization takes 30 üôÇ

39 minutes now on that step


[07-Oct-21 06:33 AM] cipi#4502
also depends on the chain... looks like there are gaps in KMD blocks: https://kmdexplorer.io/


[07-Oct-21 06:33 AM] cipi#4502
blocktime should be 1 minute... only 5 blocks in the last 25 minutes though... damn


[07-Oct-21 06:35 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
At least my 9KMD are very secure üòÖ


[07-Oct-21 06:40 AM] cipi#4502
yes üôÇ ... and it gets better, the last 5 blocks took only 6 minutes


[07-Oct-21 06:40 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
Would be nice to have a feature on that last screen to show the expected transaction times for both options


[07-Oct-21 06:40 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
If i knew this i would have opted for that faster one


[07-Oct-21 06:41 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
Think the average joe would be frustrated if a low value swap took this long


[07-Oct-21 06:41 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
Or maybe even show a option to a other coin with a even faster transaction time


[07-Oct-21 06:45 AM] cipi#4502
indeed, there were some thoughts about disabling dPoW for low volume swaps by default
i guess there is a github issue for that too somewhere üôÇ
the estimation is a bit difficult, you can only do it by using the defined block time of the particular coin, but the reality can be different, like in this case (defined blocktime of KMD is 1 minute, but there were 15 minutes gaps between blocks in the last hour)


[07-Oct-21 06:46 AM] cipi#4502
swap is finished on my end


[07-Oct-21 06:49 AM] cipi#4502
hmmm, i guess the problem was to determine what a "low volume swap" actually is... you need the prices of the involved coins to calculate this


[07-Oct-21 06:50 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
i see, for smft there is no price


[07-Oct-21 06:51 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222

[07-Oct-21 06:57 AM] cipi#4502
the KMD show up even with 0 confirmations, i guess in some situations it is before ADEX declares the swap as completed


[07-Oct-21 06:58 AM] cipi#4502
someone from SMTF should ask coinpaprika to add SMTF... ADEX uses coingecko, coinpaprika and Binance for price infos

should be OK, since the swap is already done (funds sent)


[07-Oct-21 07:48 AM] cipi#4502
which chain? which settings (how many confirmations)? look at blockexplorer, maybe there are bigger gaps between blocks on that chain.


[07-Oct-21 08:14 AM] BitSec#1898
@cipi how do you mean what chain? 195 confirmations.


[07-Oct-21 08:14 AM] BitSec#1898
It's the TOKEL coin


[07-Oct-21 08:24 AM] cipi#4502
likely using default settings too... so when you buy TKL, it will wait for a notarization of that tx
but that was surely already there during the 195 confirmations... problem is likely that other party dropped out (turned off ADEX or something)


[07-Oct-21 08:25 AM] cipi#4502
if you sent me the swap uuid, i can look if the seed nodes have any infos about that swap
you can also check https://dexapi.cipig.net/public/error.php?uuid=a4b6870c-facc-4213-aff3-6ba424771041 (replace uuid by your own)... info is only there if at least one of the parties finished the swap (successful or failed)

[07-Oct-21 08:29 AM] cipi#4502
that is normal when neither of the 2 parties sent anything to the seed node (where the info is coming from)
your node still thinks it could finish the swap successfully (it will timeout), so hasn't sent anything to the seed node... and the other party seems to be off (ADEX stoped or lost connection), so it hasn't sent anything either

Another strange order in atomicDex:  16.13587615 KMD    229.93623514 TKL    0.07017544 ( swap fails with error waiting for 'maker-payment') 
Is banning a maker node a standard behavior of atomicDex in that case? 
BTW, this node has loooots of orders on TKL/KDM.
https://dexstats.info/gui/index.php?base=TKL&rel=KMD


[07-Oct-21 11:15 AM] cipi#4502
the maker didn't/couldn't send maker payment... maybe you can see his error on https://dexapi.cipig.net/public/error.php?uuid=8861fb06-82bc-4579-a95b-7d8a702f7109 (replace uuid with your own)
yes, in this case your node will ban that maker after swap failed, had the same with same maker üôÇ


[07-Oct-21 11:18 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
After this node got banned almost all sell orders disappeared from the orderbook... üôÇ

is it already in refund mode? or still waiting for swap to complete?

It's still counting xD Not in refund mode as far as I can see


[07-Oct-21 12:19 PM] cipi#4502
hmmm, strange... could be an edge case like yesterday... node sent tx, but that was removed from mempool because it took too long for the next block to be mined
you can simply restart the app and see what happens
or let it run and don't care, sooner or later it will clear up one way or the other üôÇ

[07-Oct-21 12:42 PM] BitSec#1898
luckily it wasn't that much money anyways


[07-Oct-21 12:46 PM] cipi#4502
funds were not sent anyway, because it goes like this
1. taker sends TakerFee
2. maker sends MakerPayment
3. taker sends TakerPayment
so if you were taker and maker has failed to send MakerPayment (step 2), the swap does not advance to step 3 (you send TakerPayment)
so there is nothing to refund... TakerFee is lost anyway, that is not refundable


[08-Oct-21 02:38 AM] find_your_way#5266
So why not step "send taker fee" change to position 3 after maker payment and Taker payment was send?


[08-Oct-21 03:24 AM] michelvankessel#7656
I was thinking the same!


[08-Oct-21 03:27 AM] michelvankessel#7656
my BLK/KMD taker swap failed after a few minutes. taker_swap:967] Error waiting for 'maker-payment' data: lp_swap:223] Timeout (271 > 270)


[08-Oct-21 05:10 AM] cipi#4502
that's how the atomic swap protocol works... takerfee is sent first to prevent spamming by malicious takers... initiating a swap (by sending takerfee) will also make the maker send the makerpayment... if taker shuts down his ADEX, the makerpayment is stuck for hours before refund... if this doesn't cost anything, i could make all makers lock all their funds up for hours... and for free


[08-Oct-21 05:29 AM] find_your_way#5266
Ok that make sense...thanks for easy example üëç

But in case its a good taker but maker is malicious the taker lost money...so the risk is on taker side or is it possible to change the protocol that in case of malicious maker the maker must pay the fee?


[08-Oct-21 05:43 AM] cipi#4502
yes, taker looses takerfee in this situation... to mitigate the effect, ADEX bans that maker after the first failed swap, so no more orders from this maker visible and no swaps can be started with it
i don't think changing protocol is viable
there was this: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/675 but i guess that is hard to implement and not really economically feasible... think of a ETH takerfee tx... ETH sent 0.1$, but txfee for sending 0.1$ of ETH on ETH chain is 30$... so to return 0.1$ of ETH back to taker someone will have to pay the 30$ txfee üôÇ


[08-Oct-21 05:45 AM] cipi#4502
actually, it would be possible when taker uses double the txfee for sending takerfee tx... in case swap fails, the fee can be returned to taker by using the txfee already payed... but this means to pay 2x txfee for every takerfee tx, just in case swap fails...

I thought the latest release was going to get rid of the geo blocking in the US, what happened? What compliance is forcing this? Is there an explanation anywhere?


[08-Oct-21 07:14 AM] cipi#4502
idk, simply use https://github.com/marmarachain/atomicDEX-Desktop/releases, it's the same with geoblocking off


[08-Oct-21 07:18 AM] find_your_way#5266
Ok...that is a good solution to be honest...so only the first person loose fee.

Sometimes there are maker orders and when you take them nothing happened and your takeorder change to maker orders...whats wrong with this maker orders?


[08-Oct-21 07:21 AM] cipi#4502
some of them have a min_volume set, which you can't see in GUI... if min_volume is set to 100 and you try to buy 10 coins, orders will not match
when a taker order (buy/sell) does not match within idk 20s or so, it will be turned into a maker order and appear in orderbook... like on a CEX with "good till cancelled" order (default)


[08-Oct-21 07:24 AM] find_your_way#5266
Ok also understand...so is there a reason why we cant see minimum order? Is it planed for future? Or maybe a notification "minimum order is ..." is needed

There are some problems with balances in my atomicDex app. Balance of every asset in $ is zero (dashboard tab). What could be the reason of that?

[09-Oct-21 05:44 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
I also noticed a problem with notifications, am not getting receive/sent notification.


[09-Oct-21 05:44 AM] Slyris#2880
Likely because we check if the balance in fiat change for receive/sent


[09-Oct-21 05:44 AM] Slyris#2880
And since you don't have balance in fiat, you don't have notification

Atomic does not show received/sent notification and also does not update balances.

To see correct balance you need to log out and log in again or use API.

realized one thing while playing with these other DEXs: you can't do more swaps in parallel on those... after starting one you need to wait for it to complete or to fail/timeout... i guess all those chains have the same limitation since they are copies of ERC20
need to set the timeout lower, to not wait 20 minutes to be able to start a new swap... lol


[09-Oct-21 07:24 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes tx are serialized on eth


[09-Oct-21 07:24 PM] cipi#4502
this must be the future üôÇ ... one pending tx/swap blocks everything... and since it's a single chain, it affects all tokens on that chain


[09-Oct-21 07:56 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
There is a benefit though over utxo chains and that is can use same funds more than once per block.  Flash loans are a good example of this


[09-Oct-21 07:59 PM] cipi#4502
not sure if i would call flash loans a "benefit" üòÑ

@Slyris  - Feature request.  At the top of the Atomic DEX gui there is the user name with a icon next to it of a person.  It would be cool to be able to link this to a NFT in Tokel, so you can have a custom profile picture that is a NFT.


[10-Oct-21 12:14 AM] jspook16#3059
Not just a picture. The nft data could be your user name in the crypto space. Build some rep

Any artist could make an Atomic DEX skin then sell on TOKEL.


[10-Oct-21 12:39 AM] Corellian Engineering#8439
I guess there ways to gamify, like do 1000 swaps recieve a special NFT as a reward


[10-Oct-21 12:40 AM] Slyris#2880
To be honest with you NFT support is not the priority ATM.

Expect: Trading Bot, Offline Staking, WebDEX and ARRR swaps for this year

[10-Oct-21 03:23 PM] Regnar#6164
Got a question for the AtomicDEX api. If you issue a `buy` at a specific UUID, what API call do you use to monitor the status of that swap?
I issue a buy order for a specific UUID and get a response kinda like this:
`{'result': {'base': 'RVN', 'rel': 'KMD', 'base_amount': '100', 'rel_amount': '10', 'action': 'Buy', 'uuid': 'THE_UUID_I_GET_IN_RESPONSE', 'match_by': {'type': 'Orders', 'data': ['$UUIDtoBuy']}`

 and then try `my_swap_status` with the UUID i get in response, but am getting this response `{"error":"swap data is not found"}`


[10-Oct-21 03:24 PM] Regnar#6164
<https://docs.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.html#my-swap-status>
I'm using this because the docs said the params uuid is `the uuid of swap, typically received from the buy/sell call`


[10-Oct-21 06:34 PM] uak#6718
Thanks, but even BTC is not a default coin. I've just disabled it. can I open a PR to remove the sticky state from LTC?


[10-Oct-21 06:40 PM] uak#6718
seems like both LTC and BTC have: `"active": true,` in `0.5.2-coins.json` but for some reason I can disable BTC but not LTC


[10-Oct-21 07:05 PM] cipi#4502
hmmm, ok, thought that setting would prevent disabling... but looks like i was wrong
need to aks @Slyris or @syl

LTC is a default coin you can't disable it

[11-Oct-21 08:59 AM] Regnar#6164
hmm still getting errors on `my_swap_status` anyone have any ideas on which AtomicDEX API to monitor the status of an order? I'm attempting to buy an order specifically by UUID. After calling `buy` the buy order appears in AtomicDEX and begins, I receive the UUID from the `buy` api, but I'm unable to monitor the swap via the APIs using `my_swap_status` with that UUID. I instead get `{"error":"swap data is not found"}`


[11-Oct-21 09:45 AM] cipi#4502
you are likely using the wrong uuid, there is an order uuid and a swap uuid... the maker order also his own uuid... after your taker order matches the maker order, a swap is created and that gets a different uuid... you need to use that one to watch the status of your swap


[11-Oct-21 09:47 AM] CHMEX#0686
looks like you use webworkers tools?
./my_recent


[11-Oct-21 09:47 AM] CHMEX#0686
that uuid has to be used


[11-Oct-21 09:48 AM] Regnar#6164
okay so in the response here is `result.uuid` <https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.html#buy> that's the uuid for the order, but not the swap?


[11-Oct-21 09:52 AM] Regnar#6164
Just to see if I'm following, `order` is to describe when you have made a request to sell or attempt to buy, and `swap` is when it's been matched and the swap has begun? So if I use `buy` and give an order uuid that I would specifically like to purchase, the response of `buy` has a uuid and that is actually an `order` uuid. Then at some point, a swap uuid is provided that shows the current ongoing swap?


[11-Oct-21 09:56 AM] cipi#4502
yes, by the time the buy order is issued, you can't know that it will match


[11-Oct-21 10:05 AM] Regnar#6164
so I can issue a buy for a specific order uuid, but that doesn't mean it will match that uuid (but likely will if it meets the requirements, price, minimum, max etc) and what do I do to check if I actually matched and what the status of the swap is? poll `order_status.order.matches` ?

Could someone explain why is that big difference in BNB fees when you compare sending USDT with swapping USDT? Send 100 USDT fee is $0.08 (BNB) vs swap 100 USDT for KMD fee is $0.92 (BNB).


[13-Oct-21 10:57 AM] cipi#4502
because the swap contains more then one tx... depending on if you are taker or maker and what your takercoin is... the transactions sent during a swap are also more complicated then a simple tx, so they are using more gas
look at https://etherscan.io/gastracker (for ETH, but similar for every other ERC20 chain)


[13-Oct-21 10:58 AM] cipi#4502
there are 2 values... ERC20 transfer is 20$, uniswap swap is 60$ (which is similar to ADEX)

[13-Oct-21 11:01 AM] cipi#4502
if you swap USDT for KMD, you send TakerFee in USDT, that's the first tx (i guess that one uses a rather small fee of 0.08), but then there is TakerPayment in USDT, that one will use more gas and be more expensive


[13-Oct-21 11:09 AM] cipi#4502
not sure if the expectation from ADEX is correct, since this is such a TakerPayment tx in USDT... it used only 59% of the supplied gas (i think ADEX uses 100% to calculate the expected txfee) ... and it was only 0.20$

Thanks cipi


[13-Oct-21 11:24 AM] cipi#4502
@Slyris @syl could it be that ADEX Desktop multiplies the value it gets from mm2 with 2 before showing the expected fee to the user? it shows $0.92 for a USDT to KMD swap, 4x higher then actual because TakerPayment is only 0.20$... half of the error is because of the 150000 gas limit, but i guess the other half could be because Desktop still multiplies the value with 2


[13-Oct-21 11:38 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
I'm nearly sure that some time ago ( month or 2) the BNB swap fees were significantly lower than now.


[13-Oct-21 12:06 PM] cipi#4502
btw, you will only pay what the chain is "demanding" at the moment of the swap, regardless of what the GUI is showing as expected fees


[13-Oct-21 12:50 PM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
Didn't know that, and what about the maker fees? Does maker pay only simple transaction fee?


[13-Oct-21 01:00 PM] cipi#4502
yes, maker pays only the txfees for the involved chains

I don't know the details, but that's quite convenient to find interesting offer for a given coin, by using it in a batch you maybe able to find some cross-routing juicing swaps

the issues says it, it's hard, so i don't think it will be supported any time soon
but i wouldn't use it anyway because of the extreme fees on ETH chain... you will pay 50$ txfees for every swap... so i recommend to use other chains, like USDT-BEP20

I want to file a feature request  regarding AtomicDEX not showing detailed info about current progress, it's missing the confirmation waited.  It just showed "Maker Payment Validated and confirmed"  and just a timer under it.  

I want to see number of current confirmations and  a link to the explorer where the transaction is happening

in logs it shows the following.
```

Hi @Duke of Sands 1 Right click on asset you want to remove and you'll see disabling functionality menu


[22-Oct-21 08:48 AM] TonyL#3577
note that it's not possible to disable startup "default" coins: KMD, BTC, LTC


[22-Oct-21 09:26 AM] Jimm B.#9993
@TonyL does it have to be like that?  why not give everyone the freedom to choose what they want?


[22-Oct-21 09:28 AM] Jimm B.#9993
if someone uses AtomicDEX only to hold KMD and does not want to see the other coins, he should be able to hide the others.


[22-Oct-21 09:29 AM] Jimm B.#9993
in my opinion.


[22-Oct-21 09:32 AM] cipi#4502
the danger of 51% attacks on ETH chain are is very low because of the hashrate and thus the costs
and BSC and the others are more centralized, not freely mineable by everyone, so danger is low there too


[22-Oct-21 09:33 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
While that may hold true for some, it's kinda counter to marketing basics to allow the turn off of KMD


[22-Oct-21 09:40 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
Maybe because that doesn't make any sense. What is the real difference between having one coin enabled (KMD) or 3 of them?


[22-Oct-21 09:40 AM] Jimm B.#9993
@ComputerGenie KMD also benefits from people using AtomicDEX.  I often remember reading that it was positively emphasized that you don't need a KMD to use AtomicDEX.  so you should have the freedom to deactivate KMD as well.  if I remember correctly, incentives / advantages should be created when using KMD.  From my point of view it is ok to display default coins, but if you want, you should be able to deactivate what you want.


[22-Oct-21 09:41 AM] Jimm B.#9993
@Jupiter&Mars it's a small thing but I understand ... if you don't want to see something, then you don't want to see it ...

[22-Oct-21 09:46 AM] Jimm B.#9993
@Slyris why not just give the users what they want?  I understand what you're saying but would it really be that hard to give people the freedom to hide unwanted coins?  btw I don't really care, but I understand users who want that. default coins is ok but to be forced to always see them ...

There is toggle of balance evaluation ($, KMD, LTC, BTC) + we do have to show something by default on the DEX view for new users. All coins disabling adding danger of crashes in many places and etc. 
` btw I don't really care, but I understand users who want that` If there will be many requests from users who strictly don't want to see LTC/BTC enabled we'll consider possibility of this logic changing and all coins disabling feature (personally, I don't see much sense in it).  So far I've seen 0 such feature requests.

[23-Oct-21 05:43 AM] uak#6718
maybe those block requirements should be in place when someone is trading large amount. I mean set those protection if the value traded is higher than the cost to attack network.


[23-Oct-21 05:44 AM] uak#6718
also maybe create a fund for those who lose money because of such attack. I think it outweigh the loss of time delay for many trades


[23-Oct-21 05:45 AM] uak#6718
like an insurance to cover any loses if proved to be caused by such attack if trade value is less than $500 maybe while insuring someone doesn't exploit the rewards it self üôÇ

you can configure the number of confirmations needed yourself, on the swap confirmation page


[23-Oct-21 07:19 AM] Regnar#6164
I have an idea I was hoping to bounce around with some people about AtomicDEX, primarily with KMD rewards. There could be a cool opportunity for us to add something that would encourage people to avoid letting their rewards expire. Basically if we had a way to track "streaks" in the AtomicDEX that tracks the number of times (or months, since it's more profitable for people to claim monthly) you claimed your rewards without letting it expire. So for example if you claim monthly your score would grow, but if you fail to claim one month it would reset.


[23-Oct-21 07:26 AM] Regnar#6164
It could give people more reason to open the app (and potentially trade more frequently)


[23-Oct-21 07:29 AM] Regnar#6164
Obviously there's economic incentive for people to claim on time, but sometimes the non-monetary things help us do things better than the simply monetary. If the streaks are built properly they would actually be aligned with the most profitable method of claiming. It doesn't have to be a streak number, but could be something that grows or changes the longer you have a streak. some examples: emojis moving up to fire and money bags, 12 types of lizards from little gecko all the way up to king komodo with a crown (for a year of claims).


[23-Oct-21 07:30 AM] Regnar#6164
Any thoughts on this idea?


[23-Oct-21 08:04 AM] smkhound#7640
GUI gamification sounds like a nice idea. Even something like weekly swap count with some sort of tier badge

{Reactions}
üëç 

[23-Oct-21 09:09 AM] Regnar#6164
All comes down to what do we want to encourage users to do. Claiming monthly seems like a good one. It gets people opening the app more often which could get them trading more and also keeps it in sight/mind. Weekly swap counts are another great one, it gets people swapping frequently. I'm also partial to longer term rewards that promote consistency. Swap counts over a period of time, and maintaining that streak.


[23-Oct-21 11:18 AM] uak#6718
but not based on amount traded, right?


[23-Oct-21 11:20 AM] uak#6718
maybe something like "you are setting a trade for amount larger than $1000 for a coin that could be reorged for $900, We suggest increasing the confirmation required to 2 confirmations"


[23-Oct-21 11:21 AM] uak#6718
otherwise it doesn't make sense to have everyone restricted for a possibility that rarely happen?


[23-Oct-21 11:22 AM] uak#6718
Last time I traded $5 KMD it took almost half an hour for confirmations


[23-Oct-21 11:23 AM] jspook16#3059
Maybe a configuration that the user can set up as they please....with ranges....$0-$100 - 0 confirmations, $101-499 2 confirmation <$1000 3 confirmations


[23-Oct-21 11:25 AM] uak#6718
that would be cool, but next step is to make it a default policy to have ranges based on actual data


[23-Oct-21 11:26 AM] jspook16#3059
well i was thinking the user would define their ranges....user A being cautious may want anything over $100 to have 5 confirmations.....user B being more frivolous may want everything from 0 - 10,000 to be 0 confirmations


[23-Oct-21 11:28 AM] cipi#4502
before the swap starts, so you decide what a high amount is for yourself


[23-Oct-21 11:29 AM] cipi#4502
problem is that this info is not available to fetch somewhere, you need to calculate that based on hashrate of that chain and price of the coin


[23-Oct-21 11:30 AM] cipi#4502
simply disable notarizations and set the number of confirmations to something like 3-4 for incoming KMD txes

sure, but you need to collect this data and provide in a way ADEX can use it, an API

There are protocols on API integration roadmap from cmc top page where you not have to pay 50$+ for swap. As current ERC20 swapping statistics shows (swaps amount) it's not reasonable to allocate couple month for single ERC20 integration even it's biggest marketcap one


[25-Oct-21 01:06 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
> or force USDT folks to deploy standard ERC20 smartcontract
this hurts my brain too much
since when did AtomicDEX become like every CEX on the planet ("make it fit our template we already use or we're not listing it!")?
> it's not reasonable to allocate couple month for single ERC20 integration even it's biggest marketcap one
This iteration has taken how many *years* now? To reach *beta*? And that's "too much"? Really?

Its reminds me on arr and integration...arrr grow out of kmd community so its very close to kmd but team doesnt make it to integrate it to adex....there was so much volume and attention to arrr after big pump...it was the chance for kmd and adex to get big attention too...but now attention is gone away and volume is very low....its sad that others and not kmd itself benefit from his son/daughter


[25-Oct-21 11:05 PM] Slyris#2880
This is sad to read, because actually @artem.pikulin did a great job for the integration.

And that have been announced by the team that `ARRR` swaps will be available at the end of the year.

Yeah i know arr integration will come but its 1 year to late....like i said. We missed the daily volumes of 60.000.0000 and the attention....thats all


By the way...integration of arrr until end of year is still a very good  process

Honestly the fees should not matter. If somebody wants to pay 1/777 and 50$ in gas fee for a 2bn trade of Bitcoin to USDT OTC instead of 50$ in fee to deposit it to a CEX and have the risk of the money consficated than let him do that. 
If somebody wants to buy 1KMD for 2 USDT and pay 50$ in fee yes that's silly but his choice.
If I want to sell 1EMC2 for 1000USDT and somebody agrees to the trade it's a good deal for me me no mind paying 50 USDT fee.
As for the technical issues which seems to be the bigger issue: as CG said it's a pretty big big big market. So maybe a workaround in mm2 can be done to follow a different path for USDT-erc20 the contract can be changed in the initialization of the coin if i recall correctly.
Also: mostly all platform I have seen do not support USDT-BEP20 they all want ERC20 probably because they do not want to relay on Binance giving you the 'real' erc20 -> 'real' USD.
smartfi celsius for example all want erc20

Fully understand but how long arr and dex existing? Honest answer please


[26-Oct-21 12:36 AM] cryptosammy#3587
I do not know how long they exist and I just recently got into Komodo tech. I do however looked at the code and even while I don't understand 99%, AtomicDEX is elegant for users, but the codebase at the deep level is something you can only have admiration for. The mm2 / AtomicDEX api works out of the box. In regard to ARRR, which I only know very little about, is a coin that needs more than just a "slap this" and it works. I have learned the last weeks that research and innovation takes 99% of the time. Perhaps it could've been here a year ago, but there are often features that have a higher priority than others. To do this kind of work, it comes from an inner drive. I don't know who works on this part or who doesn't, what I do know when you code something, there is this urge for completing a feature. How frustrating it might be for you - keep in mind to remain positive and support, no cheer for the people who work hard to make awesome tech that benefits everyone. And maybe a year to late (taking your words), but better later with a good feature than a half assed piece of code that needs to go back to the drawing table (excuse my french)

Adex existing since 2016/2017 and pirates since 2018....so there was no time to integrate pirate into adex? I am not a def but i think it should be possible... what happened is following....arr get hyped and kmd team recognize that integration is needed but its not possible in 2 weeks...that i understand...now arr will integrated by end of year what is amazing but its to late to use the chance of get big attention....


[26-Oct-21 12:38 AM] cryptosammy#3587
@find_your_way ah, I get your point


[26-Oct-21 12:44 AM] find_your_way#5266
My point is following...kmd produces great projects like arr but dont use it efficient. Arrr grow very fast with much volume  in short time...daily volume was near 60.000.000 and kmd doesnt benefit from it....this was the biggest chance ever to 1. Become very very big attention from all sides because 2. Daily volume of an private coin on  an unknown dex like adex is a very big news

Let me try to explain this for you, and I might be completely wrong - so just an opinion. I don't believe that the Komodo team and their ecosystem contributors are doing the "hype hype THIS FEATURE lambo lambo moon moon" thing. They make amazing software and most of those amazing features are there for you to work with, develop on - hence the name platform. They make code. They ship. And in this world of crypto, where everyone is hyping and delivering poop, the Komodo team builds awesome things. I believe they want to cater their community, but I also believe that they do what they can do no matter what the current trend is. I have never in my life been so inspired by people, the tech they build and how they share their knowledge, how I have personally grown in coding, understanding security, thinking about testing. If you think a certain feature will make coins skyrocket, you might be right. And missing one momentum is maybe something to say "too bad that wasnt there" - however I think that there is a timing for everything. Just my two eurocents.

I wouldnt say late. Things take time as KMD hasnt got thousands of devs and almost unlimited funding like other platforms do. There will be another arrr pump in the future and by then ARRR is on ADEX. And besides trading on ADEX is a bit different than your usual CEX.

One other thing to keep in mind is that even if ARRR was already on Adex when they had their run,  most of the people that were in that community didn't know a thing about Adex. I think it's on us, the community to market Adex if we are looking for change

you need to regularly compact the database of the electrumx server, else some value will overflow and it crashes
depends on the block time how often... i do it weekly

`0 21 * * 2 sudo systemctl stop electrumx_KMD && COIN=Komodo DB_DIRECTORY=/electrumdb/KMD electrumx_compact_history && sudo systemctl start electrumx_KMD`
but depends on how you installed electrumx if that fits for you too

[01-Nov-21 05:41 AM] hellsteeth#7225
Thanks, i used komodo to buy some more tokel,  my balance shows it worked but the atomic dex keeps bouncing messages back n forth (over 50 so far) and amount of both komodo and tokel keeps changin?  Ive checked explorer and all appears ok.   Can i shut down dex n fire it back up or will i lose funds.

Apologies as im fairly new to dex so not sure best way to explain.

Is there an answer on this? I want to send a buy/sell order to AtomicDex via software!


[01-Nov-21 06:45 AM] cipi#4502
there will be a ADEX running in browser, but i guess that is not what you really want
you want an API: https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.html
you can use the calls to talk to the running mm2 instance on your Desktop, but actually it is meant to be run on a VPS on CLI

AtomicDEX API
The AtomicDEX API now offers the num-rational crate feature. This is used to represent order volumes and prices.

Thanks for the answer,

What is the global ip address given in the examples as a local ip address?
How do I test with CMD locally in Windows on my own computer, it's not fully understood where to do the test!


[01-Nov-21 07:19 AM] cipi#4502
there is no global IP, you need to talk to the mm2 running on your PC/VPS, so 127.0.0.1, like: `curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"my_balance\",\"coin\":\"KMD\"}"` to see the balance of KMD


[01-Nov-21 07:23 AM] cipi#4502
what is your intention? do you want to develop a trading bot?


[01-Nov-21 08:01 AM] Ugur#2795
It may be to develop a trading bot, but my main goal is to develop a system that analyzes the market and places orders accordingly.

I can access http://127.0.0.1:7783/ from the commands you sent, but I couldn't understand the code you wrote next, Which username and password should I type, I have more than one profile when entering AtomicDex and they all have different username and password!


[01-Nov-21 08:12 AM] Ugur#2795
@cipi  Can you give an example of how you write the following code to Bowser?
http://127.0.0.1:7783/{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"my_balance\",\"coin\":\"KMD\"}"

Like below?
http://127.0.0.1:7783/userpass/my_balance/coin/KMD


[01-Nov-21 08:14 AM] cipi#4502
you can only interact with one address/seed phrase at a time, it is used to launch mm2
the thing you need is userpass, which is normally also set on startup, but ADEX Desktop generates a random password on each start... you can view it in Desktop under Settings - View Seed Phrase or so
no, you can't pass the params in URL, need to be in body, like above


[01-Nov-21 08:19 AM] Ugur#2795
I got the RPC password, but the working example is below;

http://127.0.0.1:7783/{\"userpass\":\"RPCPass\",\"method\":\"my_balance\",\"coin\":\"KMD\"}"


[01-Nov-21 08:19 AM] Ugur#2795
When I write from here, the code block is broken, how should we do it?


[01-Nov-21 08:31 AM] cipi#4502
you can't pass the arguments in URL, it's not a GET request, it's a POST request

not open source. not much benefit in making a website open source and only many disadvantages.

Hi,
I started a KMD/MCL swap through AtomicDex, then I got some TKL with TKL/MCL, then the KMD/MCL swap remained incorrectly and cannot be cancelled.


[03-Nov-21 10:10 PM] cipi#4502
somebody with KMD address `RCBheTft7W19VQ28wXpY5EdwnaA8zfpbCV` and pubkey `02f70d90df545d767a53daa25e07875b4b588c476cba465a28dcafc4b6b792cf94` posted a lot of unfillable orders in different orderbook, like this one
```
      "maxvolume": "13566.09376911238716990689",
      "min_volume": "13566.09376911238716990689",
```
nobody can match such orders out of couple of reasons... one is that the coin has 8 decimals, so there is no way to buy 13566.09376911238716990689
whoever that is, please update your ADEX, cancel all those orders and create new, valid ones


[03-Nov-21 10:58 PM] cryptosammy#3587
@cipi is this a bug that this is possible? Also do orders have a lifetime in adex?


[03-Nov-21 10:59 PM] Ugur#2795
Thanks for the answer.

The order cannot be canceled and atomicdex is already up to date.


[03-Nov-21 11:04 PM] cipi#4502
not sure, i was just told that it's not a bug
the problem is that min_volume is set to same value as max_volume... ADEX Desktop changed the way those volume sliders work so it does not happen that easy any more... but all existing orders remain valid, after update too
so we need to get rid of those somehow


[03-Nov-21 11:04 PM] cipi#4502
they don't have a lifetime... as long as the pubkey exists and the node is online, those orders will remain


[03-Nov-21 11:05 PM] cryptosammy#3587
at least you found the owner


[03-Nov-21 11:07 PM] cipi#4502
it's there since a longer time... someone just sent me a link to a discord message of me with the same problem with address/pubkey from a month ago or so


[03-Nov-21 11:07 PM] cryptosammy#3587
oh dear


[03-Nov-21 11:08 PM] cipi#4502
so is that you? what do you mean with "cannot be canceled"?


[03-Nov-21 11:08 PM] cryptosammy#3587
@cipi ``` and the node is online ``` can you find its IP ?


[03-Nov-21 11:09 PM] cryptosammy#3587
i assume not


[03-Nov-21 11:10 PM] cipi#4502
was thinking about the same... but i don't think so... maybe on the seed nodes, but it's not in the logs/console... i guess that's not possible


[03-Nov-21 11:13 PM] cipi#4502
you could simply stop ADEX, remove the directory `~/.atomic_qt/mm2/DB/2a62e1cabacba3760ac65ee712834423a8eadd83/ORDERS/MY/` and restart, then all orders are gone for sure
2a62e1cabacba3760ac65ee712834423a8eadd83 needs to be replaced by the id of the node... just look into the directory, there shouldn't be too many different ones around

Trying to send tokel, how long should i wait after clicking prepare?


[04-Nov-21 06:50 AM] cipi#4502
you need to click send after prepare, no need to wait


[04-Nov-21 07:20 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
How is that possible that he could send invalid orders? Doesn't atomic verify the orders before they can be sent?


[04-Nov-21 07:23 AM] cipi#4502
the order is valid, min_volume is not bigger then max_volume... but they are both the same, so it's hard to match that order
but i can't debug this, since i am not the maker (the one who posted that orders) and i don't have access to the logs or console output of that maker


[04-Nov-21 07:24 AM] cipi#4502
the reason could also be something completely different, idk... the one that runs that maker needs to check his logs so the devs can debug this if it's a bug


[04-Nov-21 07:33 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
And what about the order volume? Is it valid too?
` the coin has 8 decimals, so there is no way to buy 13566.09376911238716990689`
If that's correct then this order shouldn't be considered valid.


[04-Nov-21 07:35 AM] hellsteeth#7225
After clicking prepare loading symbol appears send button didnt show.   Finally got error message and everythimg froze.
Had to shut down.
Back to reloading for another hour, must be somethimg my end wrong but cant work it out.
Taken me 4 hours to send 1 transactiom so farü§î


[04-Nov-21 07:37 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
in and of itself, the order it "logically valid"
the decimal "issue" is specific to the coin(s), not the platform


[04-Nov-21 07:41 AM] cipi#4502
yes, i was told that it's not a problem... the decimals... i was wrong in my assumption that it could be the problem


[04-Nov-21 07:42 AM] cipi#4502
that is weird... is ADEX Desktop or some other app eating up all your CPU and RAM? how is the usage?


[04-Nov-21 07:45 AM] cipi#4502
look in the logs, maybe it tries to fetch some external URLs like crazy and gets an error all the time... eg price service/tx_history7whatever

[04-Nov-21 08:06 AM] cipi#4502
if ADEX throws errors in logs like crazy, eg several times a second, then it should be fixed in the sense that it needs some sleeps between the tries... but idk if that is the case... but if it is, it would drain your CPU because it then tries to fetch as fast as he can

[04-Nov-21 08:48 AM] cipi#4502
have you accumulated lots of small utxos on that address? are you mining to that address?
if the tx you are trying to send needs to be composed of 555 different small utxos, the electrum server might get into trouble collecting the info in time... or maybe it's just the PC that's get "overloaded"
try to send a smaller amount... and consolidate the many utxos by sending to yourself
try to avoid mining to the same address or consolidate the utxos regularly... ADEX API actually has an option for that, i used it on RICK/MORTY servers with lots of utxos: `\"utxo_merge_params\":{\"merge_at\":200,\"check_every\":600,\"max_merge_at_once\":100}` would automatically merge the many utxos... but GUI hasn't added that param


[05-Nov-21 12:25 AM] Ugur#2795
It does not appear in Orders, but it appears on the Trading screen, and when I hover over it and press the X sign, it does not cancel.

[05-Nov-21 03:35 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
I have noticed similar behavior of atomicDex: sometimes it stops displaying orders in orders and history tabs (no orders found) and in that case you cannot even cancel the orders in the orderbook tab.


[05-Nov-21 03:39 AM] cipi#4502
damn, this explains all the non-match able orders in the orderbooks... devs need to take a look at this


[05-Nov-21 03:41 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
In my case the solution to that is just restarting atomic.


[05-Nov-21 03:42 AM] cipi#4502
idk if that really solves the problem, because mm2 unfortunately saves the order infos on disk and recreates them after restart... no matter what the GUI shows


[05-Nov-21 03:44 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
In my case it solves the problem, I mean atomic starts to display the orders and they can be canceled if I want to.


[05-Nov-21 03:45 AM] cipi#4502
what helps for sure to get rid of the orders is to remove directory `~/.atomic_qt/mm2/DB/2a62e1cabacba3760ac65ee712834423a8eadd83/ORDERS/MY/` and restart where `2a62e1cabacba3760ac65ee712834423a8eadd83` is the id of your node


[05-Nov-21 03:46 AM] cipi#4502
i actually do this on every restart, to be sure old shit is gone üòÑ

@Jupiter&Mars @Ugur are you on github? If so, can you please comment to the issue and attach the logs to it? there are always 2 files from a certain time range... one ends in `.log`, the other one ends in `.mm2.log`
both would be nice, but i guess the last one is enough (i mean the last pair)
you can also send me those in DM


[05-Nov-21 04:54 AM] smkhound#7640
just curious - are either of you guys running the same seed on two devices?


[05-Nov-21 05:07 AM] Slyris#2880
It's exactly what I thought


[05-Nov-21 05:07 AM] Slyris#2880
I think someone his using the same seed and that's why he cannot cancel his orders, not created on the same device


[05-Nov-21 05:08 AM] Slyris#2880
And that's also why it doesn't appear in the tabs


[05-Nov-21 05:08 AM] Slyris#2880
This machine is probably still running with the same seed, orders should be cancelled from there.


[05-Nov-21 05:12 AM] cipi#4502
can this be solved in general? like the seed nodes accepting only the first connection from a node with a certain seed... and if a second one with same seed appears, drop connection


[05-Nov-21 05:13 AM] cipi#4502
or maybe better the other way around... drop connection of old node and accept new node


[05-Nov-21 05:14 AM] Milerius#3376
Just for infos in the code it's ` let is_mine = my_pubsecp == ask.pubkey;`


[05-Nov-21 05:14 AM] Milerius#3376
But in general, desktop may add a double check to not add the `x` cross if it's not present in my_orders models.


[05-Nov-21 05:19 AM] hellsteeth#7225

Do you use a VPN at all? or lots of torrent / uploads etc active? Erratic connectivity can sometimes throw a spanner in the works


[05-Nov-21 05:40 AM] smkhound#7640
I'm also here to assist with trying to replicate this


[05-Nov-21 05:44 AM] Slyris#2880
I replied on GitHub, I know this problem, is not a desktop bug, it's just undefined behavior to use the seed at the same time from multiple device.


[05-Nov-21 05:56 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
I don't use 1 seed on 2 devices, what I'm using is atomicDex instance + bash script using API set on linux VM


[05-Nov-21 05:59 AM] smkhound#7640
so same seed on VM and gui?


[05-Nov-21 06:01 AM] smkhound#7640
Pinned a message.


[05-Nov-21 06:02 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
LInux host -> linux guest VM -> atomicDex instance (MM2) + bash script sending API requests.


[05-Nov-21 06:03 AM] smkhound#7640
and the orders dont display in console?

They display and sometimes it goes smooth for 24h or so, but sometimes Atomic stops displaying orders.


[05-Nov-21 06:05 AM] smkhound#7640
I'm just a bit confused, cos you mention history and orders tab here


[05-Nov-21 06:07 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
I meant orders and history tabs In Trading information section.


[05-Nov-21 06:07 AM] smkhound#7640
of gui?


[05-Nov-21 06:08 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
atomicDex GUI


[05-Nov-21 06:10 AM] smkhound#7640
cos gui runs it's own mm2, and has DB folder in ` ~/.atomic_qt/mm2` 
if you have a secondary DB folder elsewhere, like in the VM, and it's using the same seed as the gui, could cause some exotic outcomes.


[05-Nov-21 06:11 AM] smkhound#7640
I'm not sure if having two mm2 instances (eg gui/vm) running pointed at the same DB would be good either


[05-Nov-21 06:15 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
My script uses default DB in ~/.atomic_qt/mm2.


[05-Nov-21 06:16 AM] cipi#4502
does the script "talk" to the same mm2 instance that is started by the GUI, or is it a second mm2 instance pointing to the same DB directory?


[05-Nov-21 06:16 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
same mm2 instance that is started by the GUI


[05-Nov-21 06:18 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
I'm only using the gui to watch the market and swaps. All orders are being sent or cancelled by the script.

[05-Nov-21 05:54 PM] Regnar#6164
Honestly, I wouldn't be opposed to having a way to use KMD to buy themes directly from Komodo within the DEX. Obviously people could always do what I did and just swap out some colors from a free palette online, but the convenience of browsing premades might be worth it to people


[05-Nov-21 05:54 PM] jspook16#3059
Yeah I would agree.


[05-Nov-21 05:54 PM] Regnar#6164
don't want to canibalize the branded dex market, but honestly, I don't think it would since the branded DEX would probably have more unique, non-theme based stuff

[05-Nov-21 05:57 PM] Regnar#6164
Also the whole building your own requires you to not have a single file version (AppImage, exe or w.e.) so it probably would be convenient to browse some and pick ones you like

https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins has all the infos about the supported coins
so first, you need to find out the params, do a test swap and then add the coin to that repo
after that a PR to https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop is needed to add the coins to the GUI


[10-Nov-21 04:03 AM] Regnar#6164
Yea I think this analogy actually is working for this. I was talking with crabby in #üí¨‚îÉgeneral about it. 

Right now swapping tokens is like buying a car from someone on the internet, but they drive the car to a parking lot and park it there with enough gas to take it home but not for you to drive back to your house. You pay them money, they give you the keys and they go hop on a bus and leave. 
You now own the car sitting in a lot with basically no gas in it. You would have needed to bring your own gallon of gas to take it home (but then we wouldn't be having this discussion) or alternatively, the seller could have left it with more gas so you could make it home.

Not sure if a seller could include BNB/ETH with the swap, and lock that with the same hash to finish the swap.


[10-Nov-21 04:51 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
imo, the only real problem with the analogy, in full, is that it also requires that the gas/car that you need to buy the gas/car you want must be purchased from a different dealership (platform), thus rendering the car you want from the place you want less attractive.
dropping the analogy: what's the draw to adex if you have to go elsewhere to buy stuff in order to use adex?

If you have never used AtomicDEX before, you should just create a new wallet. It will give you your private keys during the process that you should keep safely for yourself and use in case you need to set up this wallet again in the future or on another device

routing reserves. You get a cut of the tx fee if your bid/ask allotment is used to enable the swap for another trade that uses your funds to enable a bridge swap.

ltc-kmd-doge I have the a kmd/ltc pair on the orderbook and another user has a doge/kmd pair. whoever wants to swap ltc for doge can settle the trade by bridging the two separate books via kmd.

Pretty sure that role is meant for LP's/ arbitrage bots


[11-Nov-21 06:54 AM] Regnar#6164
@Komodefi 
So my take on the KMD as a router (an idea I like)
```How it is now: someone places an order on a sparse orderbook, a third party browsing the orderbooks can look for opportunities to accomplish that trade by routing through another pair (not just KMD) assuming there is a profit margin available for them between the two pairs. 

Pros: 
1) I don't think this requires any changes to AtomicDEX API or the GUI as routing is done by a third party likely using the API. 
2) Routers are incentivized by profits from the spread.
3) Routers can focus on specific routes, or focus on a single REL (like KMD)
4) Routers might converge on KMD as ideal candidate because cheaper tx fees, fast tx times, and lower DEX fees already

Cons: 
1) Considering this can be done already, it doesn't appear to be getting done for w.e. reason. 
2) Requires custom code to browse orderbooks for routing, while not a con in itself, it's a barrier to entry for routers. 
3) Ignores trades that could be done on par value or below the desired profit margin, i.e. missed volume.
4) Empty orderbooks often discourage average traders from becoming makers. Probably even more prevalent for Mobile users who are primarily takers, so there isn't anything to Route
```


[11-Nov-21 07:03 AM] Regnar#6164
```Building Routers in AtomicDEX: someone looks at a sparse orderbook for a trade they want to make, or they select the simple swap feature on AtomicDEX and select pairs. If there isn't really trades for the pair, the user can enable "Routing" and AtomicDEX client can search for routes to accomplish the trade.

Pros: 
1) Routers can focus on routing through KMD pairs, this increases KMD utility in the DEX 
2) KMD being the main Routing pair for clients, means Maker Liquidity tools become easier to manage, ie. All coins you provide liquidity for you just pair them against KMD.
3) Users are more likely to be able to trade on sparse orderbooks, so long as there's a route
4) cheaper for user since there isn't a profit margin from the router
5) KMD is a pretty quick coin with low tx fees which positions it nicely for routing
6) KMD already has lower DEX fees which means it's a cheaper routing option as well
7) On par trades, or even at a slight loss, could be acceptable by trader and executed. i.e. more volume.
8) Routes can be done faster if a user has enough KMD on standby, they execute two trades simulataneously, one to buy the desired coin with KMD, the other to sell the coin they have to replenish the KMD they just spent

Cons: 
1) Might require changes to AtomicDEX API, but could be done with current API calls (orderbook, buy, sells etc)
2) Definitely requires some changes to the AtomicDEX GUI to support optional routing
3) Second swap could fail which would leave the user holding KMD when they never intended to buy KMD (might be able sell back, but not ideal either way)
4) For those in less Tax friendly areas, this is probably treated as multiple trades.
```


[11-Nov-21 07:13 AM] Regnar#6164
Number 8 on there actually is interesting as it's not really routing (DOGE->KMD->LTC) but more parallel trading (DOGE->KMD and KMD->LTC). So it requires having enough KMD on hand to do a trade, but I think it would be easier to add to AtomicDEX since it's just two normal buy orders. It still has benefits like giving KMD hodlers more utility/value, and still makes KMD pairs popular for LPs.

[11-Nov-21 07:15 AM] Regnar#6164
Probably just offset the timing of the trades too, DOGE->KMD and when maker sends payment you start KMD->LTC, when LTC maker sends payment you send the DOGE and then the KMD. This way you are more confident both trades will complete

We are already aware of the difficulties of such approach, an issue is already open and it's not the priority ATM.

<https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/808>


[13-Nov-21 08:34 AM] Regnar#6164
That's a bit different. This is just two regular buy orders. It just involves checking the orderbook for the base and rel vs KMD as well


[13-Nov-21 08:34 AM] Regnar#6164
but I understand


[13-Nov-21 08:34 AM] Slyris#2880
The big problem if the number of failure point, if one of the swap failed, the problem is the chain-ing refunding part


[13-Nov-21 08:34 AM] Slyris#2880
There is too much security problem of such swap atm


[13-Nov-21 08:34 AM] Slyris#2880
Once we will have instant swap this will be a bit different probably


[13-Nov-21 08:35 AM] Slyris#2880
Such approach make sense with ETH-fork family for example, with UTXO this is much more difficult


[13-Nov-21 08:35 AM] Regnar#6164
Right, but this isn't exactly like those two mentioned in the requests.


[13-Nov-21 08:35 AM] Slyris#2880
What happen if the first swap fail?


[13-Nov-21 08:36 AM] Regnar#6164
I'd be more concerned about the second swap failing.


[13-Nov-21 08:36 AM] Slyris#2880
also


[13-Nov-21 08:36 AM] Slyris#2880
The problem is the mechanism of locking all those order properly and have a proper refund mechanism


[13-Nov-21 08:37 AM] Slyris#2880
but yeah indeed in the idea it's how it could work


[13-Nov-21 08:37 AM] Slyris#2880
However, showing the routing possibility will already be something great for trading bot etc


[13-Nov-21 08:37 AM] Regnar#6164
yea, if a normal swap has too high of a failure rate, it defeats the purpose of doing two swaps


[13-Nov-21 08:38 AM] Slyris#2880
The thing also if you swap A<->B<->C and the full swap take lot of time involving coin with lot of blocktime, the swap can be less interesting once it's finished.


[13-Nov-21 08:38 AM] Slyris#2880
That's why starting such approach of swaps with eth fork family would make more sense, you can have your full swap in few seconds.


[13-Nov-21 08:38 AM] Regnar#6164
I originally made a bot to trade these for arbitrage but would have failing second swaps, or the second order not matching for w.e. reason, leaving me holding a coin I didn't actually want


[13-Nov-21 08:39 AM] Slyris#2880
It's exactly the problem that we need to solve for such implementation


[13-Nov-21 08:39 AM] Regnar#6164
right, but this is more A-B, B-C


[13-Nov-21 08:39 AM] Regnar#6164
not linking the two really in any way


[13-Nov-21 08:40 AM] Slyris#2880
yeah that's the whole pb


[13-Nov-21 08:40 AM] Slyris#2880
it need to be linked all together into the same "contract"


[13-Nov-21 08:40 AM] Slyris#2880
if you want proper fallback when a swap fail


[13-Nov-21 08:40 AM] Regnar#6164
Look at orderbook for DASH to DOGE, it's empty. Look at orderbook for DASH to KMD and the orderbook for KMD to DOGE.


[13-Nov-21 08:40 AM] Slyris#2880
it cannot be A<->B then B<->C without linking both HTLC together


[13-Nov-21 08:41 AM] Slyris#2880
But I'm aware of that, but you already explain the biggest problem `leaving me holding a coin I didn't actually want`


[13-Nov-21 08:41 AM] Regnar#6164
That coin being KMD


[13-Nov-21 08:41 AM] Slyris#2880
great but in your example the guy want to swap DASH to DOGE, not being alone with KMD


[13-Nov-21 08:42 AM] Regnar#6164
but yea, I get it. I just don't think this would need to be linked really.


[13-Nov-21 08:42 AM] Regnar#6164
I get what you're saying though.


[13-Nov-21 08:42 AM] Slyris#2880
It need to be linked for few reason:

- Refund mechanism
- Lock all the swap for this specific pubkey, don't let other users swallow this order meanwhile the other swaps are running


[13-Nov-21 08:43 AM] Slyris#2880
Imagine if during the first swap someone swallow the other order


[13-Nov-21 08:43 AM] Slyris#2880
you get the same problem.


[13-Nov-21 08:43 AM] Regnar#6164
I was thinking if they aren't linked, it gives you opportunity to try multiple makers on the final swap (with price slippage)


[13-Nov-21 08:44 AM] Slyris#2880
If you want such swap to work nicely:

- Make swap instant
- Lock them together
- Have proper refund mechanism
- American call options <https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/823>


[13-Nov-21 08:45 AM] Regnar#6164
Yea I guess the difference here is I'm looking at a way to use the same APIs available to line up two separate swaps that can accomplish the desired result. There is risk of a swap failing or getting eaten up. Without developing a different way to approach swaps, it is unavoidable

> to line up two separate swaps that can accomplish the desired result

Yeah you want the routing API to do it manually

if I understand


[13-Nov-21 08:49 AM] Slyris#2880

There's already ideas proposed in that github issue that would attempt to do what you're suggesting (linking them) this is not that and won't accomplish the same things with the same error handling, nor is it attempting to do that


[13-Nov-21 08:50 AM] Regnar#6164
one button could issue the different API calls to show a potential route.


[13-Nov-21 08:50 AM] Slyris#2880
the problem now is the algorithm time of such approach


[13-Nov-21 08:50 AM] Regnar#6164
But if that feels like a middle ground solution and not worthy of addition, that's fine too


[13-Nov-21 08:50 AM] Slyris#2880
you have to imagine that there is ATM ~500 coins

I think there is million of pairs possibility


[13-Nov-21 08:51 AM] Slyris#2880
and routing


[13-Nov-21 08:51 AM] Regnar#6164
That's why I'm *only* searching through KMD


[13-Nov-21 08:51 AM] Slyris#2880
oh this way it's very easy you know


[13-Nov-21 08:51 AM] Slyris#2880
you can already do it with the API


[13-Nov-21 08:52 AM] Slyris#2880
Wait I will even add it right now in my CLI client if you want


[13-Nov-21 08:52 AM] Regnar#6164
yes. Its also for the reasons I outlined here <https://discord.com/channels/412898016371015680/705374203972419616/908373969277714482>


[13-Nov-21 08:52 AM] Regnar#6164
that's what I have said


[13-Nov-21 08:52 AM] Slyris#2880
It's super trivial.


[13-Nov-21 08:53 AM] Regnar#6164
```
You use 1.0 DASH to buy 219.2741639251549 KMD at 0.0045605008 per DASH.
You then use 219.2741639251549 KMD to buy 876.2068272633568 DOGE at 0.25025388652815056 KMD per DOGE

End result: 1.0 DASH for 876.2068272633568 DOGE
Or you could have bought: 0.0 DOGE directly with DASH
```


[13-Nov-21 08:54 AM] Slyris#2880
- Call best order with your alt coin you want to sell  (here DASH)

- Iterate through the result

- If needle_coin is present (KMD) call best_orders with the volume of this KMD entry and say that coin you would like to buy is (DOGE)

- If there is any result, return the aggregation of both entries


[13-Nov-21 08:54 AM] Slyris#2880
https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/atomicdex-api-legacy/best_orders.html


[13-Nov-21 08:55 AM] Slyris#2880
and on top of that it's will always show the best routing using best orders


[13-Nov-21 08:56 AM] Slyris#2880
If you want a faster result you can use buy instead of sell so it's will only return what you want.


[13-Nov-21 08:56 AM] Regnar#6164
This is why I feel there was a disconnect in what we were talking about, what you are describing is what I am doing.


[13-Nov-21 08:57 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah but you just need to be aware that there is no guarantee you will go through all swaps and price will stay the same


[13-Nov-21 08:57 AM] Slyris#2880
that's what I mean


[13-Nov-21 08:57 AM] Slyris#2880
so this infos is highly instable/can be dangerous


[13-Nov-21 08:57 AM] Regnar#6164
but your other point still stands, it is two separate swaps, and if the second fails then you are stuck with KMD until you can effectively sell it for the end coin you wanted


[13-Nov-21 08:58 AM] Slyris#2880
maker update orders between 30sec and every 2 mins, so for UTXO swaps you can be absolutely sure that you will never be able to complete the swap with the initial wishing


[13-Nov-21 08:58 AM] Regnar#6164
Right, that's why I was saying this is more of a "make it happen at best price" not "I want this price exactly"


[13-Nov-21 08:58 AM] Slyris#2880
ok my bad then sorry


[13-Nov-21 08:59 AM] Slyris#2880
also there is a better variant of your approach using sell approach instead of buy with a list of needle instead of just only KMD


[13-Nov-21 08:59 AM] Slyris#2880
for example:

- I have DASH and want to have DOGE, i'm willing to accept the best offers that route through [LTC,KMD,FIRO]


[13-Nov-21 09:00 AM] Slyris#2880
then it's a bit more advanced and powerfull i guess


[13-Nov-21 09:01 AM] Slyris#2880
I will add that to my CLI client for fun tomorrow


[13-Nov-21 09:03 AM] Regnar#6164
Is that in the API docs?


[13-Nov-21 09:10 AM] Regnar#6164
So this was an idea to get illiquid pairs to actually trade. My thinking is the first person you trade with (DASH to KMD) doesn't really care that you're trying to immediately use those coins to buy another coin (KMD to DOGE) and if it were me selling KMD for DASH I wouldn't want to have my trade relying on the completion of some other person trying to sell DOGE for KMD. Which is why I was saying this makes plenty of sense, the risk of failed swaps only falls on the person attempting to "link" them together. ie. Two separate swaps initiated by someone trying to achieve the end results of swapping an illiquid pair.

The added benefit was that this could be done with the regular API calls, and assuming the initator understands there could be slippage in the expected prices, that's a pretty good tradeoff vs not being able to do the trade at all, or having to manually enter two separate trades.


[13-Nov-21 09:16 AM] Regnar#6164
There are proposed ways to "link" transactions to have a cascading refund mechanism so the entire process (DASH->KMD->DOGE) becomes atomic. This is not that, it's just parallel trading <https://discord.com/channels/412898016371015680/705374203972419616/908373969277714482> with a single GUI button. Risks included


[13-Nov-21 09:46 AM] Regnar#6164
I personally don't like the chaining transactions idea, if I understand this properly. (DASH->KMD->DOGE) This is actually three parties: Alice the initiator, who wants to sell DASH for DOGE; Bob the KMD seller who just wants DASH; and Charlie the DOGE seller who just wants KMD. 

Unless all these parties specifically agree to this chaining, I think it creates a situation where Alice who is building the chain of transactions is spreading their risk of failed swaps onto the others, specifically in this case onto Bob by tying Bob's outcome to Charlie's. Bob was attempting to do a single swap and is now weaved into this longer chain and is relying on Charlie accomplishing their swap, when really the Bob shouldn't have any stake in the outcome of the KMD->DOGE side of the swap.

Take this one step further, what if Alice builds a chain that goes DASH->KMD->DOGE->DASH, with the hopes of starting with 1 Dash and ending up with 2. By chaining the results of all the transactions, they would ensure they get a profit or their coins back. And if it doesn't work then all other parties have their trades fail, are out of transaction fees, and wasted time. So two trades that were accomplished perfectly (DASH->KMD and KMD->DOGE) are now fails.

This seems like Alice is trying to profit and spreading her risk of loss onto others by making individual swaps rely on one another, unless I'm understanding this wrong?


[13-Nov-21 09:50 AM] Regnar#6164
Seems like the separate DASH->KMD, KMD->DOGE swaps make a lot more sense as the risk of failing swaps falls solely on the person attempting to accomplish the routing.


[13-Nov-21 10:12 AM] Regnar#6164
just running these test scripts, sometimes routing is more profitable lol. I mean, I expected that to sometimes happen anyway, but still cool to see


[13-Nov-21 10:42 AM] Regnar#6164
For example, if you were to try and sell 100 VRSC right now for RVN. You'd either have to place a maker order and wait for it to fill, or market buy RVN at $0.21 per RVN. Alternatively you could Sell 100 VRSC for KMD and market buy RVN with KMD at $0.13 a coin. 
Buying with VRSC you'd get 463 RVN, using the same amount of VRSC to do VRSC->KMD->RVN you'd get 799 RVN

I think that's a good example of take a pretty liquid orderbook (VRSC/RVN) with little volume because of the price gap, and getting trades out of it. Alternatively, a 3rd party could step in with this knowledge and arbitrage the market. But that would still rely on many regular users being makers, but the KMD routing instead relies on the user being a taker.


[13-Nov-21 10:51 AM] PTYX#6840
it would be interesting if we could figure out a way to pay fees in KMD only


[13-Nov-21 10:52 AM] PTYX#6840
so all transaction fees come out of a KMD balance in the atomicdex and users don't have to worry about having funds in multiple coins.


[13-Nov-21 11:15 AM] Regnar#6164
DEX fees I can see being possible, but transaction fees are transaction fees.


[13-Nov-21 11:16 AM] PTYX#6840
It would be interesting


[13-Nov-21 11:16 AM] PTYX#6840
Like to have an address that paid the fees but it was deducted from the kmd balance


[13-Nov-21 11:16 AM] Regnar#6164
I could see this being a good *optional* idea for users. Pay lower fee and in KMD would make a lot of sense for stuff like BTC and ETH transactions which make the DEX fee payment pretty expensive since its on chain and needs Gas/BTC.


[13-Nov-21 11:17 AM] PTYX#6840
with the current way the dex works i don't even think my idea is possible but it would be interesting. @CHMEX recently made a solution that if you don't have BNB in your balance, you send KMD to a certain address and you get BNB back to pay the transaction fees on swaps


[13-Nov-21 11:18 AM] Regnar#6164
While also allowing users to choose to pay fees in the coins they are trading. This goes back to the original reason, if you want to trade A for B, why would you *need* C

Yea I tried his out. It would definitely have to be pitched correctly though. It rings a bit of the "send 1 ETH get 2 ETH back". So pitching it instead as a swap service like changelly, would resonate better

[14-Nov-21 04:49 AM] Slyris#2880
@shadow.narrow The smart contract of wARRR is non standard, it's not compatible for swap in atomicdex


[14-Nov-21 05:06 AM] Regnar#6164
Yea I did. There's a slight difference between what I wrote there and what I was saying here, that difference is when you use a small bit of KMD as the DEX fee to reserve the second order before you finish the first. That isn't required, but I thought it would be a good way to "reserve" the rate you wanted.

While it's great to see Komodo chaps breaking old conventions, AFAIK the conventional wisdom is that barter don't scale due to the square of products problem. ie volume is spread over n*(n-1)/2 exchange rates, where n is the number of products/coins. Coin "C" allows volumes to be concentrated. Coin C benefits disproportionately. üòâ

if you want to use js, https://discordjs.guide/#before-you-begin teaches all the basics of a discord bot.to add the kmd tip part , you need to create a db on your server, write a program that talks with a local komodo daemon to create new addresses(and store their associated discord ids for deposits etc.,), send transactions etc.,

What is the best protocol to cancel an order that has started a swap? Is there a better way then shutting off the computer/app for 24hrs?


[15-Nov-21 10:09 PM] jspook16#3059
You might be able to send funds from the swapping address to another address that you own. So that you dont have any funds to complete the trade. That might work but I have not tried it.


[15-Nov-21 10:10 PM] jspook16#3059
Unless the swapping locks the funds intended to be traded


[16-Nov-21 01:51 AM] jansako#3330
it does not, you could also send from another address if you happen to be able to open the same addy in another wallet. It is a race against time though.


[16-Nov-21 02:25 AM] Slyris#2880
You should never get to this point, do not start a swap that you are not going to finish, I hope that in the future we will have slashing and fees to pay for people who act in this way.

Especially when eth family protocols are involved, you are actually make maker loose money.

This was a question that a user asked in Tokel discord. A handful of people said the protocol was to shut off computer/app for 24hrs. The OP claimed it was a mistake that was made. But it brings up a point that this is a common problem that people have experienced. In fact thinking about it, it might have happened to me before. The simple fact that adex has to be left on to make trades. It gets often left on for days. And sometimes there are many orders made. Certain scenarios can happen that necessitate canceling an order. 1. Mistake, 2. Market changes in middle of night, you wake up to a bad trade. 3. Maybe dex orders are set, you turn your dex back on/ reconnect internet and it starts a trade you didn't want to make etc.

It shouldn't be possible to cancel a swap. I doesn't matter if the swap is a mistake or not.


[16-Nov-21 04:24 AM] Slyris#2880
(i) Mistake

If it is an error it is the responsibility of the person and in no case the person must cancel the swap.

(ii) Market changes in middle of night, you wake up to a bad trade.

In this case, automatic market making rather than using manual orders.

<https://github.com/Milerius/awesome-atomicdex> Many tools are available here.

(iii) Maybe dex orders are set, you turn your dex back on/ reconnect internet and it starts a trade you didn't want to make etc. 

see (ii), use automatic orders tools that will automatically cancel your orders in case of such events.

btw, is there a way to make atomic swaps not "cancellable" even if they close the app? I mean are there any theoretical changes that could be done to make swaps not cancellable?

how can i cancel an order in the app atomicdex.  order state 1/3 and I closed the program and unloaded it from memory
I was wrong with the order price


There is no cancel button
Only closing adex and wait 1 or 2 days
Do not open

Turn phone off for 24 hours, laughing
Order will timeout.

Turn off electricity for 27 hours

`3. Maybe dex orders are set, you turn your dex back on/ reconnect internet and it starts a trade you didn't want to make`
the orders are maker orders, so they don't start a swap from their own, they are just in orderbook... only if a taker sees the order and fills it, the swap will start... so theoretically you have some time to cancel old orders after you start your ADEX


[16-Nov-21 07:59 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
I would like to point out the old adage, the customer is always right, or in this case the user. aDEX absolutely needs a cancel button. If you have multiple users simply cancelling via turn off app/computer and wait then they have defacto created a cancel button. Personally I'd have no problem paying a small fee to cancel. But not being able to cancel officially and then being told that don't start a trade if you don't intend to finish it, well that invokes some interesting thoughts. If you want use, you need to make the user experience a happy one. Mistakes happen, always have, always will. But let's be honest, in order to cancel an order, turning off app for 24 hrs makes adex feel unprofessional. I'd seriously think about letting a focus group test this user experience and respond back.


[16-Nov-21 08:02 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
Not to mention we keep telling people to get on adex, support it, make trades. But if you make a mistake then at least 24hr down time. We want up time, not down time.

The only moment to cancel is right after the dexfee before sending your deposit. Once you send your timelocked funds it cant be canceled because blockchain...  you would need to reverse the sending of the trx

Guys, turning off your internet, shutting down your computer or pulling out your internet cable won't help and may result in losing refunds as swaps will break and depending on what stage your swap was in. Please refrain from carrying out these actions if you don't want to lose funds.

Best course of action would be to double check before you hit the confirm button. AtomicDEX actually tells you that the actions are irreversible.


[16-Nov-21 10:36 AM] SHossain#0007
Recently, I personally had an issue with a swap. I used fat fingers and didn't double check the price. Closed my AtomicDEX desktop app and left it offline for a while, then, started it back on. The swap continued to complete. There was nothing I could do. But, I was lucky that I knew the maker node owner who manually reversed the transaction for me.


[16-Nov-21 10:37 AM] SHossain#0007
It is best to double or tripple check the price and amount beforehand and hit confirm button to start swap once your are happy.

What CHMEX mentioned is true. And, also maker nodes are not always checking things manually. Mostly everything is auto. If you start swap with an unknown maker node and if the maker node claims your funds, you can't ask for it back.


[16-Nov-21 10:39 AM] SHossain#0007

The swap scenario that people probably want to cancel, is a swap where they swap/buy too expensively.  Maybe a simply solution could be an extra warning.  Like 'You are swapping more than 10 percent from market value'.  I know it already shows the percentage compared to CEX price, but an extra warning confirmation screen might save users some grief.  Caffeine hyped people like myself have also hit the confirm button too quickly.  Simply swap is pretty good as it gets the cheapest order, but I've made a few mistakes on the pro version.  Also, the extra confirmation screen, wont be annoying to experienced users as they would never see the screen, only on the rare occurrence in which they chose the wrong order.

IMO this is really a user experience/ user communication / user expectation issue more than anything. 
- If the user would just be told "deal is done, your coins will be coming in XX time", then the user would not think of the swap as 'in progress' or 'cancellable' (just like a CEX trade).
- If the traded funds would no longer show in the UI then again the user would no longer think of these as 'my coins' but as 'sold coins'. (maybe an entry of 'balance updated' in the UI, most users won't care that the blockchain shows their coins are still there)
They may get mad about a bad trade but won't get mad at the team for not letting them cancel said bad trade.

I understand this would take some fancy UI tomfoolery, but sometimes that is what it takes to manage user expectations. 
Just the age - old dilemma of educating your customers (& raising the bar for adoption at the same time) vs making it look simple on the surface & hiding the 'hard to get stuff' under the hood.

I actually thought of you when I made the suggestion.  I pictured you making a smart arse comment.  Glad my foresight is still good.  I did write, so experienced people don't get annoyed, we could have some logic say that it only display's if order is 10 per cent from CEX, or maybe make it 30 percent.  Experienced user would not make this mistake often.  its just for newbies or the odd mistake that might make someone swap a large amount thousands at  90 percent from value of CEX.

every bit of crypto**currency** revolves around personal responsibility
when you write a large check, you generally look to make sure the amount is what is owed (to avoid over-paying) before handing it over
crypto should be no different
one of the largest purveyor of complaints with crypto software tends to stem from the notion that one should be able to forget that this is all currency

next time, disable dPoW for the incoming KMD (set it to wait for 3-5 confirmations)... not 100% sure, but i guess the locktime will then be lower too
in the end, it all depends on the block time of the traded coins

@cipi I have an enhancement suggestion from TOKEL use. Some early buyers thought they were buying from the IDO address during the IDO period and instead ended up buying from resellers, thus they lost out on the preannounced benefits for IDO participants. It would be awesome to enhance the listings of a known IDO coin since it is being added to aDEX to specifically facilitate the IDO, maybe create a special highlight for listings from the address the IDO creator provides, that way it is VERY clear which listed orders are from the IDO and which are resellers.


[23-Nov-21 06:26 AM] daemonfox#6136
Or a flag, anything to bring attention to the main IDO listed sells so new participants can see up front that they are buying from the project and not other aDEX users in the midst of the IDO.


[23-Nov-21 06:32 AM] cipi#4502
would indeed be nice if ADEX would show some infos for the orders in orderbook, like address/pubkey, min_volume
could be added to this: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/issues/1275

[23-Nov-21 06:42 AM] daemonfox#6136
But I also would push a bit and say, you need to highlight ongoing IDOs in aDEX

What about a slider graphic option on adex to turn geo block off. Comes with an acknowledgement from the user that they understand what they are doing by turning geo block off? Could that be a work around to the legal issues?

Hello awesome community! I tried out the AtomicDex add asset function today for the first time and tried to add a meme coin called baby-floki on the BEP-20. However the program crashes when I get to step of clicking on preview for the coingeko address link. Any idea? My version is v0.5.2-beta on windows

[29-Nov-21 07:22 PM] cipi#4502
it's because of an older version of the file /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6
it does not support GLIBCXX_3.4.26
you can try by doing `strings /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6 | grep GLIBCXX`
i have
```
GLIBCXX_3.4
GLIBCXX_3.4.1
GLIBCXX_3.4.2

you need to ask @Slyris 
but i would be careful with min_volume, since GUI does not show the min_volume of the orders in the orderbook, so takers will try to buy a lower amount, orders will not match and takers will cry üôÇ
so i would use this only on high fee coins like BTC and ERC20

only if your funds are not enough to fill the order, but if your funds are enough, you don't get that warning and can place an order... it is true though that you need to use the volume input field to "accomplish" this, using the slider to lower the volume is blocked if order has min_volume set

Thanks for the answer.

I have already read them in detail. I want to exemplify.


As a result of the MCL/KMD transaction, 10 > KMD has been transferred to my account and it starts giving gifts about 4 hours after this transaction. Why doesn't it start after 1 hour, I'm looking for the answer to this.

depending on how much KMD you have, you might not see it accruing until 4hours if the accrued interest is less than fees to claim.

[04-Dec-21 01:20 PM] Regnar#6164
So if a trading partner (maker or taker) drops out of a swap your AtomicDEX will automatically ignore their orders so you don't do trades with them (this resets though) It's a way of mitigating the issue you just had. The opposite side is without this DEX fee, a taker could spam the network saying they want to make specific trades with literally every maker, get makers to send and lock up coins waiting on you to finish the swap, but then you drop out just trying to waste their time and cost them transaction fees. In this way you lose out the dex fee and they lose on their transaction fees, but it can prevent people from spamming as spamming becomes expensive.

[05-Dec-21 09:08 AM] cipi#4502
find out why orders don't match... could be price/volume or error... anything on console?
how did you set the orders? 2 maker orders will not match against each others, one must be a maker order (`setprice` call), the other one a taker order (`buy`/`sell` call)
so you need to place an order with setprice then try to match it with buy or sell


[05-Dec-21 09:11 AM] JohnLogle#1668
@cipi  ok i think i know where is my fault...so stupid....iam always tried in PRUX/LTC   but i have to trade first iniviate tarde sure on KMD/PRUX ....so now i swap my LTC to KMD and will try again to make first PRUX/KMD order for the 5 params in that file


[05-Dec-21 09:12 AM] cipi#4502
you can test with whatever other coin you like


[05-Dec-21 09:18 AM] JohnLogle#1668
interesting in my atomicdex-desktop i can always only use sell function for each market on buy i have not a start swap button, i can only on sell side start a swap?? is that normaly?


[05-Dec-21 09:30 AM] cipi#4502
`setprice` call is not implemented in GUI... but if you use buy or sell on GUI and the order does not match in 20s or so, it will be turned into a maker order automatically


[05-Dec-21 09:31 AM] cipi#4502
so same result as setprice, but after couple seconds


[05-Dec-21 09:35 AM] cipi#4502
it doesn't matter if you use buy or sell, it's actually the same call, just inverted base/rel coin üôÇ


[05-Dec-21 09:38 AM] JohnLogle#1668
now i tried this way sell PRUX/KMD   PRICE=0.1 for 1 PRUX   and on other market KMD/PRUX id sell  PRICE=10 for 0.1KMD now both orders are open first second orders was on matchin state but now booth orders stay open


[05-Dec-21 09:38 AM] JohnLogle#1668
ah can i fill my own order??


[05-Dec-21 09:40 AM] cipi#4502
i would look into orderbook, but i can't, because my node does not know PRUX
the 2 orders need to be from different pubkeys (seed phrases), that's for sure, you can't trade with yourself


[05-Dec-21 09:44 AM] JohnLogle#1668
ok will test around found also in buy swap button it is there but really grey ...


[05-Dec-21 09:45 AM] cipi#4502
you need to fill the values price and volume or select an order from orderbook


[05-Dec-21 09:51 AM] JohnLogle#1668
@cipi  yes i did now with two differents accounts first one order PRUX/KMD   buy pric 0.1KMD 1 PRUX   and with account 2 id sell same amount with same price, but now i see in orderbook booth orders but same price one on green side one on red side but nothin happen, trade was maching order but swap will not start, may  i need both 2 nodes and both account logged in??


[05-Dec-21 09:52 AM] cipi#4502
yes, both nodes/accounts need to stay logged in and connected to internet


[05-Dec-21 09:53 AM] JohnLogle#1668
ah ok thats the problem

[06-Dec-21 08:00 AM] cipi#4502
lookup the privkey of ETH in ADEX Desktop and use that in metamask, then it will have access to the funds on ADEX

Few things on AtomicDEX export trade history, figured I'd bring up here and get thoughts before making a github issue about it.
Exporting transaction history as CSV gives columns an extra space before each column name. This can be annoying when working with the CSV files later. I'm not sure why as I don't know qt or c++ stuff but I see there's a value being passed around like:
```c++
item.rel_amount = value.toString();
...
item.rel_amount.toString().toStdString() << ",";
``` which could be the culprit.
This:
<https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/blob/4c023b1780a501a3f13ff285018904289b53a494/src/core/atomicdex/models/qt.orders.model.cpp#L65>
Used here:
<https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/blob/ebdb7042d6d97a7bf298363d43ab64741e68b5e6/src/core/atomicdex/models/qt.orders.proxy.model.cpp#L288>

Secondly, it could be helpful to add some additional fields to the csv export, I think `BaseCoinAmountCurrentCurrencyRole` and `RelCoinAmountCurrentCurrencyRole` return the fiat valuation of that coin at that given time. 
Here:
<https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/blob/4c023b1780a501a3f13ff285018904289b53a494/src/core/atomicdex/models/qt.orders.model.cpp#L76>

This would be helpful for those who are looking to add up their total profits/losses in fiat, also for tax purposes. Though I'm partial to exporting the kitchen sink and letting people work with all the data anyway.

Shoot an email to partners@komodoplatform ,  I will get to it in the morning,  just FYI listing as default in mobile and desktop has a 10k usd fee.

Hi can i use the same seed phrase when downloading to the new desktop app?


[10-Dec-21 12:15 PM] cipi#4502
sure, new version should actually see your existing wallet (so no need to create/restore a new one), so you will need only the password to login, since the seed phrase is stored in the wallet

you need BNB for BEP20 tokens, including BNB itself
ETH for ERC20 tokens, including ETH itself
MATIC for PLG20 tokens, including MATIC itself
and so on... all those chains work the same... it's not a ADEX specific stuff, it's how they operate

it literally is
I get tokens sent __daily__ to addys with no parent coin balance


[10-Dec-21 03:29 PM] cipi#4502
lol, how that? the addy must have had a balance once... else it is not known
but i know, i get a lot of random BS-tokens on all the adresses ever used


[10-Dec-21 03:30 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
Not once has a client said, "I can't pay you in ETH because the addy you gave me has never had ETH and ETH will not let me send you ETH until you get some ETH"


[10-Dec-21 03:30 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
if that were how it worked, I wouldn't have ever had ETH


[10-Dec-21 03:32 PM] cipi#4502
if you create a new key, you know the address associated with it, but nobody else knows, eg the block explorer


[10-Dec-21 03:34 PM] cipi#4502
pretty sure those dudes sending random tokens to addresses don't send them to really random ones, but to ones that were used, have at least one tx associated with them


[10-Dec-21 03:38 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
I'm not talking about rando dudes
I'm talking about clients that wish to pay me in ETH
They get given an addy that has never been used and they send ETH to it
This is basic wallet security 101

[10-Dec-21 05:03 PM] cipi#4502
the version works the same as the other ones in that regard
so either the error message is wrong or it means something else
what did you want to do here? buy SMTF with KMD?
is that a SMTF sell order you hovered there?


[10-Dec-21 05:03 PM] cipi#4502
what was your BNB balance at that point in time?


[10-Dec-21 05:05 PM] cipi#4502
if it was 0 and you tried to buy SMTF with KMD and your KMD balance was > 0, then the error message is simply wrong and it should mean "not enough BNB"

there is already the info cex-rate, which compares the price to the one from binannce/nomics/gecko/paprika and "best orders" which does that for all orderbooks of that coin you want to buy or sell

but that would be a price that is external, calculated based on some values gathered from 3rd party...
maybe as a hover, but when i buy something i want to know the price as it is in orderbook


[10-Dec-21 06:02 PM] cipi#4502
this is Binance KMD/BTC... the value in the middle between bids and asks that shows it in USD would be nice... but only one value, not for all entries in orderbook, those should be the original ones
that values is already present, would just need to be shown there

[13-Dec-21 03:55 AM] Regnar#6164
thanks. Might be cool to add for eventual hardware wallet support. Then you could swap "hot" assets directly into a hardware wallet address and save on tx fees. Additionally this could be helpful for third party providers who are looking to setup a shapeshift type interface. Website with pairs, they show you the order, you send to their address and they start the swap with your address as the recipient address.

coingecko_id is configured, but last trade recorded by coingecko is 7 days old, so the price is not used
instead nomics is used https://nomics.com/assets/fjc-fujicoin/markets
coinpaprika could also be used, but FJC is set to inactive there, so you need to contact paprika and make them fix it

yes, crontab entry looks like this
`0 10 * * 6 sudo systemctl stop electrumx_LTC && COIN=Litecoin DB_DIRECTORY=/electrumdb/LTC electrumx_compact_history && sudo systemctl start electrumx_LTC` for a weekly restart
but the exact command depends on how you set up electrumx... i use a systemd service for each coin, so i can do `sudo systemctl start electrumx_LTC`, but that depends...

@cipi is this correct I am almost sure I wouldn't have needed the specific coin in order to complete the trade , only the bnb gas fee for bep-20 tokens for example

yes, all BEP20 txfees are paid in BNB, no matter which BEP20 token you trade... and you need only BNB

SMTF-v2 fees is the takerfee (0.15%, or 1/777 of traded amount)
MATIC fees are for the Polygon chain (EURS-PLG20)
BNB fees are for the BEP20 chain (SMTF-v2)


[16-Dec-21 07:03 PM] QualityASSURANCE#1813
sorry about that yeah I was reading the pair incorrectly


[16-Dec-21 07:05 PM] cipi#4502
but 1$ BNB fees is too much, the actual fee on BEP20 will be more like 0.2 - 0.3 (0.1 to 0.15 for each tx, takerfee sending and takerpayment sending)


[16-Dec-21 07:07 PM] cipi#4502
the estimation is simply too high, the actual fee will be lower... you will see it after swap completed and you view the involved txes... check the one on BEP20 chain...


[16-Dec-21 07:10 PM] QualityASSURANCE#1813
thanks again @cipi , one last Q at the moment there is no way of adding custom PLG-20 tokens on the current version right?

It's not a priority as far as I know. And yes atomic swaps on Monero are not easy and have lot of security issues.

My iOs Dex wallet has expired.  So I installed Atomic DEX v0.5.4 beta for Windows.  I used the same Wallet seed I used when I setup the DEX wallet (and the same I used in QT wallet previous to the beta) but my balance is now 0 KMD.  I had 9529KMD in the iOs DEX wallet.  Do I need to wait for something to sync before my balance shows?  Also when I setup this new beta wallet it asked for a wallet name, which I never had to use before.  Would that have any effect on my balance not syncing?         (I also posted this under the general support group)


[02-Jan-22 10:02 AM] Regnar#6164
You should confirm you put the seed phrase in exactly. No capital letters, no spaces before the first word, none after the last word. one space between each word. You can look at your transaction history in the wallet (with 0 balance) if you don't see any transaction history it's a good indicator you have a typo in your seed.


[02-Jan-22 10:03 AM] Regnar#6164
For wallet name, it's basically a way for you to save your wallet seed with a password/name for easy access. You should be using the restore wallet button to input your iOS seed.


[02-Jan-22 10:04 AM] smkhound#7640
you can double check spelling at https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt


[02-Jan-22 10:04 AM] spudboy999#5256
ok I will check that.  The layout for the seed input isnt the usual 24 blank fields that I am used to.  So i probably did hit space an extra time or something


[02-Jan-22 10:28 AM] spudboy999#5256
I have tried re-entering my seed into a new imported wallet and I still get a zero balance.  I know I have the correct seed because I had it written down in two different places.  I also know I used that seed to setup the now expired DEX iOs wallet because I was earning 20-30KMD every reward cycle.


[02-Jan-22 10:28 AM] spudboy999#5256
Is there any way to re-enable my iOs wallet so I can send my KMD to my Exodus wallet?


[02-Jan-22 10:32 AM] spudboy999#5256
I also had 30LTC in that wallet...


[02-Jan-22 10:34 AM] spudboy999#5256
When did the beta expire?  Was it before Dec 23, 2021?


[02-Jan-22 10:36 AM] Regnar#6164
Try importing it again and selecting "allow custom seed"


[02-Jan-22 10:43 AM] spudboy999#5256
That didn't work....I am super bummed...that was over $11k in cryptos I no longer have ...all because the wallet it was in won't let me use it anymore...


[02-Jan-22 10:43 AM] spudboy999#5256
I know the receive address of my LTC for the wallet, but I don't for the KMD...


[02-Jan-22 10:46 AM] Regnar#6164
don't worry. If you have the seed you have the funds. Especially if you are opening a wallet that has a different address than original. This is likely just an issue with the seeds translating between wallets


[02-Jan-22 10:48 AM] smkhound#7640
if the ltc receive address isnt the same  as you get for the seed imported into desktop, its not the right seed.


[02-Jan-22 10:48 AM] Regnar#6164
Just to confirm, you are using a single space between words, you are not copy and pasting from a MS word document, you aren't using capital letters, and you used the regular methods to generate a random seed


[02-Jan-22 10:49 AM] smkhound#7640
spellings normally what gets me


[02-Jan-22 10:49 AM] spudboy999#5256
I am typing it in and only a single space


[02-Jan-22 10:49 AM] spudboy999#5256
no caps


[02-Jan-22 10:49 AM] spudboy999#5256
when was the last day the wallet worked?


[02-Jan-22 10:49 AM] Regnar#6164
is the LTC receiving address the same?


[02-Jan-22 10:51 AM] spudboy999#5256
no its not the same LTC address...I could have sent them elsewhere.  I moved them from Bittrex on Dec 23.  So If the DEX wallet expired before that date my LTC is in another wallet


[02-Jan-22 10:52 AM] Regnar#6164
The wallet expiring wouldn't change the seed or wallet addresses.


[02-Jan-22 10:52 AM] spudboy999#5256
Yeah but I would have to have gotten the address from the wallet to do it


[02-Jan-22 10:53 AM] spudboy999#5256
I didn't have it saved anywhere


[02-Jan-22 10:53 AM] Regnar#6164
If the LTC address isn't correct then there is an issue inputting the seed. Either typo or the format is off (allow custom seed, or not allow custom seed, try both)


[02-Jan-22 10:53 AM] Regnar#6164
the only thing you need is the seed


[02-Jan-22 10:54 AM] spudboy999#5256
What day did the iOS DEX wallet stop allowing logins?


[02-Jan-22 10:57 AM] smkhound#7640
I'm on android. as far as I'm aware its a regional thing, and if it was via testflight, I think expiry is set amount of days from first installation so it varies.


[02-Jan-22 11:01 AM] spudboy999#5256
yeah I was on testflight


[02-Jan-22 11:09 AM] Regnar#6164
Have you used to Eye button when you are importing your seed to ensure it is exactly correct?


[02-Jan-22 11:16 AM] Regnar#6164
The reason I'm stressing seed accuracy so much is because if you are importing a seed from another AtomicDEX wallet, it should work fine. The fact you are getting different addresses (and likely no transaction history) indicates that the seed isn't exactly the same, that a slight difference in the seed is just opening a *new* address. If you were getting the same addresses with transaction history moving funds, it would be a problem.

maybe someone else can jump in and point something out that I'm missing, but a seed that worked in AtomicDEX mobile should work in AtomicDEX Desktop without any issues. 

You could also try importing the seed into Verus Desktop wallet and see if the addresses are correct there. If you are seeing the same addresses as you are seeing in AtomicDEX, it would be a strong indication you are importing a different seed.


[02-Jan-22 01:18 PM] spudboy999#5256
I installed Verus desktop (windows 64bit) but I cannot find anywhere in the app to either import a wallet with a seed or restore a wallet with seed.  Do I need to wait for it to fully sync before I can do that?  (its at 0% currently for the KMD blocks)


[02-Jan-22 01:19 PM] spudboy999#5256
When I create a new profile it only asks for a profile name, it does not give any options for anything else.


[02-Jan-22 01:24 PM] spudboy999#5256
If we can convince Testflight to allow the wallet to open I can see what the actual seed is I used in that wallet.  I am starting to believe I messed it up somehow.


[02-Jan-22 01:30 PM] Regnar#6164
You would import it as a light wallet, not a full node. Not sure if you can import a seed into a full node wallet from the GUI


[02-Jan-22 02:55 PM] Panho#7078
Dear @spudboy999  you mentioned Exodus wallet.
Exodus wallet and ADEX use different derivation paths for the same seed phrase. Check it.


[02-Jan-22 02:58 PM] spudboy999#5256
Exodus uses only 12 words for the seed, all my KMD wallets are always 24 word seeds..

{Reactions}
‚òπÔ∏è 

[02-Jan-22 07:31 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
12 words is in the realm of crackable


[02-Jan-22 07:49 PM] spudboy999#5256
With quantum computing all our seeds are crackable...at least 12 seed words are more secure than a 3 digit credit card security number...


[03-Jan-22 04:39 AM] Regnar#6164
That may be true but still pretty far off from having QC break modest level encryptions. 

This comes down to a simple numbers game though. 12 seed words offers less variability in the creation of a public/private key pair. The key pair is still the same size as keys from 24 words but it is less variability in the generation which means it is *easier* to generate more combinations and possibilities to find someones key. Not to say this is at all *easy* as there is still a ton of combinations, but there are significantly less to try.


[03-Jan-22 04:41 AM] Regnar#6164
Komodo is pretty well positioned for the transition to quantum resistant key pairs though, while Dilithium is available to smart chains right now it's plausible that it could be enabled in KMD if needed. But that's getting a bit off topic for this channel <https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-api/dilithium.html>

Hi there, I would really like to be able to use AtomicDEX Wallet on an offline PC(i.e. one with no network connection) to be able to safely store my wallet. Then I would like to use AtomicDEX Wallet on a different PC or a smart phone and use it as a viewing wallet and to broadcast transactions after I have signed them with my offline PC. I currently do this with Armory Secure Wallet however it only supports Bitcoin and now I would like to start using other coins so I came across your wallet. Can you please implement this?


[04-Jan-22 04:50 AM] TonyL#3577
@skysthelimit707 Hi! We do plan to add hardware wallets support (Trezor/Ledger) this year


[04-Jan-22 04:56 AM] TonyL#3577
Thank you for feature request, but unlikely we'll implement offline transactions generating and custom raw transactions broadcast in AtomicDEX GUIs soon. Transactions signing with hardware wallets will provide a similar level of security.

Hello guys, I managed to compile AtomicDesktop on Ubuntu 21 myself and because we have a UTXO coin (DOI/Doichain) already merged with the coins repo. I could find our DOI inside the coins file in build folder. So far I couldn't find it inside Atomic Desktop under assets. Is it necessary to creat liqudity in the AtomicDex-API first? Or is there another trick so it gets enabled in the self compiled version? Any hints?

Swap was about 4246 smtf...how much fees i need for this? How can i know how much i need?


[05-Jan-22 08:32 AM] gcharang#6833
atomicdex does the calculation and not configurable by user. in this case, atomicdex seems to have underestimated the fees? cc: @cipi


[05-Jan-22 08:34 AM] CHMEX#0686
@lpdz011 i was on the otherside of that swap


[05-Jan-22 08:34 AM] lpdz011#9233
Yeah i know that i cant config the fees but it should be possible to see how much fees i have to pay when i create the order

I had round about 0.11 bnb but it seems to be not enough


[05-Jan-22 08:36 AM] CHMEX#0686
Bnb was enough but somehow the trx didnt go trough


[05-Jan-22 08:37 AM] lpdz011#9233
But if i create an order adex should check if i have enough fees or not?


[05-Jan-22 08:37 AM] CHMEX#0686
Yes i have enough fee


[05-Jan-22 08:37 AM] CHMEX#0686
Needs about 0.001 or so


[05-Jan-22 08:37 AM] lpdz011#9233
And me ?


[05-Jan-22 08:38 AM] lpdz011#9233
How much i need for this amount?


[05-Jan-22 08:38 AM] CHMEX#0686
Same as for 1 smtf.... you are the maker...


[05-Jan-22 08:38 AM] lpdz011#9233
How much kmd fees did you lost?

20kmd


[05-Jan-22 08:39 AM] lpdz011#9233
And kmd fees? Or i have only pay 1 smtf  and nothing else?


[05-Jan-22 08:39 AM] CHMEX#0686
U pay nothing as a maker


[05-Jan-22 08:39 AM] CHMEX#0686
Only bnb fee which is 0.15usd in bnb


[05-Jan-22 08:39 AM] lpdz011#9233
Send me your adress please in dm...i refund it to you

Maybe we can find a bug and help improve it


[05-Jan-22 08:40 AM] CHMEX#0686
Maybe you can send the swap logs to the team

@CHMEX swap successful now üëç


[05-Jan-22 09:22 AM] cipi#4502
wgat version is that? if it's not 0.5.4, you need to update, there were some changes regarding fees in mm2
"transaction underpriced" can also happen when there are pending txes from your address still not mined... because chain then thinks you want to update the fee of that previous tx and not post a new one
did you had several txes, pending, at that time


[05-Jan-22 09:23 AM] cipi#4502
but i need to see the entire error message, not the screenshot
because there is a difference between "transaction underpriced" and "replacement transaction udnerpriced"


[05-Jan-22 09:23 AM] lpdz011#9233
Dont have different taxes but i still used 0.5.3


[05-Jan-22 09:24 AM] lpdz011#9233
Maybe that is or was the problem


[05-Jan-22 09:24 AM] lpdz011#9233
But i make a new order and than swap worked fine


[05-Jan-22 09:24 AM] cipi#4502
the fees are changing all the time, just coincidence


[05-Jan-22 09:24 AM] lpdz011#9233
I have sent gcharang the log file


[05-Jan-22 09:26 AM] cipi#4502
the calculation is done differently in 0.5.4 compared to 0.5.3, it doesn't take the value for a "normal" speed tx, it uses average between "normal" and "fast" or something like that... anyway, it will use a higher fee and thus "transaction underpriced" should be gone... that's at least the idea, i hope it's fixed üôÇ


[05-Jan-22 09:28 AM] cipi#4502
oh, yeah, when gas station is down, the used fees will be too low anyway... in 0.5.3... in 0.5.4 even that should still work


[05-Jan-22 09:28 AM] lpdz011#9233
Thank you very much...i will updated as soon as there is an official announcement and the adex autoupdater shows me the new version


[05-Jan-22 09:30 AM] cipi#4502
i don't think there will be an auto updater, afaik it was turned off since it's unreliable

@lpdz011 from inside atomicdex send 3 KMD to RBNBgasHgfPFCyDctsE3DVjhDExE6Vggnw

It will send you back BNB to your bnb address after that you have enought bnb to trade

DM your logs I can have a look. have you tried rebooting? It might be that mm2 is still running (you can also check taskmanager and kill it, assuming windows)


[07-Jan-22 08:11 AM] lpdz011#9233
Hi,

I am a little bit confused regarding fees. 

In my case i talked about smtf - kmd pair.

actually I always thought that maker only pay fees of selling coin... in this case smtf and buyer (taker) pays fees in kmd and binance

But me as maker also pay fee in bnb


[07-Jan-22 08:13 AM] lpdz011#9233
Is this new or is that a bug?


[07-Jan-22 08:16 AM] lpdz011#9233
So i want to buy kmd and sell smtf

I create some orders and takers match my order. And i also matched as taker other maker orders.

In both cases i pay fees in bnb


[07-Jan-22 08:18 AM] gcharang#6833
yes. for ETH and EVM based chains (like BNB) both maker and taker need to spend gas . in EVM chains, any action you do, requires gas


[07-Jan-22 08:21 AM] lpdz011#9233
Ah ok üëå 

Thank you

Is there an easy overview when maker and taker pay which fee ? 
That would be cool.


Sometimes there were small swaps with 10$ volume but i have to pay 1$ bnb fee. Is that normal?


[07-Jan-22 08:23 AM] gcharang#6833
volume of your trade doesn't affect the amount of gas paid. you could even be trading $0.001 worth of tokens and may still spend $1  as gas fees


[07-Jan-22 08:25 AM] lpdz011#9233
Yeah its annoying sometimes when you were maker and takers only swap low volume :-(


[07-Jan-22 08:26 AM] gcharang#6833
I think the GUIs don't support it yet, but as a maker you can set min trade volume for any orders you create in CLi

I know i know but it is not working fine at moment. You can only use slidebar and its not very accurate.  Its also a problem that others cant see, that this order has a minimum amount


[07-Jan-22 08:28 AM] lpdz011#9233

hmmm, strange, i saw this when you use too few gas for the operation, then it uses all the gas you passed, but cancels the operation
but since you used Desktop, there is no way to set this option, so idk why that is
look on the explorer, there should be more infos about the reason

[07-Jan-22 11:09 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
Presumably such would indicate need more ETH and it's not showing the error properly client-side?


[07-Jan-22 11:09 AM] cipi#4502
it looks like it, yes... i wonder too that it simply reverts the tx instead of showing a proper error


[07-Jan-22 11:11 AM] cipi#4502
we switched RPC nodes couple weeks ago from parity/openethereum to https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum ... maybe some messages have changed and mm2 does not understand all of them


[07-Jan-22 11:13 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
and ofc I'd have to be the one to find the borked error :troll: ü§£


[07-Jan-22 11:16 AM] cipi#4502
but since it didn't spend any gas (i assume your ETH balance is still the same as before), you can try again... do you get the same error every time?


[07-Jan-22 11:17 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
correct on both
it did nothing on actual chain and same error


[07-Jan-22 11:18 AM] cipi#4502
ok, it really looks like it simply does not return the correct error and the actual reason is that the ETH you have is not enough to pay the fees for sending the USDC out

Oh yes...i see it now...very nice üëç

Do you think its possible to have an own field where you can decide manualy the amount for the minimum volume? Maybe exchange this field with the slidebar


[08-Jan-22 05:53 AM] Regnar#6164
It's definitely possible. I don't have a say in such things but I personally think we should keep the GUI as simple as possible, not only for the average users sake but also for their trading partner. Altering minimum amounts would just make the orderbook more complicated and finding matching swaps more difficult because more users might be setting arbitrary minimum rates. Just my opinion, abstracting away things like this is the point of a GUI.


[08-Jan-22 06:19 AM] lpdz011#9233
But the point is that we actually have an option to set minimum amount.  But the current version is useless. You cant set a specific amount


[08-Jan-22 06:21 AM] Regnar#6164
Yea I think this comes down to the expected purpose of a GUI. I expect some basic interaction and setting of some features, but generally easy enough to point and click through. More complicated stuff I would use the tools that are designed for that, the API.


[08-Jan-22 06:23 AM] cipi#4502
the slider is not the best solution... hard to use in certain situations, eg when you want to buy COIN with KMD and you have a lot of KMD in your balance, but only want to use like 1% of it
afaik there are some changes planned for next release to the pro view, so i guess this will be addressed too

[08-Jan-22 06:28 AM] lpdz011#9233
I think one more field is not complicated...its very frustrating when someone only take a small amount of your order and the fee is very high compared to volume


[08-Jan-22 06:41 AM] cipi#4502
there are also some other things that could be added to GUI: mm2 supports order types like GoodTillCancelled or FillOrKill
i think an "advanced order options" section beneath the normal options like volume and price would be good, where you can set this and min_volume (as an input field)
maybe only visible when you unfold it


[08-Jan-22 06:46 AM] lpdz011#9233
That sounds good but i have a stupid question...what is goodtillcancelled and fill or kill? üòÖ


[08-Jan-22 06:52 AM] cipi#4502
a GoodTillCancelled order will stay in orderbook till it is either filled or you cancel it
a FillOrKill order is either filled immediately after you post it or it is killed if that is not possible


[08-Jan-22 06:57 AM] lpdz011#9233
Mhhh..but we already have  goodtillcancelled or not? 

And the fillorkill is useless at moment because not enough active user and low volume


[08-Jan-22 07:02 AM] cipi#4502
yes, goodtillcancelled is the default, if your order (buy/sell) does not match after 20s or so, it is turned into a maker order, thus simulating the goodtillcancelled behavior people know from CEXes

Hi guys i have a small problem i have about 80,000 digital price stuck on the adex the explorer shows it as beening in my adex wallet and i can do swaps but when i try to send the balance it gives me insufficiant funds error, this started when i tried to send about 250,000 dp from adex to core wallet (think it was just too much dp at once) is there a way i can get the adex software to do some sort of repair???

Hi i do not mine to my adex wallet, and i cannot send small amounts..... adex thinks i have 0.5 dp when i try to send but i have 80,000.5 in there... i have confirmed this with the explorer so the problem is with adex

I just wanna jump in after not using adex desktop for quite some time and say you all have done exceptional work. The addition of polygon network opens up a lot of possible trades and I am very impressed on how the gui looks now. 

Hats off to you all and thank you for such a great product/tool in the decentralised world.

Hello atomicdex team, would it be possible to add a professional management into atomicdex? lately I've been approached by a dozen of friends/family members that comissioned me to manage their portfolio and theoretically I would have to make a new wallet for each of my "clients" instead of clicking on a button where I can select between different profiles... am I missing something?


[11-Jan-22 02:04 PM] Seko#7408
There is no such thing. User management could become a future feature if demand is high. Personally, I don't see any benefit in it at the moment, it also contradicts a DEX.
Btw, I'm not in the AtomicDEX-Team.

[11-Jan-22 04:20 PM] rustytwilight#5920
If I understand correctly the feature Rizzit requested is a wallet related feature, not a dex related feature, not sure why "it contradicts a dex"


[11-Jan-22 04:22 PM] SHossain#0007
funds management by one person from many users are kinda centralized management around one person. no?


[11-Jan-22 04:24 PM] rustytwilight#5920
So what ? As long as the underlying exchange protocol is decentralized & doesn't have a middleman involved, it is still a dex


[11-Jan-22 04:25 PM] SHossain#0007
you are right in that sense


[11-Jan-22 04:25 PM] SHossain#0007
but, one of the idea of decentralized is being your own bank and your keys your coins


[11-Jan-22 04:26 PM] SHossain#0007
dex and the underlying protocols are still there. but, someone else has ownership of my finds


[11-Jan-22 04:27 PM] rustytwilight#5920
That's the idea of crypto, not the idea of dex


[11-Jan-22 04:28 PM] rustytwilight#5920
And he clearly said that his friends/family give him permission


[11-Jan-22 04:28 PM] SHossain#0007
the way i see it, idea of crypto and dex goes hand in had


[11-Jan-22 04:28 PM] SHossain#0007
that's all good


[11-Jan-22 04:29 PM] SHossain#0007
personally i never hold funds for my family members or friends as i don't want to be a single point of failure for them


[11-Jan-22 04:31 PM] SHossain#0007
if enough users request it and if the team likes it, it might be implemented


[11-Jan-22 04:32 PM] SHossain#0007
@Rizzit maybe put a feature request in github. so, it doesn't get lost in the convo here

Btw I downloaded Atomic Dex on Linux, portable version, ran it but got this error, how can I fix it ?

[11-Jan-22 04:53 PM] Regnar#6164
There isn't this feature yet, though managing different "clients" as different wallet profiles is possible and probably recommended. That being said, I think what you're getting at is a way to swap profiles from within the wallet without having to login and logout, but also so that the Address A, doesn't use funds from Address B. 

To what level of management are you doing for each client? Actively trading on their behalf? Just monitoring their coins? would it not be easier to group coins and just keep track of them via spreadsheet? I think that's basically what major exchanges do when they send coins to cold storage.


[11-Jan-22 07:35 PM] SaltyCroc#4456
Hi atomicDex/Marketing Team, might I suggest that instead of labeling trades as either Expensive/Expedient, include a third category of "Fair". Personally I prefer the terms Discount - Fair - Premium.  The "Fair" category could be as wide as +/- 5%, but perhaps a 2% spread is reasonable. The reason is that seeing a red "Expensive" pop up (even for 0.1% spread) is at least a minor disincentive for trading, and balks the user into reviewing the  CEX prices.

[11-Jan-22 08:01 PM] Rizzit#7059
Yes I want to swap from inside AtomicDex Profile Customer Nr1, 2 3 etc... 

The level of management I'm looking for right now is that I can actively send crypto from the customer wallet to an exchange and back. 
One request was for instance monthly "dividends", so I proposed to invest 25% in KMD/VET etc since its "autostaking" on the wallet level and thus very easy to manage.
At the end of the month send claim to exchange like binance and convert for euro and load their exchange visa card with it. 

It would entirely be possible to just have 1 regrouped wallet and do the transactions per month, but for accounting purposes and also as a marketing "security" argument, having multiple profiles in AtomicDex would be amazing


[11-Jan-22 08:02 PM] Rizzit#7059
I searched a lot for something like this and to be honest I didnt even find anything


[11-Jan-22 08:26 PM] smkhound#7640
you should run `./atomicdex-desktop`


[11-Jan-22 08:26 PM] Rizzit#7059
The way I see it: my "clients" want me to be their "bank". it's either I invest for them or they keep their money in a centralized bank. 

They could download AtomicDex on their own and setup everything, some never turned on a computer & still wants to invest in the "future" 
(to the point of me managing the invested coins after their "death" so their children benefit from it. )

The system we live in is broken to the point people trust us more than banks or notaries.

The log files are empty (size 0). My screen resolution is 1920x1200. For the record, the previous version of atomicdex worked fine. I may have had an issue with my display manager but I think/thought I fixed it, I mean other apps are fine.

I like this idea. There's certainly a psychological effect of seeing things like expensive, fair, discount. having that third category seems like a good idea, I'd prefer 2%. It wouldn't hide the actual discount/premium, but just add an additional category (and color?) to the presentation of the info. Make a request on Github.

@Roger check for zombie mm2s, kill in taskmanager or with `pkill`. If all else fails reboot. That stuck on loading is generally because another instance of mm2 (or atomicdex) is running.

thats multiple days of increasing downloads. Maybe someone knows something?


[15-Jan-22 08:46 AM] Regnar#6164
It's often like that, I'm only tracking the most recent releases and only recently started saving them in this format. usually a release comes out and users slowly download it over the next few weeks (probably by updating their current versions) then when a new version comes out it starts all over back to 0 downloads. I changed my format around so hopefully I can track the changes in the versions too

It's not perfect, it definitely counts duplicate downloads, but the data is just for info purposes

if you add up each release type (win, mac, etc) the total (all downloads since creation on 2021-12-29) = 1006 and that chart shows nearly 2k in 1 day

edited for amount since I initially did the math

You're right, found out why too. I was testing adding the Turkish telegram bot and ran this manually (normally just cron) and didn't delete the extra run from the CSV.

That should be total downloads for that release. So everytime a new version comes out, it'll start back over at 0.


[15-Jan-22 02:21 PM] Regnar#6164
Not sure tbh, that was a lot higher number than I expected to see, it isn't "unique users" since someone could download it more than once, but I don't think that's very likely. Ah, that DogeDEX is version 0.4.2, so it's pretty far behind and those numbers are downloads since April 2021

i guess the problem is that the block explorer of EFL is stuck https://chainz.cryptoid.info/efl/ (last block 6h ago)
but the EFL electrums are OK, i checked them, they are all on same height, which is ~2079166

if you custom add it yourself, only other people who have custom added it or people looking at 3rd party orderbook sites will see it.
If you PR it to the repo, it will be seen in the next release after it is merged.

Hey all, I have a bit of a technical question in regards to the arrrtomic swap method I am hoping somebody here can help with. I am trying to understand exactly what rule allows for a transaction on the Pirate asset chain to a transparent address. 

To add context with an example, notary nodes on the Pirate chain are able to send from sapling to a transparent address as the network checks the public key exists in the whitelisted notary nodes (`komodo_defs.h`). A normal user can not send from sapling to multisig because you get the expected error: `"message": "16: bad-txns-acprivate-chain"`

So my question is, what specifically are the rules that allow sending funds from a sapling address to a transparent multisig address in the arrrtomic swap process in atomicdex/MM2? ... or am I misunderstanding how exactly the arrrtomic style swap functions? üòÜ 

Thanks in advance for your help üçª

@scott (notfromthefuture) there are exceptions for certain styles of p2sh outputs

if you need technicals just ping me here


[18-Jan-22 12:48 AM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
Thanks. I appreciate your help and hope to not waste much of your time. What those exceptions exactly are is what I am trying to understand. 

If I create a mutisig address and send a raw transaction it fails, though it seems to meet the requirements for the `invalid_private_taddr` flag to be dropped. 

From what I can tell there are essentially 5 rules that it checks, > season 5, 0 inputs, 2 outputs, IsPayToScriptHash, and IsRedeemScriptReveal, which all seem to be met, but I admittedly dont understand enough to know what might be failing, especially with the last function. 

I am creating a basic raw transaction with `z_createbuildinstructions` with the input txid and index, and teh output has address (a p2sh) and amount. I created teh multisig with `createmultisig` and also tried with `addmultisigaddress` to see if any difference. 

So there must be something I am missing here. Something that is required in the Tx, or some other check it is failing to remove the zs->taddr flag.

You are forced to reveal the full script in an OP_RETURN following a specific format

I do a lot of helping on the Pirate servers (I am a fist mate there for whatever that means), and am also looking to expand some documentation. For this, I need to better understand this  process because it may open up some doors for interoperability with other chains (specifically some things discussed with Qortal and Fox) and I believe it can lead to some apps I would like to create for the Pirate community

use that explorer's api to look at the transaction in detail


[18-Jan-22 04:09 AM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
Hey @Alright, thanks again for the help earlier. You asked I follow-up in a few hours as it sounded like you may have some examples you can share. 

Earlier you linked the transactions from the rick/zombie swap. I see in the explorer the OP_RETURN that decodes to the expected format checked in IsRedeemScriptReveal(), which the format makes sense for me now.

The rpc command `z_createbuildinstructions` does not appear to accept the "data' key in the output array object. Is there a different key word, or must I build the OP_RETURN tx some other way? Do you have an example of creating the raw transaction that includes the expected OP_RETURN data?

Thanks!

I don't exactly recall how I was creating them when I wrote that consensus code. Let me try to find my notes


[18-Jan-22 05:24 AM] Alright#0419
@scott (notfromthefuture) 
`komodo-cli -ac_name=ZOMBIE z_sendmany "zs1w5d4qzlm0g0vsxtp2px5e4xq4ymww037ypxg4wen753uvjp02scj5eudraafas48x7w57hcun3n" '[{"address": "bVyj6SUygkNqptdQapvZF726tyg1Bo7QZL" ,"amount": 1.0, "opreturn": "6304eb319c60b175210332116904ade54b600629823adf62784fd251c71fbc1f019255ea8e23d7ef8eafac6782012088a9140000000000000000000000000000000000000000882102be7fd8f4ad2530375951c0dc9fec73c7588220d0fbfac45ea17eb360aada72bcac68"}]'`
here is an example of creating the z->p2sh transaction


[18-Jan-22 05:25 AM] Alright#0419
the script in the opreturn field must correspond to the address provided


[18-Jan-22 05:25 AM] Alright#0419
otherwise you should be able to do literally that command after changing the z address to one with funds


[18-Jan-22 05:30 AM] Alright#0419
that example relies on the version of z_sendmany found here 
https://github.com/alrighttt/komodo/blob/ARRR-HLTC-debug/src/wallet/rpcwallet.cpp

it was never added to production branches as it was expected that atomicdex(or a fork) would handle this

The eth fee is so high that the minimum is set to that amount on polygon

The eth fee? Excuse my ignorance but there is no eth fee on polygon, just polygon matic fee regardless of what you are swapping. 

Makes sense on eth L1, that gets wild.

Makes perfect sense


[21-Jan-22 02:52 PM] Slyris#2880
Did you use the simple trading view?


[21-Jan-22 02:52 PM] Redman#2839
Nah I was using pro and posting an order


[21-Jan-22 02:53 PM] Slyris#2880
Ok normally it should turn into an maker order after 30 seconds


[21-Jan-22 02:54 PM] Redman#2839
It didn't get posted at all. In the logs it shows minimum 0.96  (rounded) matic needed.


[21-Jan-22 02:54 PM] Slyris#2880
Also if you are posting an order there is also a min_vol of trading which is probably 0.96 Matic in this case


[21-Jan-22 02:55 PM] Slyris#2880
Because it's suppose that you are a taker, and show 0.13% of your trade + transaction fees


[21-Jan-22 02:55 PM] Slyris#2880
But if you are not matched within 30 seconds you became a maker and will pay only transaction fees if you get matched later


[21-Jan-22 02:56 PM] Redman#2839
I assume it is also taking into account multiple transactions to fulfill order so all orders can go through.


[21-Jan-22 02:56 PM] Slyris#2880
No it take into consideration for one order, that's why you can adjust the min vol you are expecting for your order.


[21-Jan-22 02:57 PM] Slyris#2880
For example you want to trade 10matic and you want a min order of 9 Matic then it's possible by scrolling the left part of the double scroll on the pro view


[21-Jan-22 02:57 PM] Slyris#2880
Left side is the min trading amount right side is the trading amount

could we imagine borrow from smartfi, convert to several cryptos and then provide liquidity on atomicDEX with a margin of +3/5%  ? If the volume is sufficient I guess to loan should not default. For the loan collateral, maybe a token could be sold and the amount of token held dictates the rewards obtain from the atomicdex trading ?
I guess everything I'm saying is not new, maybe you already have something like that in mind with smartfi ? In my opinion liquidity is a prerequsite to retain atomicdex newcomers.

create a new GitHub Action by adding a .yml file inside the .github/workflows directory. For example: .github/workflows/create-diagram.yml

add the actions/checkout and githubocto/repo-visualizer Actions

Add the diagram image to your README: ![Visualization of the codebase](./diagram.svg)

Once you push, you can watch the Action run in the Actions tab of your repository. Within a minute, you should have a visualization of your codebase in your README. Watch it update whenever the code is updated!

to use custom electrums, you need to edit your user's copy of https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/blob/dev/assets/config/0.5.4-coins.json
it'l be in the userdata area of your OS, near the logs (easiest way to get there is by clicking "view logs" in settings). It'll be named something like `0.5.4-coins.WALLET_NAME.json`

Hi! i was compile atomicdex api mm2 on RPI (armv7), to use pyTomixdex_makerbot. I was copy "mm2"and "libmm2.a" in the makerbot dicretory. The script runs good, get connection and activate coins with right balance, but when its time to activate bot/put orders i get the next error on screen: 

{'mmrpc': '2.0', 'error': 'No such method', 'error_path': 'dispatcher_v2', 'error_trace': 'dispatcher_v2:103]', 'error_type': 'NoSuchMethod', 'id': None}.

 At mm2_output.log i get:

mm2.1 branch, with lastest commit

the error about `eth_feeHistory` can be ignored... mm2 tries to get the fee with 3 or so different methods, one of them is eth_feeHistory... but that method is not supported on all chains, so it gets an error from those that don't support it... but one of the other methods was for sure successful, so mm2 has a fee


[21-Feb-22 08:57 AM] david.emmanuel#3425
The problem its that the bot does not run, fail the process. On x64 version i dont get this error, maybe another mm2 version also.

Hi,

The worst part of trading with AtomicDex is that the trading time you make/sell at a good price takes 30 minutes, while you will get good results with this price movement, the user closes AtomicDex and your buying/selling opportunity unfortunately disappears. Do you have;

In other words, when the transactions are 2/3 and the coin is deducted from my account, all transactions are canceled and take hours because the other party closes the application!

that could be, BTC has a high min trade value

As far as I know AtomicDex is the only DEX that lists LBC.  I don't want to mess with a CEX and I don't need a whole lot.  I see I can swap the BTC I have for ~140 KMD on Stealthex.  Is there a lot of liquidity for KMD and a lower minimum?  Would that be best to trade to first?


[23-Feb-22 10:12 AM] smkhound#7640
BTC has transaction high fees so it's not popular unless it is large amounts. BTC-BEP20 is an alternative

Ok, I'll swap to KMD first and see what happens.

[23-Feb-22 11:38 AM] cipi#4502
there is a fixed min_trading_volume of 0.00777... 0.00777 BTC ~ 300 USD...
anyway, i would look for other base coins instead of BTC
i am using KMD; LTC, BCH, DGB, DOGE, DASH, RVN, ZEC and some stable coins, so take a look in those orderbooks


[23-Feb-22 12:07 PM] cipi#4502
using the best_orders feature of ADEX Desktop is better anyway and then pay the LBC with the coin with the best offer... this output is from buying 1000 LBC...

..... or, it's an arbitrary number we picked out our asses because *someone* has a fetish for 777


[25-Feb-22 11:13 AM] Jimm B.#9993
the basic idea was maybe good but I think that people are being deprived of the freedom to decide for themselves.  I'm not used to that from komodo.


[25-Feb-22 11:18 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, change it to 0.01 or 0.005, whatever, but 0.00777 is about 10x peak level txfees, so we get 10% fee during feemarket peaks and 2% fee during normal times. BTC is not really usable for small amounts of any type of transaction, seems better to protect users from burning high percentage on txfees as 90% wont read any warnings and they will complain about lost funds after the fact


[25-Feb-22 11:18 AM] jl777c#5810
the issue is that both sides needs to agree on the minimum amount, so if each user sets it, then there would be unmatchable orders in the orderbook, which would need to be explained

not our fault that BTC is unusable for small tx, anybody has the freedom to fork the code, remove the limits and ordermatch with others. but for a user convenience GUI, minimizing support is the right decision


[25-Feb-22 11:20 AM] jl777c#5810
and not burning 40% on txfees will be much less support than the people that want to swap 0.001 btc and pay 0.0004 txfee (twice)


[25-Feb-22 11:21 AM] jl777c#5810
that is 80% of the swap value on txfee. if you really want to do that and you can find another person to do that, just do manual send first and hope they return. you will end up losing less in txfees that way and the value is small so risk is small

is this a priority in development?  (lightning swaps in AtomicDEX).  Or rather something for the distant future?


[25-Feb-22 11:38 AM] jl777c#5810
that is the right question, instead about complaing about not being able to pay 80% in txfees


[25-Feb-22 11:42 AM] smkhound#7640
It is being worked on - https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/pull/1210

in your scenario you assume extremely high fees, which is not always the case.  I can think of the following comparison: a mother tells her child that it has to wear a winter jacket for protection even though it's summer.  this is how i feel when i see the average transaction fee is 0.000038 BTC ($1.46).  However, now I understand the decision for the min volume better.
 Thanks for your point of view james.

Does anybody know when there will be the next AtomicDex-Desktop Release? Are you working on the stable release or next beta?


[28-Feb-22 03:53 AM] TonyL#3577
Next release publishing is planning in 1-2 weeks. It'll have stable beta status

Our Doichain (DOI) got merged with AtomicDex Desktop (and API) some weeks ago. Is there anything we must do that it will be going into stable release or is this automatically? The mobile wallet needs another PR & merge and any contacting with you?


[28-Feb-22 04:45 AM] TonyL#3577
Since it was merged into API and Desktop it'll be the part of the next release automagically. Mobile GUI uses premium listing system right now, @PTYX is the right person to contact ref. that

not with those instructions

okay, ty


[09-Mar-22 04:13 PM] smkhound#7640
fair warning, windows can be a b*tch sometimes with building until you get the env right.

always is üòÑ if I compile on Linux, I'll still get the GUI Dex right?

When I do the python -m aqt install portion I get the response,
```The packages ['qtwebview', 'qtwidgets'] were not found while parsing XML of package information!```

seems the only available qt modules are: ```debug_info qtcharts qtdatavis3d qtlottie qtnetworkauth qtpurchasing qtquick3d qtquicktimeline qtscript qtvirtualkeyboard qtwebengine qtwebglplugin```for the win10msvc2019_x64 setup

[10-Mar-22 05:29 AM] cipi#4502
is there a special reason why you want to compile it yourself? github already does that for you, for all OSes, you just need to enable the github actions and maybe edit the file https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/blob/dev/.github/workflows/atomicdex-desktop-ci.yml


[11-Mar-22 01:01 AM] mercurious#8555
@Kainan wanted to try some kind of experiments to try to bridge and create wrapped tokens of Ignition on ETH or Polygon or something and asked me to get him a compiled gui that included the 0.5.5 changes - dont ask me how haha


[11-Mar-22 04:13 AM] cipi#4502
use the github actions, it compiles for you every time you make a commit, just like https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/actions


[11-Mar-22 07:34 AM] Kainan#5446
Alright mr Merc, i have a confession. I really just wanted a compiled GUI that I can redistribute ahead of the next release, don't actually need it to start working on wrapping xD


[11-Mar-22 09:49 AM] Slyris#2880
It's because aqt install changed their option / cli usage, please refer to the last readme <https://github.com/miurahr/aqtinstall>
