```From my testing on DICEv1 anyone looking to improve it needs to start with the following:
1) Show if the contract has entropy TX in diceinfo 
2) Have a table end parameter on table creation, where the dice contract expires and the funds can be withdrawn by the creator
3) Figure some solution to scale, a single table can only take so many parallell bets before it just stops working. 
4) Make a GUI to make it easier for people to play
5) Some early ideas for 51% attack problem:
The 51% problem is low chance with close enough dPoW freq... we were gong to try and notarise the chain every 2 blocks as a hacky way to solve it, this could also be solved, by having a single miner, like I have done with STREAMER chain, and have all coins mined out of the faucet.
Or if you want to bet with real money, use a sister chain, where coins are mined bought and MoMoM migrate them to the DICE chain to play dice.```

@TonyL @Mihailo @dukeleto we are working on getting some bounties ready for help and development of kmdice, would be nice for you guys to test CC and look to solve the basic issues

Is this Dice CC? Are there any known issues by now?

They are ot bugs.... problem with how the contract works all together


[18-Oct-18 04:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
The MAIN issue, is ther CC_EVAl can ONLY print data to stderr


[18-Oct-18 04:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
rather than retunr to CLI JSON


[18-Oct-18 04:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
this is an issue with ALL CC contracts I have used

Making useful dapps can be very hard with no/ambigious errors


[18-Oct-18 04:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
and it needs a withdraw


[18-Oct-18 04:28 AM] siu#3920
Or a house edge that can be transfered to a specific pubkey


[18-Oct-18 04:31 AM] Mihailo#5902
Yep, basically I also wanted to solve that somehow as all CC print error in komodo daemon and not returning error on RPC command. It is because if CC function is successful then it returns tx hex but if not then it must return "". As if the string is not empy it can be hex... We can see how to pass the error back so all CC can print error on RPC command.

ability to cheat one's own entropy will accomplish the same thing as withdraw


[18-Oct-18 04:31 AM] Alright#0419
so to withdraw, you'd just cheat your own dice plan over and over

how would you cheat your own entropy?

The game changer here imo is that when tests were done, the chains had almost infinite supply and not much hashrate


[18-Oct-18 05:21 AM] siu#3920
when you have access to so much supply, i can guess its easier to break the bet


[18-Oct-18 05:21 AM] siu#3920
but if supply is scarce and hard to mine, it may be harder.


[18-Oct-18 05:21 AM] siu#3920
just my 2 cents... but lets see what happens.


[18-Oct-18 05:22 AM] Alright#0419
if maxbet or maxodds was lower I'd need to do it a lot more times to drain it entirely


[18-Oct-18 05:23 AM] Alright#0419
need to do it 7 times to drain it with current values


[18-Oct-18 05:23 AM] SHossain#0007
do it. we watch 🍿


[18-Oct-18 05:23 AM] Alright#0419
so maybe snapshot, airdrop to new chain and change maxodds maxbet?

with min bet 0.001 or whatever it is, you can lock the plan with very little coins on odds of 1

the timing to do one will be hard

but I'd only need to do 7

make it to where you need to do a couple hundred, and no one will bother

you never send or receive any transactions with it, becasue if you did it would bodgdown and stop receiving instantly.

once I started reading it... you need to mutex the structure to add or remove and stuff... and there was already code dthat did that.

so I figured just use that

to add to the queue ptr = malloc(sizeof(*ptr))

decode_hex(ptr->data,ptr->datalen,hexstr)

that encodes the hexstring in binary into data[]

So seems pointless... Might see if we can just do it on another chain as it doesn't need to be on this one for any reason

Why would it be on another chain?


[18-Oct-18 06:26 PM] siu#3920
The point is to break this one


[18-Oct-18 06:27 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
breaking is easier than fixing


[18-Oct-18 06:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
I already told you all how to fix it... The only thing not yet done was the actual attack vector commented in the code but at this hash rate its too expensive to carry out, so we would need to do it on another chain like coquo with less hash rate


[18-Oct-18 06:37 PM] siu#3920
Yeah. That is the point of why its being done in one chain


[18-Oct-18 06:38 PM] siu#3920
But thw thing is... give the hashrate and conditions of bet... is it practical to do the attack?


[18-Oct-18 06:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
The bet parametees make it very easy, but obviously some one know knows this and put a shit load of nh on it to make it impossible... Or someone ia nhing it to get the needed supply to carry it out


[18-Oct-18 06:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
7777 kmd is quite a bit

true filling blocks with dice bets made it very angry, the main thing was being able to check for entropy tx before letting you bet... you can kind og get around it, by trying to bet, then if it fails check if the local wallet has balance to make the bet and then you can determine it was entropy tx was the problem.

im just saying if the bet wont submit ... it is usually entroy tx not avalibe ... this will espically the case with te plan on this chain that has only 7 of them, means 7 bets per block.

if the local wallet has balance, then its definatly entropy ... there is an ambigium json returned like "bet transaction failed"

so it the wallet has balance and that is returned... make them wait until a block happens to bet again, might be a hacky way around it ... or try anohter table... but they onyl made one table hre 😂

and they are not able to mine a single block?

entropy tx can be for 0.0001


[19-Oct-18 02:48 AM] jl777c#5810
so a single block can be 250000 entropy tx, which would be quite overkill

The dog chain ... maybe should not be just for STAKEDDOG ... maybe it can be for anything that requires immutable GPS tracking, to know the location of something at any time in the past .


[19-Oct-18 06:17 AM] siu#3920
Maybe alright and blackjoker tested it, but i dont think the idea was the same


[19-Oct-18 06:17 AM] siu#3920
This whole chain is a game


[19-Oct-18 06:17 AM] siu#3920
50% locked, 50% need to be mined to try and unlock thw other 50%


[19-Oct-18 06:18 AM] siu#3920
No other minable chain had been created for this specific purpose

This whole chain is a game, you took something that had no value and turned it into a game, which cannot be won (as long as you play it long enough) but if lucky ... you can get much value


[19-Oct-18 06:18 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe GPS chain is better

@siu  @jorian  how dod you send the funding TX to it ? is it multiple utxo or just 1 giant one ?


[19-Oct-18 09:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think that because of the first bet I made that failed, the entire funding might be stuck

I believe the number of blocks is is set by plan creator. Does anyone know what that was set to? @siu


[19-Oct-18 09:22 AM] siu#3920
600 blocks


[19-Oct-18 09:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
so ... the dicefinish isnt valid until 600 blocks ?


[19-Oct-18 09:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
are you sure ...


[19-Oct-18 09:23 AM] CrisF#3405
Wow!


[19-Oct-18 09:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
dice runs out of mempool and shout return result within seconds unles the plan has been flooded with bets


[19-Oct-18 09:24 AM] siu#3920
we set the timeout at 600 blocks


[19-Oct-18 09:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
timeout .... doesnt mean it has to take that long


[19-Oct-18 09:24 AM] siu#3920
no, it doesnt.


[19-Oct-18 09:24 AM] CrisF#3405
I only had mine at 10.


[19-Oct-18 09:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think thats the maximum it can take


[19-Oct-18 09:24 AM] CrisF#3405
no, so maybe the node is offline?


[19-Oct-18 09:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
Because you can drain the plan, by flooding it with bets faster than it cna process, if the timeout is too low the bettor gets free coins


[19-Oct-18 09:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
maybe all the entropy or funding TX are locked until the timeout ?


[19-Oct-18 09:25 AM] siu#3920
hmmm


[19-Oct-18 09:25 AM] Deleted User#0000

I did the faucet on STKDTROLL with 100 utxo so 100 faucet gets can happen per block

@siu What did  you mean `its getting drained :/`


[19-Oct-18 09:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
the dice must work similar to that


[19-Oct-18 09:26 AM] siu#3920
not drained, just the utxos seem to be getting locked

if I was not sleeping when you launced this, I would ahve been able to let you know

[19-Oct-18 09:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
you can have a long timeout


[19-Oct-18 09:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
if you have lots of utxo


[19-Oct-18 09:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
cc contracts done use the wallet ... so having insanse number of utxo wont slow it down that much at all


[19-Oct-18 09:30 AM] CrisF#3405
I had trouble with less than 10, then got my script working and went sick making utxos.

There was another strange thing that happened before we stopped working on dice.


[19-Oct-18 09:32 AM] CrisF#3405
I started losing every bet.


[19-Oct-18 09:32 AM] Deleted User#0000
I know that for sure ... dice needed to be treated with respect .. if you bet too much too quicly it would get very angry and stop working


[19-Oct-18 09:32 AM] Deleted User#0000
but I didnt set up the tables... and never went back to test what caused what ..


[19-Oct-18 09:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think lots of utxo and a long timeout will help but its untested theory


[19-Oct-18 09:33 AM] CrisF#3405
@smkhound may have experienced that too.  Not sure though.


[19-Oct-18 09:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
the odds did seem to get worse as time went on


[19-Oct-18 09:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
but that was mostly due to the timeout


[19-Oct-18 09:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
I was flooding bets so fast it was ending after timeout and paying me the win


[19-Oct-18 09:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
this is why multiple tables runnign dice finish on multiple nodes is needed


[19-Oct-18 09:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
with smks TUI it could even just randomly choose one


[19-Oct-18 09:34 AM] Deleted User#0000

Sorry.. just one thing .. it appeard to break when I did a bet.. wher the pubkey I bet from was diffrent to the pubkey my deamon was running with... and it sent all change to the wrong address .. is there a utxo that I must spend to clain the win ? 
I think this might ahve something to do with it tbh.

@grewalsatinder  I have most of it working ... converting strings to hex in C code was sending me in circles ... you cant do it with odd numbers 😂  I spent 3 hours debugging something, because i randomly keyboard mashed 3 hex strings of numbers and all of them were an odd length

Although my using wrong -pubkey may have created an invlaid dicebet that was somehow still accetped into a block


[19-Oct-18 10:05 AM] Alright#0419
if dealer didn't do dicefinish/dicestatus within those 600 blocks, better can claim it as a win

yeah it takes a bit of figuring out that staked repo


[19-Oct-18 11:00 AM] jorian#4555
also blocks are getting in slower now


[19-Oct-18 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
@ComputerGenie the way the dice is provably random is that neither side knows both entropy values when they are betting


[19-Oct-18 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
the dealer generates the entropy tx (no idea why the chainmakers dont make more entropy tx with 0.0001 values)


[19-Oct-18 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
but it is only visible as the hash(entropy) the hentropy


[19-Oct-18 11:03 AM] jl777c#5810
the bettor then picks a random dealer hentropy utxo adds his entropy in the clear


[19-Oct-18 11:03 AM] jl777c#5810
now the dealer can tell if it is a win or loss, if he is honest he pays out the wins immediately


[19-Oct-18 11:04 AM] jl777c#5810
if he doesnt and it times out, it must be a loss of dealer, ie automatic win, otherwise the dealer can just never payout wins


[19-Oct-18 11:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
If my node was betting with a pubkey that did not have the WIF in the wallet (daemon started with wrong one ) would that cause an issue with dicefinish?


[19-Oct-18 11:04 AM] jl777c#5810
so, given this, what is the attack vector by allowing users to create entropy tx?


[19-Oct-18 11:04 AM] jl777c#5810
your node wont be able to dicefinish properly, but the dealer node doesnt need any privkeys from the bettors


[19-Oct-18 11:05 AM] Deleted User#0000
ok so my node not being able to claim win/loss even after restarting with correct pubkey is not he issue ?


[19-Oct-18 11:05 AM] Deleted User#0000
all bets are stuck in pending


[19-Oct-18 11:06 AM] jl777c#5810
your node would only ever be able to claim a timeout forfeit win


[19-Oct-18 11:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
ahh ok got it


[19-Oct-18 11:06 AM] jl777c#5810
since there are 7 entropy tx, once they are waiting for timeout, what else can happen


[19-Oct-18 11:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
hmm seems like an error check needed ... its ther for other contracts

if you have only 7  utxo, you can only have 7 bets pending

[19-Oct-18 12:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
that script was for something else entrily ... but I just adapted it to this in 2 mins ..

If one of the miners is charitable he can do it

maybe post the faucet address so whales can donate to it?

Im not at my computer now... @jorian could set the faucet in the same node we have the dice game


[19-Oct-18 01:27 PM] jl777c#5810
anybody can just do a faucetaddress to get the faucet address

@TonyL was going to work on it but he is too busy with oracles

creating one


[19-Oct-18 01:29 PM] jl777c#5810

dice plan owner makes a bet with the dicefinish not being called

its a blockchain dice game,  50% of the coins were premined  and are used as the house, the rest are minable.  to get the premined coins you have to win in the dice game .  you can set your odds and amount to wager,  only available in cli right now

Apparently community is up; solving, testing and figuring solutions for KMDICE Assetchain. A pool is up. Explorer is there, and it got now significant hashrate too. I’d just call it a speculative mining.

I setup a KMD mining pool no problem.  However having trouble with doing the same for an Assetchain i created.  Is there something different about Assetchains to consider for mining?


[19-Oct-18 08:32 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, you need to set the block reward to just the blockreward and not include txfees if you are using coinbase to distribute to miners


[19-Oct-18 08:42 PM] Hypocalese#3688
I set it up as a POW/POS coin.  Could that be contributing to my issues?

@forkwitch try to be gentle with the 51% attack on revealing entropy. it is a known vuln, and needs to be fixed for dice2, but certainly a reasonable bounty for implementing the attack

Thank you@siu i detected a 'risk' and exploited it but also saw the effect of the Notarisation technology when testing attack on EMC2. I have tweeted my finding and information that notarisation hash can safe you when you respect it.

[20-Oct-18 06:13 AM] jl777c#5810
51% immunity would be one of them, but it would need to change the entropy reveal process and add a step. my goal for initial dice CC was to make it realtime

[20-Oct-18 06:18 AM] jl777c#5810
@forkwitch nothing prevents it, i just didnt have time to code and debug the extra hash reveal step


[20-Oct-18 06:19 AM] jl777c#5810
being able to prevent usage of the revealed secret is quite tricky, maybe i didnt have a clean solution yet


[20-Oct-18 06:22 AM] forkwitch#6080
I know it is hard to code than to speak. But when the output from the secret is locked until event Y happen it could be a solution? So secret is revealed but not the full requirement to spend connected outputs.


[20-Oct-18 06:23 AM] forkwitch#6080
I am certain you understand though.


[20-Oct-18 06:24 AM] jl777c#5810
i think an atomic secret reveal is needed, so the dicebet side needs to commit the hash of his entropy and then somehow both sides need to reveal the raw entropy at the same time, otherwise the side that didnt could reorg the chain when it is advantageous


[20-Oct-18 06:25 AM] jl777c#5810
some sort of commit followed by reveal phase that cant be 51% attacked would be needed, sort of the opposite of channels CC that relies on a revealed secret to still be revealed even if the payment tx is invalidated via reorg


[20-Oct-18 06:26 AM] jl777c#5810
and this extra step for dice seems to prevent a 2 second realtime response


[20-Oct-18 06:26 AM] jl777c#5810
something more involved like the CHIPS protocol might be needed


[20-Oct-18 06:32 AM] forkwitch#6080
It is interesting, in the atomic reveal process both side must agree on a special blockheight or other blockchain derived static value for a 'atomic reveal appointment'.


[20-Oct-18 06:34 AM] jl777c#5810
but unless it is a non-interactive process, seems can be stalled. until the nice simple method for this is devised to be 51% proof, it seems KMDICE wont have its full value


[20-Oct-18 06:34 AM] jl777c#5810
there is 10 million locked away that can fund a reasonable bounty for the solution


[20-Oct-18 06:35 AM] jl777c#5810
sort of an interesting dynamic. i know there is a solution, just will be tricky to do

I wonder it might be a good idea to connect gatewaysCC as soon as it will be well tested: so people will able to deposit directly needed currency via gateway and there will be a tables for these currency tokens


[20-Oct-18 08:47 AM] TonyL#3577
You exchange KMD or BTC on KMD/BTC tokens and gamble with it - need KMDICE only for txfee


[20-Oct-18 08:48 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh, but for it needed token bets support from dice2 or liquidity providing on KMDICE/BTCtoken KMDICE/KMDtoken tokenbid tokenask markets of assetCC


[20-Oct-18 08:51 AM] TonyL#3577
It would be great if new dice contract will able to do things like a show random number in range - with it we'll able to make guis for any casino game no matter is it bj, slot or craps. It'll give much more freedom than win/lose result


[20-Oct-18 08:54 AM] TonyL#3577
Like a for blackjack implementation: you have an array with 52 cards - run RNG it choose one from 52, pop card from array, deal to player, run RNG for  51 left, it's choose one, pop it from array deal to player and so on


[20-Oct-18 08:54 AM] jl777c#5810
yes dice2 betting with tokens should be a requirement


[20-Oct-18 08:59 AM] Alright#0419
Can you reliably know when a notarization will happen? Could dealer just wait until it's about to happen and then reveal entropy?


[20-Oct-18 09:00 AM] TonyL#3577
Can't dealer cheat instead of player in such case?


[20-Oct-18 09:00 AM] Alright#0419
no, hash of entropy is revealed right away


[20-Oct-18 09:00 AM] Alright#0419
if it doesn't match, dealer is obviously cheating


[20-Oct-18 09:01 AM] Alright#0419
I know it might not make much sense, just throwing out ideas here, but is there some way to get notarizations themselves to reveal entropy?


[20-Oct-18 09:02 AM] Alright#0419
so by the time entropy is revealed, it's notarized already


[20-Oct-18 09:02 AM] jl777c#5810
it can be that we can just wait for notarization to payout bets


[20-Oct-18 09:03 AM] Alright#0419
Hmmm, not sure I understand


[20-Oct-18 09:03 AM] Alright#0419
if entropy is still revealed in a reorg-able block, won't the problem persist?


[20-Oct-18 09:03 AM] Alright#0419
even if the payout is after the notarization


[20-Oct-18 09:04 AM] Alright#0419
we need some way to make an unconfirmed tx immutable it seems, right?


[20-Oct-18 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
that is why entropy not revealed until after notarization


[20-Oct-18 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
so dicebet would include not the actual entropy, but hash of entropy


[20-Oct-18 09:05 AM] Alright#0419
Ah, I just realized how simple that is


[20-Oct-18 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
after notarized both parties must reveal or forfeit


[20-Oct-18 09:05 AM] Alright#0419
just don't do dicefinish until the dicebet is notarized


[20-Oct-18 09:05 AM] Alright#0419
correct?


[20-Oct-18 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
but this delays things to the notarization, which is a lot longer than 2 seconds it is now


[20-Oct-18 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, the change that is immune to 51% (but slow) is dicebet uses hash of entropy, dicefinish needs both parties to reveal


[20-Oct-18 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
a whole lot of work and loses the 2 second realtime feedback, which is pretty cool and addictive


[20-Oct-18 09:06 AM] Alright#0419
Can we change the frequency at which the chain notarizes?


[20-Oct-18 09:07 AM] Alright#0419
what is it currently?


[20-Oct-18 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess 10, if it was reduced to 3 then it will be faster, but still nothing compared to 2 seconds


[20-Oct-18 09:07 AM] Alright#0419
Yea :/


[20-Oct-18 09:08 AM] Alright#0419
I recall someone mentioning making unconfirmed txs immutable with channels, didn't read into it much though


[20-Oct-18 09:08 AM] Alright#0419
could that be of use? Maybe I misunderstood that entirely though


[20-Oct-18 09:08 AM] jl777c#5810
well the trick that works for channels is exactly the problem


[20-Oct-18 09:09 AM] jl777c#5810
the secret that is revealed is still valid even after reorg


[20-Oct-18 09:09 AM] jl777c#5810
that is the fundamental problem


[20-Oct-18 09:10 AM] Alright#0419
freq 3 would make it even harder to time the reorgs, just saying


[20-Oct-18 09:10 AM] Alright#0419
a lot harder, I struggled to do it at current freq

Probably a dumb question but is kmdice supported in the agama wallet? How do I generate an address?

KMD address will work. it is not yet in Agama

I joined the two pools available and in over 40 blocks neither pool has hit a block. That seems strange to me. Where are the blocks going to?


[20-Oct-18 02:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
Solo miners?


[20-Oct-18 02:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
Will check my pool soon just woke up


[20-Oct-18 02:35 PM] vrcninja#5651
Your pool is still producing 30% of the hash so mathematically it should have hit at least 1 block in the last 40 for sure.


[20-Oct-18 02:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
no worries... I know its difficulty was too low, I was meant to fix ityesterday but never got home


[20-Oct-18 02:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
just fixed the diff ... increased vardiff max to 1024

yes ... trying to fix it


[20-Oct-18 02:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
should be back up .. incresing min diff didt work, had to make extra port  for high diff


[20-Oct-18 02:59 PM] vrcninja#5651
3067 or 3069 for higher difficulty?


[20-Oct-18 02:59 PM] vrcninja#5651
I'm assuming 69


[20-Oct-18 02:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
69 is high diff


[20-Oct-18 03:00 PM] Deleted User#0000

OK pool seems to be fixed... Also removed the 1% fee... which I didnt know was there, and isnt even paying to my address @smkhound  I think you might have some free KMDICE in the staked pool rewards address.

@c2k I'm not the best to answer this.  Might want to wait for Blackjok3r.
This is what was said before though 👆 ```AlrightYesterday at 9:21 AM

[20-Oct-18 09:19 PM] CrisF#3405
Seems to me `3067` and `3069` are the port numbers.
Again, advisable to check this with someone who knows more about what they are doing. (I just tried this for the 1st time yesterday 😉  )

`server stratum+tcp://103.6.12.112 --port 3067 --user <address>` normal port

so if I mine to a KMD taddr for now, as my cli skills are non existant, once a wallet is available on agama I could transfer the priv key and access the KMDICE then?

@siu any other point left you want to say that I am a fool?

no, no


[21-Oct-18 12:36 PM] siu#3920
you are an early adopter


[21-Oct-18 12:37 PM] siu#3920
the vulnerability part is still theoretical... not yet achieved in practive.


[21-Oct-18 12:37 PM] siu#3920
would be nice for people to really try though


[21-Oct-18 12:37 PM] SHossain#0007
Yes @grewalsatinder, you are an early adopter. sell them at 0.15 and that will be double profit for you :abusedsmily:

i dont understand what you just did

I reversed the tx I did with @SHossain

I own 0 KMDICE now.

ok, as in... im pissed at kmdice because what exactly?

I'm not sure why you would be pissed at kmdice mate? 🤔


[21-Oct-18 12:47 PM] siu#3920
not sure what is the reason to giving them back


[21-Oct-18 12:48 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
simple. I sometimes don't get jokes.
you might have joked. I did not like it.
I felt it. I gave those tokens back. I did no valued it anyway.


[21-Oct-18 12:49 PM] siu#3920
i didnt make fun of you


[21-Oct-18 12:49 PM] siu#3920
i actually narrated what you did


[21-Oct-18 12:49 PM] siu#3920
you asked for price and then complained about it being to high


[21-Oct-18 12:49 PM] siu#3920
that is what people that are bargaining do


[21-Oct-18 12:50 PM] siu#3920
i actually thought you were looking to buy lower... thats it.


[21-Oct-18 12:51 PM] siu#3920
anyway... i have no financial gain at all from KMDICE


[21-Oct-18 12:51 PM] siu#3920
would have been nice for you to help on getting some gui models and stuff... but whatever.

It says 2.

2.25


[21-Oct-18 01:10 PM] Llama#1330
Mining reward is 36k daily


[21-Oct-18 01:10 PM] Llama#1330
Right?


[21-Oct-18 01:11 PM] SHossain#0007
2.25 is what i see on a pool


[21-Oct-18 01:11 PM] Alright#0419
yes, @Llama


[21-Oct-18 01:11 PM] Alright#0419
have to consider that more coins could be emitted based on luck though


[21-Oct-18 01:11 PM] Alright#0419
as half the supply is in that dice plan


[21-Oct-18 01:12 PM] Alright#0419
more coins could also be locked though, so....


[21-Oct-18 01:12 PM] siu#3920
there is a halving every 210k blocks.


[21-Oct-18 01:13 PM] Llama#1330
So that person mined for 4 hours at 1 msol and only got 160 ish


[21-Oct-18 01:13 PM] Llama#1330
Shouldn’t they have gotten 6k?


[21-Oct-18 01:13 PM] Alright#0419
no?


[21-Oct-18 01:13 PM] Alright#0419
were they 100% of the hashrate?


[21-Oct-18 01:14 PM] Llama#1330
50%


[21-Oct-18 01:14 PM] Llama#1330
3k*

[21-Oct-18 01:14 PM] Llama#1330
Me lol


[21-Oct-18 01:14 PM] Alright#0419
is your diff set properly on pool


[21-Oct-18 01:15 PM] Alright#0419
you might have port diff set significantly higher than network diff


[21-Oct-18 01:15 PM] Alright#0419
which would make you find a lot less blocks


[21-Oct-18 01:16 PM] Llama#1330
I set it to whatever it said to put it at


[21-Oct-18 01:16 PM] Alright#0419
what said?


[21-Oct-18 01:16 PM] Alright#0419
what do you have for minimum diff on the port?


[21-Oct-18 01:16 PM] Alright#0419
if it's static, what is it set to?


[21-Oct-18 02:34 PM] Llama#1330
The pool @Alright


[21-Oct-18 02:40 PM] Llama#1330
It’s 3877


[21-Oct-18 02:40 PM] Llama#1330
Diff is 3949507


[21-Oct-18 02:42 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
I can only hope that there will come a day when people listen when I say that nh is a waste for low diff chains


[21-Oct-18 02:44 PM] forkwitch#6080
@Llama It is dynamic difficulty and will adjust to your miner. https://pool.forkwitch.com/stats Now we get lot of blocks. Jump in!


[21-Oct-18 02:45 PM] Llama#1330
I don’t think it’s adjusting to my miner


[21-Oct-18 02:45 PM] Llama#1330

[21-Oct-18 02:45 PM] forkwitch#6080

[21-Oct-18 02:46 PM] SHossain#0007
i see 2.66 now


[21-Oct-18 02:46 PM] Llama#1330
It might have adjusted a little. Seems like it’s mining more now


[21-Oct-18 02:46 PM] Llama#1330
I’m just using nicehash as a test


[21-Oct-18 02:46 PM] Llama#1330
That’s probably the problem lol


[21-Oct-18 02:48 PM] forkwitch#6080
lol


[21-Oct-18 02:48 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
using nh is fine, as long as you do it understanding that their min submitted share is generally much higher than required to find a block on a low diff chain


[21-Oct-18 02:49 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
which means that until the chain diff rises, you get less than "expected" number of blocks


[21-Oct-18 02:53 PM] Llama#1330
I jst had an extra $200 and thought "why not"

[21-Oct-18 04:12 PM] jl777c#5810
i have never seen a brand new chain get so many tx/block


[21-Oct-18 04:12 PM] jl777c#5810
could it be that instant dice is addictive?


[21-Oct-18 04:13 PM] jl777c#5810
and at 4Msols, doing a 51% already becomes somewhat expensive


[21-Oct-18 04:15 PM] jl777c#5810
current nicehash mining cost is about 0.04 KMD?


[21-Oct-18 04:15 PM] jl777c#5810
it is 10x less coins per block than PIRATE, so would be comparable to 40Msols on PIRATE


[21-Oct-18 04:16 PM] jl777c#5810
this seems quite popular and already far above the lower hashrate equihash coins and fast approaching KMD


[21-Oct-18 04:16 PM] jl777c#5810
any ssell offers?

any sellers?


[21-Oct-18 04:39 PM] siu#3920

[21-Oct-18 04:39 PM] jl777c#5810
or mining to bet, a lot of bets


[21-Oct-18 04:40 PM] siu#3920
Yeah... just noticed the tx per block. Its quite high


[21-Oct-18 04:40 PM] jl777c#5810
since it is a gamble anyway, maybe people dont care there is a theoretical vuln


[21-Oct-18 04:40 PM] jl777c#5810
submit it to blocktivity


[21-Oct-18 04:40 PM] Alright#0419

[21-Oct-18 04:41 PM] Alright#0419
@siu can you add more entropy


[21-Oct-18 04:41 PM] siu#3920
Now that 2k were donated to chainmakers, i could yes.


[21-Oct-18 04:42 PM] jl777c#5810
it can be 0.0001 entropy tx


[21-Oct-18 04:42 PM] Alright#0419

[21-Oct-18 04:42 PM] Alright#0419

just make 100


[21-Oct-18 04:42 PM] jl777c#5810
have enough entropy tx to stay ahead of the average tx per block


[21-Oct-18 04:43 PM] siu#3920
Ok. Understood.


[21-Oct-18 04:44 PM] siu#3920

[21-Oct-18 04:46 PM] jl777c#5810
these single purpose chains seem quite popular, flaws and all


[21-Oct-18 04:46 PM] siu#3920
No idea. I guess the miners, since there is no selling going on


[21-Oct-18 04:46 PM] jl777c#5810
when ANN?


[21-Oct-18 04:47 PM] jl777c#5810
when polo?


[21-Oct-18 04:47 PM] jl777c#5810
it already has more hashrate than VOT, CMM and even HUSH


[21-Oct-18 04:47 PM] siu#3920
Today i added it to barterdex and agama, ans started with documentation.


[21-Oct-18 04:47 PM] siu#3920
Tomorrow ill do an ANN


[21-Oct-18 04:48 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as you are clear that it isnt complete and we need to eventually hardfork to dice2, it seems ready


[21-Oct-18 04:48 PM] siu#3920
Or maybe just now. Finally my daughters went to bed. So i shouls have some time


[21-Oct-18 04:48 PM] jl777c#5810
and as alright said, the theoretical 51% is not that easy to do, especailly 10x and with the notarizing window so small the timing makes it expensive to guarantee a success


[21-Oct-18 04:48 PM] siu#3920
Other than theoretical vulnerability, which other issue we have? The exposed enthropy?


[21-Oct-18 04:49 PM] jl777c#5810
that is the theoretical 51% vuln, the exposed entropy


[21-Oct-18 04:49 PM] siu#3920
Ok. Understood.


[21-Oct-18 04:50 PM] siu#3920
So its trying to do a double spend on a won bet in the window between notarizations?


[21-Oct-18 04:50 PM] jl777c#5810
but this is a gambling chain and at worst it is a 50% dilution of all coins. ok, so that is pretty bad, but the entire chain being a gamble is sort of cool in a strange way


[21-Oct-18 04:50 PM] jl777c#5810
no, you do a double spend on a losing bet, doesnt matter, and then grind your entropy to win at max size


[21-Oct-18 04:50 PM] siu#3920
The 50% supply locked will be great until someone gets a lucky bet and wins 500k coins hehe


[21-Oct-18 04:51 PM] siu#3920
Then we will have the first lucky whale


[21-Oct-18 04:51 PM] jl777c#5810
so you reorg, the entropy tx becomes unspent and you dicebet with it using a precalculated entropy


[21-Oct-18 04:51 PM] Alright#0419
I think dice plan should have been funded gradually to match emissions


[21-Oct-18 04:51 PM] Alright#0419
at current state, one lucky bet could double the circulating supply


[21-Oct-18 04:51 PM] jl777c#5810
no coin launch is perfect


[21-Oct-18 04:52 PM] jl777c#5810
and maybe it is ok to have this flaw as it allows realtime betfinish


[21-Oct-18 04:52 PM] siu#3920
Still, the lucky whale will still maintain a chain more decentralized than most


[21-Oct-18 04:53 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont see a way to keep it realtime and 51% proof


[21-Oct-18 04:53 PM] Llama#1330

there should be a bounty for a lite wallet that can submit dicebet CC tx

it would require doing cryptoconditions in js

No 51% attack


[21-Oct-18 05:05 PM] jl777c#5810
or maybe notarization freq of 2


[21-Oct-18 05:05 PM] jl777c#5810
seems would make it near impossible to pull off a 51%


[21-Oct-18 05:06 PM] SHossain#0007
should we get it to freq 2?


[21-Oct-18 05:07 PM] jl777c#5810
that will burn up KMDICE and KMD pretty fast, but it would make the 51% have to be done in a couple minutes


[21-Oct-18 05:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
Even 3 is probably fine


[21-Oct-18 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
since 2 divides into 10 evenly, we can deploy the freq:2 in dpowassets and when enough notaries update, it will start notarizing like crazy


[21-Oct-18 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
freq:3 would isolate new nodes from old


[21-Oct-18 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810

freq:2 excludes a 51er practically


[21-Oct-18 05:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
We found possibly issues with momom on freq 3, moving to 5 appeared to help it, but I was told the momom assumes there cannot be 2 notarisations in the same block


[21-Oct-18 05:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
Which was probably the issue


[21-Oct-18 05:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
Would there be any issues with natural reorgs at freq 2?


[21-Oct-18 05:11 PM] jl777c#5810
lets find out


[21-Oct-18 05:11 PM] jl777c#5810
best to find out such things on relatively low value chains

estimated marketcap is $20,000 now


[21-Oct-18 05:12 PM] SHossain#0007
i can update my 2 nodes now if you want with freq 2 and announce for other operators. i guess we have some operators online now

[21-Oct-18 05:15 PM] ca333#0333
We could in general let dpow parties decied on freq if they d be willing to pay more (additional efforts, fees, etc.).


[21-Oct-18 05:15 PM] ca333#0333
In various cases it seems a good thing to do.


[21-Oct-18 05:15 PM] jl777c#5810
even though it is doing more tx per block than KMD just from bets, the total amount isnt so big


[21-Oct-18 05:15 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, we should verify if freq:2 runs stable


[21-Oct-18 05:15 PM] Deleted User#0000

But we had a small amount of nodes


[21-Oct-18 05:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
Momom was much worse at 3 than 5


[21-Oct-18 05:17 PM] ca333#0333
3 is  problem due to new/old iso


[21-Oct-18 05:17 PM] jl777c#5810
but that just confirms that MoMoM 5% issue is related to timing


[21-Oct-18 05:18 PM] jl777c#5810
i think if a new notarization comes in during the MoMoM calc, is the issue


[21-Oct-18 05:18 PM] jl777c#5810
more notarizations, more likely to happen


[21-Oct-18 05:18 PM] Deleted User#0000
Might make a couple of chains with freq 15 and let them migrate 1 coin per block for 24h and see

[21-Oct-18 10:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
There shold ot be any dev fees at all... you need to use Knomp for KMD AC


[21-Oct-18 10:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
My pool has all fees I could find removed ad disabled, as even with a pool fee I was making invalid blocks.

dev fees are from his miner, not the pool

I am not mining any more but there is hash on my pool at it seems to be paying out.

yep, yours working fine

thanks @Deleted User


[21-Oct-18 10:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
no worries.... if @forkwitch  needs any advice on how to set it up let me know... but it was just straight Knomp and ./gencfg.sh with a diffrent pool_configs template.


[22-Oct-18 12:04 AM] forkwitch#6080
@OsTa what is your problem with pool? It is working good if you see: https://pool.forkwitch.com/stats


[22-Oct-18 12:06 AM] forkwitch#6080
Maybe because i have only 1 port with dynamic adjuster if you are trying to mine with CPU or bad GPU. We got 300 blocks in this day. If you mining let me know your address and i can see in the log if diff is good for you. If not i gonna get a second port with dynamic adjuster for all very low hashrate hardware. I have second pool for this normally where you can link 10000 miner workers with mini hashrate. No problem if its from zombies the hashrate then, stratum proxy dont take it as ddos.


[22-Oct-18 12:20 AM] forkwitch#6080
Forkwitchpool has no fee. Charging fee works just fine @Deleted User  but you cant do it though node stratum. Rewrite code section in komodod for assetchain mining when changing sizes of the vouts.


[22-Oct-18 12:21 AM] forkwitch#6080
For example. I charged a fee for first 2 to 3 blocks to test it. Because i had same problem you said when using fee option from config. But when i do it by coding mining part it http://kmdice.explorer.dexstats.info/tx/93aaba1d4612518db896217e732916f1729b2708731ff919d9154d46cf0012ee


[22-Oct-18 12:21 AM] jl777c#5810
there is a bug in the blockcheck if you are using coinbase to make payouts. in that case you need to only distributed the blockreward


[22-Oct-18 12:22 AM] jl777c#5810
changing this would require hardforking all the assetchains, so it lives on for now


[22-Oct-18 12:22 AM] forkwitch#6080
Works good with coinbase for my payout. Can split coinbase value to many output pubkeys. No problem.


[22-Oct-18 12:28 AM] jl777c#5810
even with txfees added?


[22-Oct-18 12:28 AM] forkwitch#6080
@OsTa you are mining with the ZEC - Total Speed: 1956.626 H/s is 2kSol? What is it? A graphic card? I believe I detected your problem. The forkwitch pool have min diff for 3877 maybe little bit to high for 2kSol. I gonna open a second port for weak hardware or post second pool.


[22-Oct-18 12:29 AM] forkwitch#6080
@jl777c sum.vouts -= fee than yes. But If you add fee to calc and split after its errorous because  your consensus rule punish me.


[22-Oct-18 12:29 AM] OsTa#2589
mining with GPU right.


[22-Oct-18 12:30 AM] forkwitch#6080
Ok @OsTa i make you a second port. Please allow a half hour to one hour to take effect.

sorry about the bug. not sure how I messed it up so bad, but once it goes live as an actively used consensus it is so painful to change and only thing that is affected is coinbase cant be used to redistributed txfees. maybe this will be fixed along with sapling

I think KMDICE now has more hashrate than BTCP

next up is KMD at 15Msols


[22-Oct-18 12:39 AM] jl777c#5810
estimamated 7Msols for KMDICE


[22-Oct-18 12:48 AM] forkwitch#6080
As only coinbase is affected in this special and rare case I believe it is nothing that needs a real fix because it is not a real bug. First thaught from me was it is a spammer prevention rule, not bug.


[22-Oct-18 12:49 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, that was the intent, to prevent spamming, but it seems a bug came along for the ride

@jl777c I am in the learning process and i dont want to go into the oracle global db chain with all notarisations. I have parsed the Komodo chain today and now analysed the notarisation information it is a full coverage for security checks. And instead of notarisation db chain I want to make my new CASINO chain with dice CC and roulette CC. I want to create the roulette CC with odd 1/36 1/3 in combination and ask for your help please i have read the dice CC and understand it. I see we can use it LITTLE changed for the roulette CC. We launch CASINO with the dice and roulette! No premine, good bankroll to launch and different mining plan. Sharing more detailswith you with PM.

why not slots also, it is very similar


[22-Oct-18 02:43 AM] jl777c#5810
using dice entropy method, it can generate the require random values


[22-Oct-18 02:43 AM] forkwitch#6080
I love the slot idea, this is gonna be a cool Blockchain Casino!

Anyone selling some KMDICE?


[22-Oct-18 02:44 AM] forkwitch#6080
Videopoker is the same sort of game too?


[22-Oct-18 02:44 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, random numbers against the house -> cards -> eval based on poker rules. I already have code to evaluate poker hands


[22-Oct-18 02:45 AM] jl777c#5810
so it is a single player casino against the blockchain


[22-Oct-18 02:45 AM] siu#3920
Kmdice is in barterdex already. If anyone wants to sell, a mm node would help

ok thanks. 
i know most of you guys use cli but i havent learned yet...any idea when will be available in agama?

[22-Oct-18 02:55 AM] SHossain#0007
@c2k it will be avaialble in Agama in the near future. but, that will not enable games. just wallet features


[22-Oct-18 02:56 AM] c2k#4915
ok got it. just wondering if i start mining if i will be able to see the balance. not sure what the learning curve is for cli but being with kmd since 2017 im guessing i should learn the basics by this point

you can always see your balance in CLI (at least for now)


[22-Oct-18 02:59 AM] SHossain#0007

How do I access the cli on windows?


[22-Oct-18 03:34 AM] SHossain#0007
@Llama get the komodo binaries for windows from here and run them through command prompt https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/releases/download/multios-201810011016-71fc062/komodo_win64_master.zip


[22-Oct-18 03:35 AM] SHossain#0007
to start dice in Windows, you need to type 
```
komodod.exe -ac_name=KMDICE -ac_supply=10500000 -ac_reward=2500000000 -ac_halving=210000 -ac_cc=2 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -addnode=144.76.217.232
```


[22-Oct-18 03:40 AM] siu#3920
Be sure to download the chain-params first


[22-Oct-18 03:41 AM] Llama#1330
where?


[22-Oct-18 03:41 AM] SHossain#0007
if you have used Agama and KMD native or other native assetchain, you should already have zcash-params downloaded


[22-Oct-18 03:42 AM] SHossain#0007
and if you use the command above that will sync the chain for you


[22-Oct-18 03:42 AM] Llama#1330

[22-Oct-18 03:44 AM] Llama#1330
@SHossain


[22-Oct-18 03:45 AM] SHossain#0007
first try to use. if it doesn't work or say you dont' have zcash-params in your computer, then follow the instruction from this linkhttps://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/install-Komodo-manually.html#installing-komodo-on-windows-64-bit-systems

I had a feeling sometimes CC TX were being rejected by pools ...

but couldnt really work it out


[22-Oct-18 06:07 AM] jl777c#5810
it looks like it is not solving equihash properly


[22-Oct-18 06:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
wonder which TX it is ? or if just because full block of them or something ... maybe it just the miner sending them to me... I am not mining any more.


[22-Oct-18 06:10 AM] jorian#4555
So I'm the first to flood a chain solely mined by nomp pools?


[22-Oct-18 06:11 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure. maybe the CC confuses it but really it looks like a normal tx

I think forkwitches is znomp and mine is Knomp .. os they are not the same.

I got it restarted ut my hash is very low now most people rentals ran out or they chainged pools.


[22-Oct-18 06:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
maybe the hash rate is just too low atm ... its always a possibility the invalid solution errors have heppened in the past also.


[22-Oct-18 06:22 AM] SHossain#0007
This kind of stuck can happen when a chain been hit with too much hash for a short time and if you take away the hash (seen that behaviour on smaller hash chains)


[22-Oct-18 06:23 AM] SHossain#0007
in that case, it may take few hours before the next block is mined


[22-Oct-18 06:23 AM] siu#3920
I guess diff needs to adjust


[22-Oct-18 06:23 AM] SHossain#0007

you can mine full blocks just fine ... the onyl error I saw was invalid solution from a miner ... but its not on every solution submitted so seems unrelated


[22-Oct-18 06:28 AM] jorian#4555
59 txns in a block were 24101 bytes, 460 means almost 2 MB

pool is telling you: `"Block decode failed"`
What does the debug.log for the node you're connecting to say at ~ the same time?


[22-Oct-18 06:42 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`"Block decode failed"` comes from the node, so the node should have *something* about it

if you have debug=1 and the block fails and there's nothing in the daemon debug, then the only thing that comes to mind is equihashverify is wonky (did they update?)

            rpcCommand = 'submitblock';
            rpcArgs = [blockHex];
        } else {

[22-Oct-18 07:43 AM] siu#3920
is it being attacked or something?

something about the chain is making it hard for the pools to find blocks

try it


[22-Oct-18 08:51 AM] Decker#3767
we don't need to mine empty blocks, it's easy to modify pool to ignore txes ... we should find a root of issue.

[22-Oct-18 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
seems there is a tx that gets into the mempool that will be rejected


[22-Oct-18 08:52 AM] forkwitch#6080
If we have TXhash i can only ban this one. Maybe better than to remove all transactions.


[22-Oct-18 08:52 AM] Alright#0419
if it can't mine empty blocks, it's not a tx that is the problem

yea so that doesn't sound like a tx that is causing it

[22-Oct-18 08:54 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe the error message is a catch all, somethings they arent to be trusted literally


[22-Oct-18 08:54 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`daemon reject the block, bcz it can't decode it`
I can't see how that's the issue when he says there's nothing in daemon debug


[22-Oct-18 08:54 AM] jl777c#5810
most likely is that mempool accepts it, so it is mined into a block and then fails validation


[22-Oct-18 08:55 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`Block notification via p2p`


[22-Oct-18 08:55 AM] Decker#3767
now we have a blockhex ... and we can put any debug printouts in daemon to find the issue. just use `submitblock` with this `blockhex` ...

btw, may be this will useful, to print hex block simply edit pool.js with this:

   ` function SubmitBlock(blockHex, callback) {
        var rpcCommand, rpcArgs;
        if (options.hasSubmitMethod) {
            rpcCommand = 'submitblock';
            rpcArgs = [blockHex];
        } else {
            rpcCommand = 'getblocktemplate';
            rpcArgs = [{
                'mode': 'submit',
                'data': blockHex
            }];
        }
        emitLog('Block hex : ' + blockHex);  // add this line
        _this.daemon.cmd(rpcCommand,
            rpcArgs,

[22-Oct-18 10:39 AM] Decker#3767
i'm modified a pool to include in block only 5 txes (4 txes + 1 coinbase) from mempool, to get short hex block to analyse. example of produced block:
https://gist.github.com/DeckerSU/aa80df1719c0eac0ee5d5e9fc256a1ea
pool software counts that daemon accept this block, but in real - this block don't appears on network. when i tried to submit this block manually again - daemon returns "duplicate-invalid" ... that means that block already known to daemon and it's invalid.

seems, if we understand why daemon count this block as invalid - problem will be solved.

@jorian


[22-Oct-18 10:44 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
it's possible that 1 or more tx in the "clogged" mempool were already processed and the blocks were invalid because they contained a virtual ds buy trying to add it in a new block


[22-Oct-18 10:45 AM] jorian#4555
check for each txid in `getrawmempool` on house node whether it's confirmed already?


[22-Oct-18 10:47 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
yeah, because I rebooted my node and no longer have them (since they are not being rebraodcast) a few of the ones I scrolled back and picked at random have been confirmed and some haven't

that was my initial thought, but if so it has to be deep in old code based on my solo getting same issue


[22-Oct-18 11:15 AM] forkwitch#6080
If you only leave coinbase transation in it it will mine it. But why not with transaction.


[22-Oct-18 11:16 AM] Decker#3767
@jl777c seems all nomp based software affected ... if mempool have more than 0x7F (127) txes - every mined block will fail, bcz seems it have incorrect `varint` encoding. when chain is stalled earlier - we have more than 170 txes in mempool. but to be sure at 100% - i'll need to write some additional code and try to reproduce it.


[22-Oct-18 11:16 AM] jl777c#5810
that is horrible bug!


[22-Oct-18 11:16 AM] jl777c#5810
and why 127 and not 255


[22-Oct-18 11:16 AM] jl777c#5810
wrong on many levels


[22-Oct-18 11:17 AM] Decker#3767
need additional tests ... want to be sure that it's varint encoding related ...


[22-Oct-18 11:17 AM] jl777c#5810
then a short term fix is to limit to 100 tx per block?


[22-Oct-18 11:17 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
@Decker if that's so then it has to be a 127 limit **and** something else; I used this solo before with over 10k txes in mempool


[22-Oct-18 11:17 AM] Alright#0419
I feel like I've stratum mined blocks with >127 txs in them on other chains


[22-Oct-18 11:21 AM] Decker#3767
Still investigating ... i assume that for 2500 txes in mempool, for example, all will be ok ... because 2500 in hex is a 2 bytes - 0x9C4 (C409) ... but if txes count is in 128..255 - it will fail.


[22-Oct-18 11:21 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
hmm


[22-Oct-18 11:21 AM] jl777c#5810
they used a signed byte instead of unsigned byte, that would do that


[22-Oct-18 11:22 AM] Decker#3767
```        if (this.txCount <= 0x7f){
            var varInt = new Buffer(txCount, 'hex');
        }
        else if (this.txCount <= 0x7fff){
            var varInt = new Buffer.concat([Buffer('FD', 'hex'), new Buffer(txCount, 'hex')]);
        }
```

This part seems problem.


[22-Oct-18 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
it should be <= 0xff

For 2 bytes txcount - should be FDxxyy ... and in case of 176 txes in mempool we have FDB0 instead of FDB000 ...


[22-Oct-18 11:25 AM] Decker#3767
Remember, chain stuck at moment when we have 176 txes in mempool ...


[22-Oct-18 11:25 AM] jl777c#5810
so all nomps have this bug?


[22-Oct-18 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
seems amazing they never found it


[22-Oct-18 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
and PIRATE never had so many tx in a block to hit this


[22-Oct-18 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD has notary mining


[22-Oct-18 11:26 AM] ComputerGenie#7004

It is by logic the bug. Yes. Wrong byte encoding formats in the block hex. Typo or wrong calculation from zclassic nomp developer Yoshua. https://github.com/zone117x/node-stratum-pool/blob/master/lib/blockTemplate.js dont have this.

Fix for all nomp-based software:
```if (this.txCount <= 0x7f){
    var varInt = new Buffer(txCount, 'hex');
}
else if (this.txCount <= 0x7fff){
    if (txCount.length == 2) txCount = "00" + txCount;
    var varInt = new Buffer.concat([Buffer('FD', 'hex'), util.reverseBuffer(new Buffer(txCount, 'hex'))]);
}
```
I save the logic of 0x7f and 0x7fff ... don't know why devs use "signed" checking here (may be compare with 0x80 in nodeJS cause problems), so, examples:

```this.txCount = 15, varInt = 0f
this.txCount = 127, varInt = 7f
this.txCount = 128, varInt = fd8000
this.txCount = 256, varInt = fd0001
this.txCount = 777, varInt = fd0903```

[22-Oct-18 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
two players cannot dice against each other, short of creating their own plan


[22-Oct-18 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
but it is still trustless even if the dealer node is involved


[22-Oct-18 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
since the entropy is revealed not once per day, but for every bet


[22-Oct-18 12:40 PM] forkwitch#6080

[22-Oct-18 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
if the dealer node doesnt run, they forfeit


[22-Oct-18 12:40 PM] Alright#0419
trust is in dealer node continually running

yea and kill the chain's emissions


[22-Oct-18 12:41 PM] jl777c#5810
making the dealier node forfeit makes it trustless


[22-Oct-18 12:41 PM] Alright#0419
dealer node goes down, anyone can take any amount from the contract


[22-Oct-18 12:41 PM] Alright#0419

[22-Oct-18 12:43 PM] Alright#0419
there is only one house with this chain concept

[22-Oct-18 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
it could have had 64 different dice plans


[22-Oct-18 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
it is what it is and if the dealer node goes down for prolonged period, people get free money


[22-Oct-18 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
i highly suggest to run redundant nodes for the dealer node


[22-Oct-18 12:44 PM] Alright#0419

I think it worth looking into a way where the dealer could respond with "sorry, can't"

[22-Oct-18 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
if each bet takes minutes, nobody would use it


[22-Oct-18 12:49 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe there is a way to use homomorphic encryption to be able to have the blockchain sign tx and run the dealer node, but it is beyond my expertise

it's undeniably a single point of failure, that is my entire point

[22-Oct-18 12:51 PM] jl777c#5810
no!


[22-Oct-18 12:51 PM] jl777c#5810
miner can cheat


[22-Oct-18 12:51 PM] Alright#0419
then you can throw some txs in the mempool, if they were confirmed, you can be sure miner didn't cheat it


[22-Oct-18 12:52 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
_is off to do things, but leaving solo pool and 2M running for now_


[22-Oct-18 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
wrong


[22-Oct-18 12:53 PM] jl777c#5810
miner puts all tx in the mempool and then adds an extra one to grind the desired entropy


[22-Oct-18 12:53 PM] Alright#0419
Ah understood


[22-Oct-18 12:53 PM] jl777c#5810
also, mempool isnt consensus safe to rely on


[22-Oct-18 12:53 PM] jl777c#5810
so it will be very tricky to punish a mempool violator without splitting the chain


[22-Oct-18 12:54 PM] jl777c#5810
i got lucky with my 51% design in that it could be placed right at the moment the dealer determines win/loss + refund


[22-Oct-18 12:54 PM] jl777c#5810
it is very tricky stuff, you need to think of all possible attacks

we could publish the dealer privkey

then it would be decentralised

not familiar with other dice blockchains if any. most seem to do a daily reveal of entropy secret, but that isnt trustless as bets are resolved and you need to trust the house will reveal the entropy

[22-Oct-18 01:15 PM] Alright#0419
maybe we could base entropy on oracles? Have N number of nodes submitting random stuff every single block, combine them, instead of dealer providing hash of entropy, dealer only provides which order to take the oracles in


[22-Oct-18 01:16 PM] Alright#0419
the data submitted could be some arbitrary data feed that no one would likely be able to influence


[22-Oct-18 01:16 PM] Alright#0419
say some data taken from twitter usage or something like that


[22-Oct-18 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
yes oraclizing random data is a fine idea


[22-Oct-18 01:17 PM] Alright#0419
or make all nodes have to agree on that entropy


[22-Oct-18 01:17 PM] jl777c#5810
when i wrote dice CC, oracles CC didnt exist


[22-Oct-18 01:17 PM] Alright#0419
if 15/16 nodes say "this is the latest" and one is disagreeing, throw it out

yes the issue becomes latency


[22-Oct-18 01:18 PM] jl777c#5810
you could generate a hash chain from a seed but then the ordering of tx determines the RNG

[22-Oct-18 01:19 PM] Alright#0419
instead of a centralized person saying "this is the order", could we take something like merkle root or block hash and make it determine order? The attacker would have to submit data that will influence the entropy and also mine the block


[22-Oct-18 01:21 PM] jl777c#5810
CHIPS solves the realtime multicomputation of RNG

`should push users towards bdex instead of OTC`
*after* you fix it so that coins can be altered **before** logging in

I use barterdex v0.8.8rc

`after you fix it so that coins can be altered before logging in` still not fixed?

although bdex GUI is great once you understand how it's actually interacting with the mm


[22-Oct-18 02:22 PM] Alright#0419
not so great if you're just pressing buttons hoping they'll do something


[22-Oct-18 02:22 PM] SHossain#0007
@Flexatron that is a very old version of GUI

[22-Oct-18 02:28 PM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie it's more like "imagine a couple web devs that didn't understand BTC, ZEC or KMD at all made a fork of KMD"


[22-Oct-18 02:29 PM] Alright#0419
then their community was conditioned to hassle people asking technical questions

occasionally check in on it, but progress is rarely made other than on their CEX


[22-Oct-18 02:35 PM] Alright#0419
it's a "community coin", but it's only "unique"(not unique) feature is a for-profit CEX

I watch his vids when I'm bored and keep a running count of how many times he says "uhhh" and "ehhhm"; thinking about turning it into a drinking game to see if anyone in the world can stay sober if they do a shot each time he says one

you have to understand what size UTXOs you need

for a buy order as well?


[22-Oct-18 02:52 PM] Flexatron#8809

[22-Oct-18 02:53 PM] Alright#0419
for alice side(buyer), you need UTXOs in ratio of 1(+txfee) and >1/777(+txfee)


[22-Oct-18 02:53 PM] And1#6578
hi what is the current price to buy?


[22-Oct-18 02:53 PM] jorian#4555
0.9


[22-Oct-18 02:53 PM] Alright#0419
meaning if you wanted to trade 1 KMD, you need a utxo of at least 1.0001 and >1/777 KMD utxo


[22-Oct-18 02:53 PM] Alright#0419
can be something like 10x the size you want to trade


[22-Oct-18 02:53 PM] jorian#4555

I'm just comparing the profits. For example, during investigating pools bug i spent some BTC on hashrate and as a result have some KMDICE. But i have much more from using dice. That's what i mean.

`OTC should be moved outside of the pirate sub if it is expanding beyond just pirate trades`
If only there were some channel called something like #📈┃talk-trading ..... 🤔


[22-Oct-18 06:08 PM] bishop#9773
so then I guess we can get rid of OTC then :eyeroll:


[22-Oct-18 06:09 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
#deleted-channel is a sub of PIRATE because it's a PIRATE channel, just like #deleted-channel or #deleted-channel


[22-Oct-18 06:09 PM] bishop#9773
and how does that change anything I said initially


[22-Oct-18 06:10 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
the fact that what you said initially ignores that #📈┃talk-trading exists


[22-Oct-18 06:10 PM] bishop#9773
then otc is redundant


[22-Oct-18 06:10 PM] ComputerGenie#7004

#deleted-channel is PIRATE specific, #📈┃talk-trading is not

it makes more sense to consolidate into one channel

exactly....


[22-Oct-18 06:16 PM] bishop#9773
so broad otc trades should be consolidating in their own otc-related channel to leave the market and day trading discussion to the trading channel


[22-Oct-18 06:16 PM] bishop#9773
and since otc only exists in pirate, it makes more sense to bring it out of pirate if it is expanding beyond pirate pairs

pools can set their own "min conf" on top of chain maturity too (default is usually 10)

resynced both nodes and they went to the longer chain

I guess my old Knomp must have mined an invalid block and the chain stopped.

I should probably remove all those small AC, as someone can easily just drrive by on them with high hash rate and they will stall... 🤔

MGNX is 90% PoS and they ahve a second coin with masternodes


[22-Oct-18 11:01 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Seems like an attack vector, high hashrate stalling that is


[22-Oct-18 11:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
has been that way for a long time...


[22-Oct-18 11:01 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Because of the ondemand?


[22-Oct-18 11:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
using a PoS percentage basically stops it being possible,... even a 10% PoS will force the diff higher than ZEC if someone hash attacks it


[22-Oct-18 11:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
I also did some work on staked, where I made a chain, that enforces ondemand as a consensus rule pretty much, although if someone spent he time, they cna still make a stratum that works with them.


[22-Oct-18 11:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
make the coinbase all weird... and stratum just fails on it ... so can only mine with KMD daemons built in ondemand miner

We have already deplayed too long, and decided to launch the main chain without its cluster before 100 new AC launch and there is no hash power left 🤣

mining reward is 50 PoS 50PoW


[23-Oct-18 01:38 AM] Deleted User#0000
on main chain... the rest are probably mined by notaries or chain creator ( a percentage of STAKED BR will go to notaries)


[23-Oct-18 01:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
so hash rate will be concentrated on 1 chain, but all chains are protected

you can also launch the chain, not in the fungible cluster and just burn staked to launch it


[23-Oct-18 01:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
locking the staked into that chain forever

[23-Oct-18 01:44 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
So like how PAX was,  you burn some coin,  receive proportional amount of other coin on the other chain.

Burn protocol they called it

[23-Oct-18 01:45 AM] Deleted User#0000
yes, you burn coins, then they are created on the other chain.... atm there has been a 2-7% chance that the import TX is invalid ad the coins are lost ... thats unacceptable.

Is it though 😉

seems a better idea to just identify why it doesnt work and fix it .. like I did with the notarisations on notary nodes.

Will know in 2 days time, if I have identified a way to make the burn procol work... it seems that by simply slowing it down a lot, it becomes much more realiable.

Updated. Now it includes fetch-params.cmd to auto download ZCashParams. https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/b863ad3b832c393e7d4d6dc67eb2e5e532d99240daef62d30456afdfaabd95e9/detection

Miss it in first release. Thx @jorian  .

what is current hashrate ?


[23-Oct-18 04:15 AM] forkwitch#6080
WTS KMDICE at 1 KMD


[23-Oct-18 04:15 AM] forkwitch#6080
About 20 MSol @122212yu.


[23-Oct-18 04:15 AM] siu#3920
Thanks a bunch, decker!


[23-Oct-18 04:16 AM] 122212yu#1298
Thank you @forkwitch


[23-Oct-18 04:16 AM] 122212yu#1298
so 1Msol give around 15000 KMDICE in 24 h...


[23-Oct-18 04:17 AM] 122212yu#1298
or not


[23-Oct-18 04:18 AM] forkwitch#6080
25 KMDICE * 1440 blocks = 36,000 KMDICE per 24h for all network.


[23-Oct-18 04:18 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
1Msol will give you what 1Msol gives you


[23-Oct-18 04:19 AM] Decker#3767
@ComputerGenie Ideal logic )) If you have 1 MSol - you have 1 MSol ))


[23-Oct-18 04:20 AM] forkwitch#6080
With 10% you maybe make 3,600 KMDICE if you are 100% lucky with your share.


[23-Oct-18 04:21 AM] forkwitch#6080
Yes right, this is why i say 10% absolute measure , not Sol relative measure.

[23-Oct-18 04:21 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
@Decker my point was that blanket statements are bad and net sols fluctuate and some moron might decide to add 40M and change the answer


[23-Oct-18 04:23 AM] forkwitch#6080
Some do not understand that they waste the hashes. Less hashes will have about same blocks for them. I saw one can save 20 to  50% costs.


[23-Oct-18 04:23 AM] forkwitch#6080
Waste of $ and pollution.

@forkwitch exactly, there's a delicate balance to increasing your share of the network vs self-defeating addition to where you're only increasing teh diff against yourself


[23-Oct-18 04:25 AM] ComputerGenie#7004

[23-Oct-18 04:25 AM] forkwitch#6080
Why they do it then? I can not understand.


[23-Oct-18 04:26 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`Why they do it then? `
Because most people's education of all things mining is less than 10% of what mining is, means, and entails

[23-Oct-18 05:18 AM] Flexatron#8809
@Decker  sir, there is a typo in how-to-play-en.txt


[23-Oct-18 05:18 AM] Flexatron#8809
the left quote in step 4 hugging the pubkey is outside


[23-Oct-18 05:20 AM] Flexatron#8809
I get this when running with the pubkey btw:
Error: There is no RPC client functionality in komodod. Use the komodo-cli utility instead.


[23-Oct-18 05:21 AM] Oszy#5734
you dont even need the quotes. oh wait, you do when .cmd


[23-Oct-18 05:21 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`Error: There is no RPC client functionality in komodod. Use the komodo-cli utility instead.` usually means you left off a `-`


[23-Oct-18 05:21 AM] Decker#3767
You can just add `-pubkey=your_pubkey` directly in `kmdice.cmd` ...


[23-Oct-18 05:22 AM] Oszy#5734
but you can include -pubkey in the cmd as well.


[23-Oct-18 05:22 AM] Flexatron#8809
nvm it was on purpose


[23-Oct-18 05:22 AM] Flexatron#8809
now seems to work


[23-Oct-18 05:22 AM] Decker#3767
`kmdice-cli` is a temporary solution until we don't have a GUI. as i know - 2 peoples work on GUI right now.


[23-Oct-18 05:23 AM] Decker#3767
so, we should have 2 different GUIs ...


[23-Oct-18 05:24 AM] siu#3920

[23-Oct-18 04:38 PM] Llama#1330
how split up utxo


[23-Oct-18 04:40 PM] c2k#4915
in barterdex click exchange on the coin you want to manage your utxo's


[23-Oct-18 04:41 PM] c2k#4915
then in the par on the top left click "inventory"


[23-Oct-18 04:41 PM] c2k#4915
you should see your utxo's on the lower half of the screen


[23-Oct-18 04:41 PM] c2k#4915
if you ahve 1 utxo then you want to select "make inventory" in the center which will split your balance into the lots shown


[23-Oct-18 04:42 PM] Llama#1330
i have more than 100 utxo


[23-Oct-18 04:43 PM] Llama#1330
@c2k


[23-Oct-18 04:45 PM] c2k#4915
im not an expert on utxo's but i think you want your utxo sizes to fairly match the utxo sizes of the other side of the trade


[23-Oct-18 04:45 PM] c2k#4915
so if your selling you want your utxo sizes to be similar sizes to the buyers in bdex


[23-Oct-18 04:45 PM] c2k#4915
if you send the balance to yourself you will get 1 utxo of your size


[23-Oct-18 04:45 PM] c2k#4915
then you can re-split

[23-Oct-18 05:07 PM] Llama#1330
i have like 90


[23-Oct-18 05:07 PM] c2k#4915
smaller for trading kmdice on bdex ...like what size do you think is optimal?


[23-Oct-18 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
why not just standardize on the trading utxo size?


[23-Oct-18 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
say 100 KMDICE utxo


[23-Oct-18 05:08 PM] jl777c#5810
then make 100 and 115 sized utxos for the bobs


[23-Oct-18 05:12 PM] siu#3920
Please. Make 1 and 5 utxos too hehe

[24-Oct-18 01:03 AM] Flexatron#8809
The first dice winning strategy is the *Martingale*, which is easy to understand and learn, as this is one of the most popular strategies for dice. The first thing you need to do is to bet a single unit and stick with it until you lose. And when you lose, double your wager. Once you get a win, you go back to your original wager. Doing this heightens your chance of getting your losses back.

One more dice winning strategy that is similar to Martingale is the *D’Alembert*. The only difference is that you only increase your bet amount by x1 when you lose on a roll and decrease it by one when you win.

Another tactic that you can use in your Bitcoin dice game is the *Paroli*. In this strategy, you start with the bet of your choice. When you win on that bet, you can double your next bet until either you lose on the next bet or you are in a winning streak. When either of the two happens, you can rest your bet amount. This is less risky than Martingale and D’Alembert, since the aim of this strategy is to take advantage of the lucky streaks.


[24-Oct-18 01:05 AM] Oszy#5734
@Flexatron  I have simulated Martingale and Fibonacci over 10000 turns each multiple times, the chances that you are actually winning a little bit after 10000 turns are very slim

ahh fetchcoinsdb did the trick either way.


[24-Oct-18 03:52 AM] Decker#3767
@jl777c i found some of my nodes stucked tonight, also, i saw following case many times:
1. making a bet
2. CCduration no hashBlock for txid <txid> appears in komodod output (dicestatus returns "bet still pending")
3. after that it can stuck at block on which we make a bet.


[24-Oct-18 03:57 AM] jl777c#5810
can you isolate the cause? no hashBlock for txid means it somehow does not know what block the txid is in...


[24-Oct-18 03:57 AM] jl777c#5810
it could well be related to gettransaction not working for mempool tx


[24-Oct-18 03:57 AM] jl777c#5810
what branch are you on?


[24-Oct-18 03:57 AM] Decker#3767
`dev`


[24-Oct-18 03:59 AM] Decker#3767
i'm always use the following steps:
```
rawtx=$(./komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE dicebet $name $fundingtxid $amount $odds | jq -r .hex)
txid=$(./komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE sendrawtransaction $rawtx)
sleep 5
./komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE dicestatus $name $fundingtxid $txid```

and some times it runs perfect, and sometimes produce `CCduration no hashBlock for txid <txid>` after sendrawtransaction.


[24-Oct-18 04:00 AM] Decker#3767
no other changes, always same steps ... but sometimes it's ok, and sometimes after sendrawtx i get "no hashBlock for txid".


[24-Oct-18 04:01 AM] Decker#3767
except this thing, all other - seems stable.


[24-Oct-18 04:02 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, dev branch doesnt have the gettransaction problem, this seems some timing issue?


[24-Oct-18 04:02 AM] jl777c#5810
we need a way to avoid this condition or some way to fix this condition


[24-Oct-18 04:04 AM] CrisF#3405

[24-Oct-18 04:12 AM] siu#3920
@jl777c i had that same issue decker describes yesterday on dev branch


[24-Oct-18 04:13 AM] siu#3920
I thought it had to do we me trying to start a swap at the same time


[24-Oct-18 04:14 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, that is one theory, but if decker gets it without mm, it could just be some local tx activity pattern that triggers it


[24-Oct-18 04:14 AM] jl777c#5810
clearly this is a bad bug, needs to be isolated and fixed


[24-Oct-18 04:16 AM] CrisF#3405

Currently, from a user view it seems to sit there and be unresponsive (because it can't bet at that point in time)

how many entropy tx you had?


[24-Oct-18 08:11 AM] siu#3920
it says 3 here


[24-Oct-18 08:11 AM] SHossain#0007
you need to keep making them. as users play they get consumed

3 is nothing 😃

entropy tx isn't one use, doesn't dicefinish from dealer node create a new one?


[24-Oct-18 08:14 AM] SHossain#0007
entropy tx number reduces as users play


[24-Oct-18 08:14 AM] SHossain#0007
at least what i have seen during testing period

does dicefinish make another entropy utxo

doesnt matter if its entropy or 0 balance

If you have no local funds, then your balance is 0 not > 0

Entropy txs being sent


[24-Oct-18 09:04 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe like notaries, monitor entropy utxo and issue them if not enough


[24-Oct-18 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
i saw 400+ bets in one block, so that used up a lot of entropy until it confirmed


[24-Oct-18 09:05 AM] jorian#4555
so entropy txes do not get back?


[24-Oct-18 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810
well in most paths they should...


[24-Oct-18 09:08 AM] jl777c#5810
but if the dealer node doesnt finish, it wont come back


[24-Oct-18 09:08 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe there are other code paths where it doesnt


[24-Oct-18 09:08 AM] jl777c#5810
when i tested it, all cases the entropy tx came back


[24-Oct-18 09:08 AM] jl777c#5810
but i did notice that entropy tx do get eaten


[24-Oct-18 09:08 AM] jl777c#5810
it could simply be when the dealer node does a finish, it needs utxo for txfee and that eats an entropy tx


[24-Oct-18 09:11 AM] siu#3920
did we break it again?

Hi Chmex,
I only add blockchain that are already listed on coinmarketcap. 
I can't find yours. 
What is KMDICE, is it a sidechain to Komodo ?


[24-Oct-18 10:51 AM] SHossain#0007
Tell them this is an independent chain

[24-Oct-18 10:58 AM] CHMEX#0686
Hi Estefan,
Thank you for your swift feedback.
It is an independent chain but of course people can also call it sidechain does not really matter. It currently has 15msol which is approx 1BTC per day spent on hash only KMD has 21msols. Yes it's not on Coinmarketcap yet.
It would be great if you can list it anyways it's not some Joke Coin, Meme Coin or whatever they call it. It's secured by KMD / BTC and lots of electricity used.

if gui show 63 - your daemon thinks that is 63 ...

That you're posting a sale offer that no one is buying does not a "market price" make

[24-Oct-18 03:27 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
No one is paying you the 61.6 cents you're asking for, which means 61.6 cents is *not* the "market price"

New version of Windows KMDICE remote GUI available. Small interface improvements.
https://www.virustotal.com/#/file/1a982d48b6a57d0af5cb5fce71e4c36b6b319847e72a5fc4a4f8f1a0e5d18aca/detection

No, it's GUI for daemon.


[24-Oct-18 06:01 PM] Llama#1330
@yh you need to download https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/releases/download/multios-201810011016-71fc062/komodo_win64_master.zip if you are on windows.


[24-Oct-18 06:01 PM] yh#8735
@Llama ok tq


[24-Oct-18 06:02 PM] Llama#1330
then you open a command prompt and navigate to the folder with cd/(filepath). the last part should be win64.


[24-Oct-18 06:02 PM] Llama#1330
and then paste this in ```komodod.exe -ac_name=KMDICE -ac_supply=10500000 -ac_reward=2500000000 -ac_halving=210000 -ac_cc=2 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -addnode=144.76.217.232```


[24-Oct-18 06:02 PM] Llama#1330
and when that is completely done, open another command prompt and type this in:


[24-Oct-18 06:03 PM] Llama#1330
`komodo-cli.exe -ac_name=KMDICE importprivkey UXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX` replace `UXXX `with your privkey


[24-Oct-18 06:03 PM] Llama#1330
and it should return your KMD address.


[24-Oct-18 06:04 PM] Llama#1330
type this in to the 2nd command prompt to see info about your wallet and such: `komodo-cli.exe -ac_name=KMDICE getinfo`

@hammy502 it's not yet added to Agama. But actually - you don't need Agama to mine KMDICE. You can just use any of your R-addresses from which you have privkey, or you can mine it on R-address related to your Agama's passphrase (it's same as having privkey).

are we still seeing people getting on a fork?

blocks seem to be regular and I dont hear complaints

[25-Oct-18 08:25 AM] SHossain#0007
i have not seen fork since then


[25-Oct-18 08:26 AM] SHossain#0007
all nodes running fine

[25-Oct-18 08:32 AM] jl777c#5810
the level of activity shows why it is good to have a dedicated chain for a single dapp. if this was on KMD, and it keeps growing like it is, it would start bogging KMD down at some point. As it is, we might need to go to a KMDICE cluster

[25-Oct-18 08:37 AM] jl777c#5810
it could be there are not enough entropy tx, i see mempool go to about 30 and then stop


[25-Oct-18 08:37 AM] jl777c#5810
@siu @jorian can you add another 100 entropy tx


[25-Oct-18 08:39 AM] siu#3920
@jl777c no, no forks, but i think that the issue was when you tried to do too many bets from your node when there are no entropy txs


[25-Oct-18 08:40 AM] siu#3920
jorian will setup more entropy in about an hour


[25-Oct-18 08:40 AM] siu#3920
he is out of his house


[25-Oct-18 08:41 AM] siu#3920
but yeah, it already being evident why the setup was an issue :/


[25-Oct-18 08:41 AM] siu#3920
we needed to break those 10million in thousands of entropy utxo


[25-Oct-18 08:44 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe a cron task to make a few entropy tx is needed

[25-Oct-18 12:17 PM] siu#3920
It seems like the cc address takes some time to process the entropy txs and that makes the chain get stuck since txs keep piling up in mempool

well, it might help if I weren't the only one mining the chain 😛

yes, it does seem that the forkwitch pool isnt updated properly

for the time being if the chain is stalled, look at `getmempoolinfo` if it's >128 but <256, make it >256

[25-Oct-18 12:54 PM] Alright#0419
should unstick the pool if it receives them in mempool


[25-Oct-18 12:55 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
`is there just one pool?`
from the looks of the last 2-3 hrs, my solo pool is either all there is or there's no miners at any of the other pools

[25-Oct-18 12:58 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
well, then there's definitely issues with his pool


[25-Oct-18 12:59 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
I'm only running ~400k on it


[25-Oct-18 01:00 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
and I've gotten all 13 of the blocks in the last 2.5 hrs


[25-Oct-18 01:01 PM] jl777c#5810
definitely seems like a forkwitch pool problem


[25-Oct-18 01:01 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
given that he had 6-8M when I started, yes


[25-Oct-18 01:04 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
dunno if joker is doing more or finally broadcasting, but mempool is finally propigating


[25-Oct-18 01:04 PM] jorian#4555
block found, 300 txns


[25-Oct-18 01:04 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
and that


[25-Oct-18 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
and the theory is that now it should become normal


[25-Oct-18 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
unless there are still more than 128 in mempool


[25-Oct-18 01:05 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
```$ komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE getmempoolinfo
{
  "size": 124```


[25-Oct-18 01:07 PM] jorian#4555
relatively empty blocks are now mined


[25-Oct-18 01:07 PM] wookie#7663
is kmdice in the agama .43b announced today?


[25-Oct-18 01:07 PM] jorian#4555
yes


[25-Oct-18 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
we need more pools, and with the pool bug fixed


[25-Oct-18 01:07 PM] jorian#4555
it happens when i enable my entropy creator


[25-Oct-18 01:07 PM] jorian#4555
i'll do a cronjob


[25-Oct-18 01:08 PM] jorian#4555
with  more time inbetween


[25-Oct-18 01:08 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
`relatively empty blocks are now mined`
lack of propigation, like I had earlier, I'd bet
```$ komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE getmempoolinfo
{

  "bytes": 79950,

it seems the actual capacity is quite limited until this is fixed

where did he say that


[25-Oct-18 01:13 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
somewhere back where he posted screenshots

[25-Oct-18 01:41 PM] Alright#0419
yea... about that...


[25-Oct-18 01:42 PM] Alright#0419
if two txs spend the same input, which one does a miner mine


[25-Oct-18 01:42 PM] Alright#0419
the first one or the one with higher tx fee?


[25-Oct-18 01:45 PM] wookie#7663
i'm not sure if this matters. I ran KMDice from cli about a week ago, then shut down the wallet. I've been mining KMDice on/off since. I just now downloaded the 43b agama wallet. I'm just now syncing the KMDice native wallet. I'm seeing that all the mining rewards are coming in dated as right now, instead of the dates that I mined them.
I also seem to be stuck on block 9172...


[25-Oct-18 01:45 PM] Alright#0419
maybe solution is add a txfee option to dicebet


[25-Oct-18 01:45 PM] Alright#0419
and just out bidding spammers on the txfee


[25-Oct-18 01:46 PM] Alright#0419
you're on a fork


[25-Oct-18 01:47 PM] wookie#7663
🤦


[25-Oct-18 01:47 PM] Alright#0419
not sure why it's forked, but I keep seeing messages in debug.log about that chain


[25-Oct-18 01:48 PM] wookie#7663
hmmm, should I just (save wallet) delete blocks and reindex?


[25-Oct-18 01:54 PM] Alright#0419
delete blocks and chainstate dirs and resync


[25-Oct-18 01:54 PM] siu#3920
I think the house node needs to become a high capacity server too


[25-Oct-18 01:54 PM] Alright#0419
stop the daemon first


[25-Oct-18 02:02 PM] Oszy#5734
I resynced now, getting bet pending result


[25-Oct-18 02:05 PM] Alright#0419
stopping my spam script, bets will start working again in a minute

[25-Oct-18 02:15 PM] siu#3920
Oh well


[25-Oct-18 02:15 PM] siu#3920
We will need to fix this


[25-Oct-18 02:20 PM] siu#3920
So you cant actually steal the funds. But you can spam the house


[25-Oct-18 02:24 PM] Alright#0419
prevents everyone from betting


[25-Oct-18 02:24 PM] Alright#0419
for cheap


[25-Oct-18 02:24 PM] siu#3920
So we need a kiddie pool


[25-Oct-18 02:24 PM] siu#3920
I mean another plan for lower size bets


[25-Oct-18 02:25 PM] siu#3920
But anyway. The best way to do this is by having just one pool for everyone


[25-Oct-18 02:26 PM] Alright#0419
try to figure out the cost of it at different minbets values


[25-Oct-18 02:26 PM] Alright#0419
and make it cost more than it's worth doing


[25-Oct-18 02:27 PM] Alright#0419
what I don't quite understand is why the script was able to bet so many times here


[25-Oct-18 02:27 PM] Alright#0419
http://kmdice.explorer.dexstats.info/block/000000027da0d1d87acda1098b7fda96f32c68d90c52e2da685fbc6739974ac0


[25-Oct-18 02:27 PM] Alright#0419
then the following blocks there's only a couple utxos


[25-Oct-18 02:27 PM] Alright#0419
how long does a dicebet lock a utxo for?


[25-Oct-18 02:28 PM] Alright#0419
until dicefinish?


[25-Oct-18 02:32 PM] siu#3920
It may have been related to doing more entropy tx at the same time as your script was running


[25-Oct-18 02:32 PM] Alright#0419
well yes, I used them up immediately


[25-Oct-18 02:33 PM] Alright#0419
but they should be reusable after dicefinish is called on those bets


[25-Oct-18 02:33 PM] siu#3920
@jorian


[25-Oct-18 02:33 PM] Alright#0419
so my question is, where are the entropy utxos in the next block coming from?


[25-Oct-18 02:34 PM] Alright#0419
or the block after or after that


[25-Oct-18 02:34 PM] Alright#0419
if dicefinish didn't happen yet, how are there more utxos available once those ones confirmed?


[25-Oct-18 02:40 PM] siu#3920
We might have to get some more higher size entropy utxos


[25-Oct-18 02:40 PM] siu#3920
Not sure


[25-Oct-18 02:41 PM] Alright#0419
what size are you doing?


[25-Oct-18 02:42 PM] Alright#0419
I think .0001 may only get used once


[25-Oct-18 02:42 PM] Alright#0419
the change of it would be reused each time, but with .0001 I think there is no change


[25-Oct-18 03:15 PM] Llama#1330
is mining working again?


[25-Oct-18 03:16 PM] Alright#0419
@Llama it will until there are 129-255 txs in the mempool or until @forkwitch updates his pool


[25-Oct-18 03:16 PM] Llama#1330
oh rip


[25-Oct-18 03:16 PM] Llama#1330
i guess ill stop then


[25-Oct-18 03:17 PM] Llama#1330
is there another pool?


[25-Oct-18 03:17 PM] Alright#0419
solo mining would be fine


[25-Oct-18 03:17 PM] Alright#0419
but forkswitch's pool will stall when there's between 129 and 255 txs in it's mempool

@Deleted User part of the problem is that the dameon is only putting a small amount of txes in the template, so the mempool isn't getting cleaned out


[25-Oct-18 06:26 PM] Decker#3767
@ComputerGenie yep ... you are right, mempool size != blocktemplate txes size ... that's the part of problem.

@memo Any chain in the Komodo ecosystem that uses an "R" address can be used across all of them that do
If you can't use a commandline wallet, you can just use any KMD address that you have the privkey for

@jorian @siu using entropy tx of 0.0001 is likely requiring the constant making of entropy tx as it gets used up in one txfee
maybe make entropy tx of 0.01 or even 0.1 ?

Found interesting thing. Yesterday, when somebody broadcast 200+ bet txes they exists in mempool, but appears in blocktemplate with a big delay:
```komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE getrawmempool | jq length
192
komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE getblocktemplate | jq '.transactions | length'
8```
192 txes in mempool, but in blocktemplate only 8 ...
But now, when i'm sent ~1500 normal txes it appears in mempool and blocktemplate immediatily, as a result all 1500 txes included in last 2 blocks:

Normal txes - mean not bet, just send funds from one address to another.

try the following:
1. bet 1 
2. if lose -> bet 2
3. if lose -> bet 4 
...
repeat until win ...

15x red _IS_ possible -  so you end up betting 2**15 your initial bet


[26-Oct-18 04:29 AM] LocoMB#8593
dunno about casino databses- but should be possible to verify if 15x RED has been seen somewhere

hahaha - ouch:
There are no exceptions that the same color appeared more than 20 times in a row in practice. The record was registered in 1943, when red color came up 32 times in a row! The probability of such event in French Roulette is (18/37)32 = 0.000000000096886885 with the corresponding odds 10,321,314,387:1.

TBH, and that is a personal idea / thought, I believe that if it is clearly stated that in case of a chain restart, because atm it is used for testing, if ever the chain get stuck, and it is announced people are "safe" and holding will live even on a new chain just using a snapshot, it would create value and trust on the coin


[26-Oct-18 04:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
would drag more outsiders to take the bet and start investing / playing

yeah but the fear of a chain restart may stop people from thinking : ok, I know coins won't be wiped out


[26-Oct-18 04:42 AM] siu#3920
But yeah, we need to make it clear that even of somday the chain need to be forked into a new one, all funds will be airdropped to kmdice holders

We did make this chain with the intent for it to be public from start. As in serious... well, its a dice game and we dont have a financial gain from it, its mostly a community chain. So i dont think we will go serious with this as in creating business models and such. That will be in the hands of the community

[26-Oct-18 06:24 AM] jl777c#5810
@Decker do you think you can isolate why a node goes on a fork with lots of bets all at once?


[26-Oct-18 06:24 AM] jl777c#5810
the code isnt that complex, there must be a bug in the validation code under lots of load


[26-Oct-18 06:25 AM] jl777c#5810
or could be due to two blocks having the same timestamp


[26-Oct-18 06:25 AM] jl777c#5810
or gremlins


[26-Oct-18 06:26 AM] jl777c#5810
and the not finding the tx in the mempool is another clue


[26-Oct-18 06:27 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
@jl777c is there a way to isolate when `cant find dice input` is a result of user UTXOs vs the contract being locked up?
as it is now, the return is the same for both


[26-Oct-18 06:27 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
the stdout shows the difference but not the rpc reply


[26-Oct-18 06:30 AM] benohanlon#7045
@memo close it down and reopen with KMD in native mode. Then active coin and choose native for KMDICE. It'll be defaulting to lite so make sure you choose natiive.

yeah, that was my workaround, but it adds a ton of overhead (comparatively speaking, when compared to the rpc response having more detail)


[26-Oct-18 07:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yes that helps, but the low level design of the CC_EVAL function means that it cannt send the data to JSON return in its current form.


[26-Oct-18 07:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
CC_EVAL either returns a txid or ""


[26-Oct-18 07:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
and it pushes the reason for the fail to stderr


[26-Oct-18 07:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
Maybe there is a way to push it via another path, so it can be accessed by the RPC return fucntion


[26-Oct-18 07:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
The RPC could maybe check as many contitions as possible before trying CC_EVAL ?


[26-Oct-18 07:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
and onyl very edge cases then return an ambigious error

that seems the easiest way, but adds a LOT of code overhead inside the daemon

I found using the C++ code inisde the daemon to sort data and return is liek 100x faster than caling multiple RPCs though

and sorting / filtering via dAPP


[26-Oct-18 07:21 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`I found using the C++ code inisde the daemon to sort data and return is liek 100x faster than caling multiple RPCs though`
right, which is why even though it 'adds a LOT of code overhead inside the daemon', it's still a better option than processing overhead client-side, imo

the fork thing is separate from the "lack of full blocks" as far as I can tell


[26-Oct-18 08:43 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
being me for a moment:
The fact that s/k/znomp exists and anyone can throw up a pool in 7 minutes sometimes creates its own issues in that pool ops don't "need" to know what they are doing
Just because we *can* throw up 100 pools doesn't mean that we have even one *stable* pool

these "fork" issues from what I have heard is that your own node loses sync with the mainchain, but no other node is affected


[26-Oct-18 11:30 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe this is disincentive for the spamming?


[26-Oct-18 11:30 AM] jl777c#5810
I think I know why getblocktemplate is not putting in all the tx from mempool


[26-Oct-18 11:31 AM] jl777c#5810
with many dicebets using mempool utxo, depending on the order you add tx to a block, it might not allow all the mempool tx to be mined. the issue is in miner.cpp where it creates a block. I think fixing that would make things a lot better as it would recycle bets that much better, but still eventually utxo will run out


[26-Oct-18 12:05 PM] Oszy#5734
i think it's something like that. when it didn't work i was always behind a few blocks

this seems to indicate some sort of mempool based consensus issue


[26-Oct-18 12:13 PM] siu#3920
yes, definitively something is up.


[26-Oct-18 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
yes


[26-Oct-18 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
we need this isolated and understood so we can fix it


[26-Oct-18 12:13 PM] siu#3920
It was working quite well all day... 99% of the bets went through smoothly


[26-Oct-18 12:14 PM] siu#3920
but suddenly i got a bet still pending and when i checked getinfo it was forked.


[26-Oct-18 12:15 PM] siu#3920
It could be that 2 bets select the same utxo in the house and when the first one confirms, the second one gets orphaned


[26-Oct-18 12:15 PM] siu#3920
?


[26-Oct-18 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
it could be it ends up in your mempool, but not in the real mempool that gets mined


[26-Oct-18 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
so your node thinks you did a bet, but really it didnt happen


[26-Oct-18 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, this feels like what is happening from the reported behavior


[26-Oct-18 12:18 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
`ok, so the behavior is making bets can cause a node to lose sync..`
It has to be a little more than *just* that; I've been running my autoplay off and on for 2 days and during "the big lock up" was the only time I experienced the fork


[26-Oct-18 12:19 PM] siu#3920
now i reindexed the chain and getting this all the time ```CCduration no hashBlock for txid 6b6f204b8c6e2a4b6a574704d20fbb129721d90821f575c05d71cd047f00c501
```


[26-Oct-18 12:19 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
👆🏼 that I still haven't figured out


[26-Oct-18 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
what i mean is that the mempool must be affecting the consensus. maybe it is simply due to being orphaned


[26-Oct-18 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
6b6f204b8c6e2a4b6a574704d20fbb129721d90821f575c05d71cd047f00c501

is not in the explorer


[26-Oct-18 12:20 PM] jl777c#5810
was orphaned


[26-Oct-18 12:20 PM] jl777c#5810
so if you clear that tx from the wallet, it should fix things


[26-Oct-18 12:20 PM] siu#3920
that would mean a resync?


[26-Oct-18 12:21 PM] jl777c#5810
i think there is a way to cancel a tx from wallet


[26-Oct-18 12:21 PM] jl777c#5810
via rpc call


[26-Oct-18 12:21 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
@jl777c it doesn't seem that mempool/consensus is even an issue with that as I get it even with same node as my pool

]
```


[26-Oct-18 12:21 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
if a consensus thing, then it has to be consensus ruleset


[26-Oct-18 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
there is the whole realtime mempool response aspect...


[26-Oct-18 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
i think the dicebet rpc needs to check for the bet being orphaned


[26-Oct-18 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
or dicestatus


[26-Oct-18 12:24 PM] jl777c#5810
I guess a new rpc needs to be made to delete an orphaned txid from the wallet, but I thought it did that automatically


[26-Oct-18 12:24 PM] siu#3920
`resendwallettransactions` solved it for me


[26-Oct-18 12:24 PM] siu#3920
no i can bet


[26-Oct-18 12:25 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
my halfassed workaround was to just self restart the script if pending was the result after 3x 5 second trys and a 90 second wait

0.1 less than three and one half


[26-Oct-18 02:11 PM] TonyL#3577
If you have an average odds of your bets 3.4  it assumes ~22,7% average wins
You have  17,7% so a little bit unlucky ☹

Small explanation of daemon printouts:
```modval 8668 vs 3333 - means that somebody bet with odds=2 and lose (player's number - 8668, house number - 3333)
modval 2293 vs 3333 - same, but win (player's number - 2293, house number - 3333)

odds=2 -> house number=3333
```

More odds you choose -> lower house number -> harder to win.


[27-Oct-18 07:11 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
*odds=2 -> player number=3333


[27-Oct-18 07:13 AM] Decker#3767
@ComputerGenie may be viceversa ... but meaninng is same: if first number in `modval` is lower that a second number - it's a win.

[27-Oct-18 07:16 AM] HenryChinaski#2919
And i suppose you have to use an specific wallet 🤔


[27-Oct-18 07:16 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
```JSON

[27-Oct-18 07:17 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
as far as wallet, the only "specific" is that it has to have funds

on barterdex. but it dont connect


[27-Oct-18 12:02 PM] SHossain#0007
@vogelfreund you will find using BarterDEX very hard. Try swapping BEER/PIZZA first using HyperDEX and learn how it works. BarterDEX GUI is for advanced users and devs.


[27-Oct-18 12:07 PM] Decker#3767
@SHossain i don't think that the BarterDEX GUI is for advanced users. We just need understandable description with examples of all functions and basics. Mean, before start BarterDEX every user should understand basic things:
1. what is utxo?
2. what is atomic swap and what the differencies between bdex and cex.
3. steps needed to swap complete.
4. small api description (users should know that alice and bob api exists, and should understand the difference between it)
without these basics - yes, users can find barterdex hard.

most confusing part is adding the coins, at least last time I used it


[27-Oct-18 12:11 PM] Decker#3767
@SHossain we have few docs and articles, but seems good idea is to make "Help" menu in BarterDEX interface with a "table of contents" (like How to use?), and all of these links in one place.


[27-Oct-18 12:12 PM] SHossain#0007
That would be also nice


[27-Oct-18 12:13 PM] SHossain#0007
probably something for first time users as splash screen explaining those would be good, along with the how to add coins video


[27-Oct-18 12:13 PM] SHossain#0007
we will try to get something done initially.


[27-Oct-18 12:14 PM] SHossain#0007
if not splash screen, a guide is first priority.


[27-Oct-18 12:47 PM] siu#3920
what we really need is an army of liquidty providers


[27-Oct-18 12:47 PM] siu#3920
if no reliable servers are online, then nothing will work as expected

no one is buying KMDICE in BarterDEX. even though there is a very high-end server running mm

the 3rd (the "split causer") is confirmed on the chain and checks out during a reindex, but not at the time that it forks

Yes its not nice to have to do... thats why I made staked repo choose branch and build all chains their own binaries automatically

any chain can have any branch, withoput affecting others, or human error

You could use the StakedNotary repo and change the assetchains.json accordingly for any chains you want to use.

and disable start_iguana script so it only starts komodods

^this is very useful for any machine that has many chains running on different branches

by fork, you mean it is on its own chain?

i guess you are mining on a node connected to the betting node


[27-Oct-18 02:26 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
by "fork", I mean that it refuses the next network accepted block (and as such the only block it will accept *will be* a fork)

the FSM branch should get it back on track, has a workaround for this, but clearly we need to find and fix the causal issue for this forking


[27-Oct-18 02:27 PM] jl777c#5810
some mempool dependency on consensus is my assessment

I'm on the FSM branch and the exact thing happened


[27-Oct-18 02:27 PM] jl777c#5810
if you stop and restart it, it doesnt sync to mainchain?


[27-Oct-18 02:28 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
yes, just like dev, if stopped and reindex, it will go back to main chain, but that doesn't stop the meanwhile fork if unattended


[27-Oct-18 02:29 PM] jl777c#5810
very strange, shossain had different behavior

any dice script or GUI can just check entropy and wallet for utxo before sending bet to avoid error


[27-Oct-18 03:14 PM] jl777c#5810

[27-Oct-18 03:18 PM] jl777c#5810

wouldn't it violate the same rule the second time no matter what?


[27-Oct-18 03:18 PM] jl777c#5810
so something about the mempool state makes it reject it the first time


[27-Oct-18 03:19 PM] jl777c#5810
then later it becomes valid as it is an onchain block

dealer needs to script entropy above X

I can get the network in that state

differing mempools

@siu @jorian a test chain with identical setup would be very handy

so the theory is that running out of entropy tx is bad, so lets change dicebet to not bet if there isnt enough entropy, like 10

based on numentropytx, creating enough to get to 100 entropy tx


[27-Oct-18 03:47 PM] jl777c#5810
if this makes the chain run stable, then we learn what is very likely the problem


[27-Oct-18 03:48 PM] jl777c#5810
and then we can attempt permanent solutions, but the dealer node doing blocknotify is likely part of the permanent solution

at least this is how I would go about solving this, but if you have better ideas, you can try

so in this case, KMDICE is broken as a stable chain

which means the first thing to do is get it stable

THEN, we worry about the exact issue, as until it is stable we really are just guessing

working + test -> working or not working, either way valuable info

There's nothing to be "left to"; either
a) the code needs to stop bettors from betting when contract stewards don't create sufficient entropy for a network of live players
or
b) contract stewards create sufficient entropy for a network of live players

@Alright if "every" node gets stuck and it ends up making a better chain (especially when people have paid for coins they can't use **now**) I can't see a harm to that (but rather that it would be a positive value for those that hold the coin now and in the future)

and even if you fix "the underlying problem", that still doesn't change the fact that if, out of the world's population, a mere 22 people place a bet between the same 2 blocks, 1 of them will get a fail

base it on segid of the pubkey you have set maybe

You can do what ever you want to try and reduce collisions, but as I discovered with igauan on notary nodes, unless you can stop the same utxo being chosen twice at all, its not perfect solution

if there are two txs spending the same input, miner picks one, puts into a block and other is entirely ignored


[27-Oct-18 05:36 PM] Alright#0419
it's not a dice specific problem at all

[27-Oct-18 05:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
maybe the solution is just to call `if ( myIsutxo_spentinmempool(entropytxid,0) != 0 )` this liek 100 times every second ?

`if there are two txs spending the same input, miner picks one, puts into a block and other is entirely ignored

and now all you need to do is go back into the wallet db of the "ignored" bettor and remove the tx their wallet has


[27-Oct-18 05:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
so the mempol has time to catch up ?

and that should not stop nodes or fork the network

[27-Oct-18 05:46 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
The fork happens when your local node decides that the contract UTXo belongs to your bet and not someone else's; therefore a block containing that UTXO spent by someone else is "invalid" to your node (because your node read the mempool and saw it non in use)

Sonetimes in old games you can find an easteregg in the funniest places or have to do 5 things to make it appear

```if ( entropytxs < 10 ) {

            fprintf(stderr,"%s\n", CCerror.c_str() );

using streamer/balster you can send txs that just never propagate at all, but can be mined by the local node without issue

the mempool is not that reliable

eespacially if a node floods a lot of tx at once.

I think @JL777 will solve this with side chains instead of multiple asset chains. We are 1 solution away from the answer.


[27-Oct-18 06:07 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
well, it doesn't help that the pools don't use node settings and drain the mempool either

If side chains are used, this appears to be an issue from 1985. All side chains are pegged to original chain and you can open up the mempool to infinity. Its not a matter of if...its a matter of when

with an infinate supply like USD :trollface:

I am still keen on the idea as adoption and use grows too, we can inflate the supply more... like a reverse halving, to a point then just back to static... stops whales making giant profits off users when it gets popular

@Tylor zkFS im pretty sure the front fell off


[27-Oct-18 07:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think if unconfirmed is 0 then it needs to also check just GetTransaction


[27-Oct-18 07:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
then it should be ok


[27-Oct-18 08:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
I worked it out, but I dont know how to fix it


[27-Oct-18 08:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
When it calls CC_EVAL when processing block, it should use ONLY `GetTxConfirmed`, and at every other time its called use `GetTXUnconfirmed`


[27-Oct-18 08:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
I thaught it would be easy, just add a bool to the function, and pass it in ConnectBlock but it does not work like that


[27-Oct-18 08:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
The DiceValidate is apssed in a scructure and has 0 arguments 🤷


[27-Oct-18 09:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
Might have worked it out ... simply forcing DiceValidate to need a confirmed entropy tx


[27-Oct-18 09:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
still can use unconfrimed bet tx... but entropy has to be confirmed


[27-Oct-18 09:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
when block arrives, mempool tx should just invalidate.. maybe


[27-Oct-18 09:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
Seems to work, but need more entropy to stress it out

if I fixed it right


[27-Oct-18 09:41 PM] Alright#0419
so one of us needs to ignore the other's txs?


[27-Oct-18 09:42 PM] Alright#0419
I can just reject all txs other than my own then eat up all the entropy


[27-Oct-18 09:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
I changed it so that dicevalidate needs the entropy TX to be confirmed


[27-Oct-18 09:42 PM] Deleted User#0000
rahter than unconnfirmed which tbh seems to make no sense and was alikely a mistake

as long as I cna see entropy txs... I can try and bet, but if you spent them already you will fork I think... or maybe not


[27-Oct-18 09:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
tbh having entropy being able to be spent from empool seems stupid, so this should fix it for sure

but until other people bet at the same time, I cant be 100%


[28-Oct-18 12:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think its working, because now its getting mad at me on DiceFinish for `could not find bet or entropy tx` I assume this is from invalidating the mempool TX that was previously forking/stalling the chain.


[28-Oct-18 12:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
will need some kind of error check in script for this I think


[28-Oct-18 12:57 AM] Deleted User#0000
going to solve this by @ComputerGenie's suggestion and have dicestatus return `null` when a tx gets invalidated.


[28-Oct-18 12:58 AM] Deleted User#0000

[28-Oct-18 02:04 AM] jl777c#5810
requiring entropy tx to be confirmed is a good fix! Seems the theory about mempool causing the local fork was indeed correct and a single addtional check would avoid this issue. great work!


[28-Oct-18 02:05 AM] jl777c#5810
only the entropytx is in a globally shared pool for all players


[28-Oct-18 02:05 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yes it appears to work, I really need someon other people to spam bets a single node cant really cause the fork on its own.


[28-Oct-18 02:05 AM] Deleted User#0000
there is plenty of entropy atm


[28-Oct-18 02:05 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no lock utxo globally rpc, would need a centralized node to even implement that

{Reactions}
👌 

[28-Oct-18 02:05 AM] jl777c#5810
but by requiring entropy tx to be confirmed, the dicebet itself does not have to be confirmed as the other vins are not globally shared


[28-Oct-18 02:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
yes dicebet is unconfirmed, entopy is confirmed... problem seems solved

2 is too low as 3 simultaneous bettors could end up choosing the same utxo. even though it should be cleanly handled now, the local bet will fail. much better to have the dealer node make sure there are 10+ entropy tx

yes 2 was mostly for my testing when total was 14


[28-Oct-18 02:18 AM] jl777c#5810
makes sense


[28-Oct-18 02:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
the getblock funtion is not good code, but I wasnt able to call it


[28-Oct-18 02:19 AM] jl777c#5810
with a blocknotify setting the entropy tx to 100+number of bets that block, it should be able to handle growth of 100 bets per block


[28-Oct-18 02:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
yes, using dicestatus you cna check entropy on blocknotarify (it should be accurate excatly at this time) then create entropy to a threshold


[28-Oct-18 02:20 AM] jl777c#5810
at validation time you are constrained in what you can do


[28-Oct-18 02:20 AM] jl777c#5810
very easy to get into a deadlock with all the semaphores being locked at higher levels


[28-Oct-18 02:21 AM] jl777c#5810
the threshold should be a dynamic one. unless it is just set to the max possible bets per block


[28-Oct-18 02:21 AM] jl777c#5810
if it is set to 100, and there are 200 bets wanting to be made each block, half of them will fail


[28-Oct-18 02:22 AM] jl777c#5810
so block.tx.size() + 100 would be a good blocknotify threshold


[28-Oct-18 02:22 AM] Deleted User#0000
hmm yes true ... jorian is not going to be avalibe to set it today anyway I think just having set to maximum per block (or even abit more) would be good, unles this slows it down, I know alright amde liek 20,000 of them and itwas still working on STAKED.

seems BTC was sort of internally designed for the 7 tx/sec


[28-Oct-18 02:23 AM] jl777c#5810

[28-Oct-18 02:24 AM] jl777c#5810
considering the relatively surgical fixes, it seems dice CC wasnt totally braindead, just unable to handle high load


[28-Oct-18 02:24 AM] jl777c#5810
and only way to know you can handle high load is to stress test it

The fork is fixed now... but if entropy is low (not sure hwo they are all gone already lol ) and 2 people are betting


[28-Oct-18 03:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
it send the bet, but then the tx is invalidated


[28-Oct-18 03:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
and my script gets stuck


[28-Oct-18 03:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
and its not on an error that is new, ie... that error happens during normal operation ... so will need to add a `GetTransaction` call here to check if tx was invalidated


[28-Oct-18 03:49 AM] jorian#4555

[28-Oct-18 03:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yes


[28-Oct-18 03:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
you need to add a -blocknotify script


[28-Oct-18 03:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
and call diceinfo


[28-Oct-18 03:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
that will give you `entropytxs` at the block receive


[28-Oct-18 03:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
then create X entropy to make up to Y


[28-Oct-18 03:51 AM] Deleted User#0000
Ideally it would be enough entropy to filla block


[28-Oct-18 03:51 AM] Deleted User#0000
maye the min entropy needs to be even higher in dicebet RPC... or maybe mine is still at 2 lol


[28-Oct-18 03:58 AM] jl777c#5810
@Deleted User any reason you didnt use CCduration to see if the txid was confirmed or not?

Aldo the ConfirmedTX call, did nt work as hashblock is not set by that function


[28-Oct-18 04:01 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think it was hash block


[28-Oct-18 04:01 AM] jl777c#5810
if hashblock is not set, it is unconfirmed


[28-Oct-18 04:01 AM] Deleted User#0000
yes... cchain didnt even sync using that


[28-Oct-18 04:01 AM] Deleted User#0000
maybe I can add hashblock to the confirmed tx call

and use that instead

what are you talking about?


[28-Oct-18 04:08 AM] jl777c#5810
there is the CCduration call that takes a txid and returns how many confirmations


[28-Oct-18 04:08 AM] jl777c#5810
if you need to check to see that a txid has confirms, just use CCduration

Kmdice seems to be a good tool to test the performance and illustrate the scalibity of Komodo blokchain. I wonder if it works as a zero-sum game or not. As far as I understand, people bet against the fund having half of total supply as premined coins. When betting, do people lose their bet into that fund? If so, it will be like a lottery game which means a zero-sum game. Or is it one side where people do not lose their bet. In that case it would be somehow draining all the funds in premined address in some period of time. Which one is the case?


[28-Oct-18 04:14 AM] Deleted User#0000
CCDuration is just returning "no hashBlock" however a getrawtransaction call on komodo-cli for that tx returns that the tx does not exist... I am fixing it prety sure I know what I did wrong.

its fine with 1 or 2 users... but add more and itbreaks... now @siu  could do an Alright and make 20,000 entropy txs and it would workfor a while likely

but eventually still stop


[28-Oct-18 05:26 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
@Deleted User there's only a tiny amount of bets that can be made at one time, and since pools aren't processing bets you just have to keep trying


[28-Oct-18 05:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
Ok following, just scrolled up a bit to catch up, thank you.


[28-Oct-18 05:27 AM] siu#3920
but the entropy txs get spent no matter what? I mean, even if the player loses, the bet doesnt become a entropy txs?


[28-Oct-18 05:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
There was a way that the node made its own... but Alright amde james remove it for some reason I still dont quite understand ... but we created a solution for that where you need to run blocknotify


[28-Oct-18 05:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
I guess I will need to write the script if no one else is going to do it :trollface:

`Height     Age     Transactions     Mined by     Size

Is still going to be an issue with any real adoption even with 25000 UTXOs in the contract


[28-Oct-18 05:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
Its possibly a consensus change and hard fork that I made


[28-Oct-18 05:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
as the entropytx now needs to be confirmed before dicevalidate passes


[28-Oct-18 05:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
so the pool could be making blocks, with entropy that are in mempool


[28-Oct-18 05:34 AM] siu#3920
Hmm


[28-Oct-18 05:35 AM] Deleted User#0000

Just because I was able to et against myself 300 times, doenst mean it fixed anything as no one else was betting


[28-Oct-18 05:36 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
in order to work well, even with "fixes", there's got to be at least 40% of the hashrate in a pool that's going to actually process txes; otherwise, it's just going to pile up and the same result will just be from a different cause

[28-Oct-18 05:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
There are most likely too many ppl on the old version adn the pool... also there is no entropy constnatly... I also *think* the function that returns entropy is always just selecting the first one it sees, where it probably should randomly choose one to avoid conflicts ?


[28-Oct-18 05:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
Maybe I need somethig like my utxo selection code I used in iguana 🤔


[28-Oct-18 05:53 AM] jl777c#5810
yes random selecting would be much better


[28-Oct-18 05:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think thats a much better solutiona and would help a lot... We are astartiong a test chain on staked so we can actually test stuff, I will amke PR again when finished and give blocknotify script


[28-Oct-18 05:58 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
random selection of 1 out of 1 will still select 1


[28-Oct-18 05:58 AM] Deleted User#0000
yes ... which is why that will be the last thing I try to fix 😄

blocknotify scrpipt that works is number 1 priority...


[28-Oct-18 06:01 AM] Deleted User#0000
but I dont want to just amke it work by brute forceing entropy txs ... that doesnt help a lot


[28-Oct-18 06:02 AM] Deleted User#0000
I have a feeling that just the change i made that makes entropy need to be confirmed, on the MINER will help a lot


[28-Oct-18 06:02 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
blocknotify scrpipt only help if the block contains more than 2 txes (for the 100000000000000000th time)


[28-Oct-18 06:02 AM] Deleted User#0000
blocknotiy just keeps entropy at X


[28-Oct-18 06:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
the main thing is to make the miner mien the blocks, if it still cant, the the mempool is accepting txs that are invlaid


[28-Oct-18 06:04 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`the main thing is to make the miner mien the blocks`
ok, you're 1/2 way to understanding what I'm saying, at least
the main thing is to make the miner mine the blocks **with transactions in the block**


[28-Oct-18 06:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
yes ... and your are saying that min block size is forcing the mempool into the block?


[28-Oct-18 06:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
or its just waiting until it has enough valid txs?


[28-Oct-18 06:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
and still leaving a bunch behind?


[28-Oct-18 06:11 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
Gavin Andresen did a lot of good things in his time but some of the code in 0.9 created problems just like this
`accept-into-block
Require that miners set -mintxfee, -minblocksize, etc; refuse to mine if they do not. WHY: decentralize decisions about fees/block sizes/etc.`
by default, a node will not pack the template unless you force it to


[28-Oct-18 06:12 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
and that theory has never changed (even with the removal of minblocksize in current bitcoin)


[28-Oct-18 06:12 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
default bitcoin node will never produce a full block


[28-Oct-18 06:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
hmmm ... streamer and that do , and I never set any of those


[28-Oct-18 06:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
but thanks will make sure our miner is using it ... start with CPU if that works add stratum and see what happens


[28-Oct-18 06:14 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`streamer and that do , and I never set any of those`
because you're doing something entirely different - part of this goes to the convo/issue in the locked channel


[28-Oct-18 06:17 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
the other part goes to 'depends', if a "depended upon" tx isn't in the block, then the "dependent" tx(es) will not be either


[28-Oct-18 06:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yes thats how the streamer works, each tx depends on the tx before it, so they never arrive out of order


[28-Oct-18 06:28 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
yes, but with steamer, you're actively looking for that "parent" tx (and not just "stumbling upon it"), no?


[28-Oct-18 06:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
Any tx seen in any block will point the the first tx sent


[28-Oct-18 06:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
and what block its in


[28-Oct-18 06:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
not perfect... but i figured steaming would use blocknotify, so you start the chain


[28-Oct-18 06:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
and wait until blocknotify gives you a return, then seek back to that block and pull it out


[28-Oct-18 06:40 AM] Deleted User#0000
for a whole bunch of files... maybe there needs to ne an oracle on the chain you post the location of the files to.


[28-Oct-18 06:41 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
right, and that's not how bitcoin works 😛


[28-Oct-18 06:41 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe using baton utxo


[28-Oct-18 06:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
I never designed it t have more than one file


[28-Oct-18 06:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
but if you sent them one after the other with a diffrent ID


[28-Oct-18 06:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
you can do it


[28-Oct-18 06:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
Its got an easy pattern to seek to it, there is always a block with 3tx before the next stream


[28-Oct-18 06:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
iterating over all blocks for a big chain is too slow though

like I said before, s/k/znomp being "easy enough for anyone to set up their own pool" can create more problems than it fixes by having a gajillion pool ops that don't know what they are doing

well, the other side of that is needing new miner apps (since most are now built on a version of cgminer that also no longer has it)

[28-Oct-18 08:17 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
actually, it's probably a big loss if you count all of the `CCduration no hashBlock for txid` txes that the contract eats up


[28-Oct-18 08:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
so if that keeps spamming your discarding those ones?


[28-Oct-18 08:21 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
when you resend the tx and it gets put in a block, it never gets tested as a bet (it's just you giving the contract x coins)


[28-Oct-18 08:21 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
if it pays fees, my node discards nothing


[28-Oct-18 08:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
hmm... I find that spams a few times then the eventually process... your sayign your resendig the raw tx and its just being skipped by the contract


[28-Oct-18 08:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
?


[28-Oct-18 08:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think this fix I just added might help those a fair bit, as the entropy tx used by the bet now needs to be confirmed, so it cannot process at all unless ther eis a hashBlock


[28-Oct-18 08:25 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
if you do
`komodo-cli -ac_name=$AssetChain resendwallettransactions`
and it never has anything other than `bet still pending` when you do `discestatus`, then it will get blocked as a normal tx

I cannot work out how to fix it properly


[29-Oct-18 02:58 AM] Deleted User#0000
The issue is that myGetTransaction just randonly and only a very very small percentage of the time, does not return a tx when it in fact does exist.


[29-Oct-18 02:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
To get around this, I have changed the utxo selection everywhere to random loops


[29-Oct-18 02:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
and if that check fails, i just skip it and any code that segfaults later because it was skipped


[29-Oct-18 02:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
this stops the node going on a fork and lets it keep betting, but I have no idea what the rammifications are...


[29-Oct-18 03:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
The amin issue stil seems to be the main pool, not actually minign transactions... Someone needs to either DDoS htat pool down until they fix it, or people need to stop mining there.


[29-Oct-18 03:02 AM] Deleted User#0000
Also if there was a way to call CC_EVAL during processing blocks, where it ignores mempool tx's that would likely fix the underlying cause also.


[29-Oct-18 03:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
It currently some how thinks a mempool tx invalidets a received block, which is very backwards lol


[29-Oct-18 03:09 AM] jl777c#5810
whether the tx are being mined or not should not affect the consensus bug. the problem with doing CC eval for the acceptmempool tx is that it will reject valid tx when dependent ones arrive out of order


[29-Oct-18 03:09 AM] Deleted User#0000
yes. When I first started looking at it I was just going to try and add a boolean to CC_EVAL where it was called in connect block, but it does not work like that


[29-Oct-18 03:09 AM] jl777c#5810
the CC eval happens on accept to mempool and also on block validation


[29-Oct-18 03:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
issue seems to only occur when you are betting


[29-Oct-18 03:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
and the more bets you can amke on a single node te more likely it is to happen.


[29-Oct-18 03:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
your local txs in mempool make the received block invalid


[29-Oct-18 03:10 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont see how that can happen


[29-Oct-18 03:11 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, wait


[29-Oct-18 03:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
the onyl way to let the block connect is to skip the Unconformed TX call, or at least dont return a fail when it fails


[29-Oct-18 03:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
my fix yesterday was that by accident...


[29-Oct-18 03:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
chain seems to sync and doesnt fork so maybe it doesnt matter


[29-Oct-18 03:12 AM] jl777c#5810
on validating a block, all the tx in the block are put in to the mempool to remove any order dependent validation requirements


[29-Oct-18 03:12 AM] jl777c#5810
but if in the mempool there are already some conflicting tx, it wouldnt be able to put some that are in the block into the mempool!


[29-Oct-18 03:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
this makes sense as its random txs and never the same ones.. they just disappear


[29-Oct-18 03:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
requiring resync to get them back


[29-Oct-18 03:13 AM] jl777c#5810
so we need to remove from the mempool any conflicting tx to the one coming from the block


[29-Oct-18 03:13 AM] jl777c#5810
no wonder it is hard to fix


[29-Oct-18 03:13 AM] jl777c#5810

[29-Oct-18 03:13 AM] jl777c#5810

thats what happens yes


[29-Oct-18 03:14 AM] jl777c#5810
and then it ends up with tx in the mempool that are now orphaned, but the local node wont see that as it rejects the block that contradicts it


[29-Oct-18 03:14 AM] jl777c#5810
aha!


[29-Oct-18 03:15 AM] jl777c#5810
so now we understand the causal factor for all the strange behavior!!


[29-Oct-18 03:15 AM] jl777c#5810
in main.cpp there is a loop adding to the mempool in block validation


[29-Oct-18 03:15 AM] jl777c#5810
it actually does it iteratively as the tx in the block can be in any order


[29-Oct-18 03:16 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, a quick test idea!


[29-Oct-18 03:16 AM] jl777c#5810
before that loop, just clear the local mempool entirely


[29-Oct-18 03:16 AM] jl777c#5810
then there cant be anything conflicting in the mempool, the block confirms, node will not go on a fork or get stuck


[29-Oct-18 03:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
ok sounds like a good idea, and probalbly wont cause anything bad either

[29-Oct-18 03:19 AM] jl777c#5810
if ( ASSETCHAINS_CC != 0 ) // CC contracts might refer to transactions in the current block, from a CC spend within the same block and out of order
4246 main.cpp, inside that if , clear the mempool before it does the loop


[29-Oct-18 03:19 AM] jl777c#5810
your method of randomly selecting utxo is a workaround, it reduces the chance from happening, but doesnt prevent things


[29-Oct-18 03:20 AM] jl777c#5810
i think just adding the clearmempool might just stabilize things a lot as without it, the local mempool will cause properly mined blocks to be rejected


[29-Oct-18 03:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
yes, it helps, I think that will be needed aswell though.. as once more than 2-3 people bet no bets work


[29-Oct-18 03:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
as they all use the same entropy


[29-Oct-18 03:20 AM] Deleted User#0000

good. i am happy about this realization. very tricky that local mempool can cause a valid block to be invalid


[29-Oct-18 03:23 AM] jl777c#5810
but this also means that the mempool will be cleared with each block....

[29-Oct-18 03:25 AM] jl777c#5810
this will end up removing the conflicting local mempool tx from the mempool!


[29-Oct-18 03:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
yes this will cause other issues with dice app, where a tx it thinks was sent disapears, but at least the chain will work.

should be a way of detecting that


[29-Oct-18 03:26 AM] jl777c#5810
tx do get orphaned, but as long as only the truly orphaned tx disappear

I think my dice loop script already handles such conditions, as it resends raw transaction until confirmed.. and if the tx becomes invalid, it would fail to send triggering error

[29-Oct-18 06:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
The problem btw is that the CC chains unload the incoming block into mempool, so the mempool has to be cearled of txs as if a conflicting one happens, then the block is invalideted by the local mempool. and tx just disapear, causing allkinds of strange behaviours.


[29-Oct-18 06:26 AM] ComputerGenie#7004

there needs to be a fix for when the mempool is large, that is separate from the fact that the pool is *currently* large because @forkwitch has his daemon running in default-mode (which intentionally processes as little info as possible to create a better experience for a "normal" user that doesn't need to fill up RAM with 500 tx that aren't theirs and they don't need to know about)

After block arrives 30-40 txs are orphaned and the dicebet script sees they are gone upong tryong to rebradcast, reports and sends a new transaction. So far no crashes or forks 😄

The utxo selection for CC contracts is not designed for spamming the crap out of it on multiple nodes at once... I changed all of it though today to amke it easier to test. 
For entropy it wont let you send, unless the total is over 100, but thousands is even better, then it chooses randomly one of them. 
For local wallet I did same algo, but it checks if you have over 200 utxo in your wallet before applying random filter... ended up removing this though as I expect it to cause issues for peopel who dont understand utxo's ...

i think it would have been better to make the dice rigged to give a chance of winning the game 50.001% or something minimally higher . Hodlers, miners would understand that in the long run they would lose in relative terms, everyone would gamble it would become a wild west shit show.


[29-Oct-18 09:58 AM] idrtis#7552
people would write bots to gamble in small amounts to make the winning edge appear. normal people would see this and rush to gamble before bot herds are able to accumulate

house having 0% edge is unique


[29-Oct-18 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
and the highest sustainable payout


[29-Oct-18 10:02 AM] idrtis#7552
i am talking about house having negative edge. because no one has the keys or access to those funds it wouldnt matter. And it would incentivize people to gamble like crazy


[29-Oct-18 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
negative edge will run out at some point


[29-Oct-18 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess it would act a bit like mining, but the house having such large bankroll makes it pretty interesting


[29-Oct-18 10:04 AM] idrtis#7552
yeah. when it looks like runing out maybe direct % of block reward to house fund or make a coin swap to another blockchain game


[29-Oct-18 10:05 AM] idrtis#7552
promote craziness


[29-Oct-18 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
a negative edge chain would get drained and then not be viable. seems short sighted to make it a matter of time before its drained, doesnt seem a good long term setup


[29-Oct-18 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
like you say, bots would be all over it and will be just drained as fast as possible. as it is, it is already quite actively used


[29-Oct-18 10:07 AM] idrtis#7552

weird. 260 txns block, it is just above the 128-256 range

i think it could be that optimal varint encoding is required

Has anyone tested that new version or did you just update, you need to male sure that txs your trying to send are not lost for no reason... When it re adds to the mempool on block receive if you have valid txs maybe they would not be added for some reason , it seemed OK, but I ran out of day to tst it in a controlled fashion.


[29-Oct-18 05:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think the miners may have issues trying to use that version, or maybe they don't, I guess a test chain will br needed to test that 100%


[29-Oct-18 05:24 PM] Deleted User#0000

and there are simply no txs in my mempool


[29-Oct-18 06:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
It could be that emptying it every block doesnt allow enough time for it to progagate through the network


[29-Oct-18 06:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
I hope that isnt the case, as that means instead of just copying the whole mempool, it will need to check each tx being added to the mempool against what is in the mempool, and remove only hte invalid txs in the local mempool, to allow the txs in the block to be added.

[30-Oct-18 01:48 AM] jl777c#5810
the 1 second per dicefinish is an arbitrary restriction. an optimized dealer processing that uses multiple queues for dicebet in different states should be able to handle 10x or 100x more


[30-Oct-18 01:49 AM] jl777c#5810
it is not even consensus level code, more like a multithreaded dapp, but it is inside the dice.cpp

[30-Oct-18 04:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
Pending usually happens if the dealer node is backed up...


[30-Oct-18 04:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
The only other thing that can happen, is if the dicebet tx was sent, but another dicebet is confirmed in a block, and the dicebet tx can get orphaned


[30-Oct-18 04:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
There likely needs to be some check added... To dice scripts, or GUI that tries to resend rawtransaction every few seconds. As once hte TX is invalidated by an incomoing block it will then fail to send, and the dAPP will know to create  a new one.


[30-Oct-18 04:51 AM] Deleted User#0000
Also the code that chooses utxo locally, isnt randomised and in real time, so you can create bad transactions with it espicially if you create them too quickly... there is some commented code in my commit you can uncomment to fix that, but it then allows nodes to spam contracts.


[30-Oct-18 05:19 AM] siu#3920
it eventually confirmed


[30-Oct-18 05:19 AM] siu#3920
unlike the orphaned ones that end up saying something like "couldnt decode txid"


[30-Oct-18 05:20 AM] jl777c#5810
so any problems since the latest update?


[30-Oct-18 05:21 AM] siu#3920
so far none... other than the pending tx that confirmed eventually, nothing bad


[30-Oct-18 05:22 AM] siu#3920

[30-Oct-18 05:44 AM] Alright#0419
pending because dealer hasn't done dicefinish yet


[30-Oct-18 05:44 AM] Deleted User#0000
Thats what I thaught


[30-Oct-18 05:45 AM] Deleted User#0000
so its just a matter or someone multithreading the dealer, or simply having multiple tables to spread the load out.


[30-Oct-18 05:45 AM] Alright#0419
dealer should really wait until bet is notarized if they want to be careful

[30-Oct-18 05:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
those seem the last bottle neck here


[30-Oct-18 05:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
but I think we need to test some other contracts on a chain with the mempool fix and make sure it doesnt break them


[30-Oct-18 05:49 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, lets make sure things are stable now then we can speed it up and make it 51% secure


[30-Oct-18 05:49 AM] jl777c#5810
one easy way to speed up dealer node processing is as follows:


[30-Oct-18 05:49 AM] jl777c#5810
make 4 dealer nodes, dealer0, dealer1, dealer2, dealer3


[30-Oct-18 05:50 AM] jl777c#5810
for each incoming tx, mask all but the last 2 bits of the bettxid and only process the one that matches the dealer nodeid


[30-Oct-18 05:50 AM] siu#3920
so, do we do a campaign to get more betters or do we do scripts?

tbh without a dealer node speed up there isnt much point trying ot stress it..

using 3 bits you can have 8 nodes

the issue with forks have stopped no?


[30-Oct-18 05:51 AM] jl777c#5810
we need to make sure forkwitch pool is updated

then stress it as much as we can with scripts

I left some comented out code in my commit that allows a single node to do a LOT of bets at once.


[30-Oct-18 05:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
but the pool isnt mining enough txs at this stage ... the pool with the most hash rate should never fork even on old version, as its choosing txs out of its own mempool, so should never be able to invalidate its own block.


[30-Oct-18 05:54 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, but for a clean test, the biggest (only?) pool should be on the latest version


[30-Oct-18 05:55 AM] Deleted User#0000

public?


[30-Oct-18 06:02 AM] siu#3920
do you think that having the house node running in various servers at the same time would fix something?


[30-Oct-18 06:03 AM] jl777c#5810
not until there is a way to have dealerids


[30-Oct-18 06:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah that would likely cause more problems than it would solve... So the idea is to spread the load over multiple dealer nodes


[30-Oct-18 06:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think just having more tables does much the same thing ?


[30-Oct-18 06:04 AM] jl777c#5810
if different pubkeys make different tables, then it would spread the load


[30-Oct-18 06:05 AM] jl777c#5810
just having a way to set dealer id, make sure you have all 4 running and then you get 4x capacity


[30-Oct-18 06:05 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think your idea will be very useful for other contacts though, so it might be a good thing to work on next to keep learning about them. I wil have to write a contract at come point so I should get more experiance with them in any way possible.


[30-Oct-18 06:06 AM] jl777c#5810
additionally, making it have more of an internal state machine control flow, with different queues for different states would get 10x or more capacity


[30-Oct-18 06:06 AM] jl777c#5810
right now one node is queuing all dicebets to process


[30-Oct-18 06:06 AM] jl777c#5810
then in the background processes them serially


[30-Oct-18 06:07 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess that can just be made into multiple threads to make things go in parallel as long as the proper locks are done


[30-Oct-18 06:07 AM] jl777c#5810
multithreaded dapp code is a bit tricky though


[30-Oct-18 06:07 AM] jl777c#5810
there really isnt that much processing, most of it is waiting for it to appear in the mempool


[30-Oct-18 06:08 AM] jl777c#5810
so I would suggest breaking down the dealer node dicebet processing into as many different steps as possible


[30-Oct-18 06:08 AM] jl777c#5810
making a queue of requests for each step


[30-Oct-18 06:08 AM] jl777c#5810
launching a thread to handle each queue


[30-Oct-18 06:08 AM] siu#3920
the problem for KMDICE is that all funds where used in one table so there isnot much capacity to do more tables now :/


[30-Oct-18 06:08 AM] SHossain#0007

not sure what the incentivize would be to use another dealer though

imo using many dealers just spreads out the fun


[30-Oct-18 06:11 AM] jl777c#5810
if the dealer node could process 100x the tx, what would the issues be?

do you have enough to implement the multiple queues approach?


[30-Oct-18 06:12 AM] jl777c#5810
yes it is a bit beyond what you have done so far, but i think within reach


[30-Oct-18 06:12 AM] jl777c#5810
the idea is to not have any sleeps

{Reactions}
😂 trollface (2) 

[30-Oct-18 06:13 AM] jl777c#5810
so it is 100% of the time processing a new bet


[30-Oct-18 06:13 AM] jl777c#5810
from what I remember the time from when it is broadcast to when it appears in the mempool was a bit slow and I had to add a sleep


[30-Oct-18 06:14 AM] jl777c#5810
what you do instead of putting a sleep, is to put it into another queue


[30-Oct-18 06:14 AM] jl777c#5810
then the first loop is done!


[30-Oct-18 06:14 AM] jl777c#5810
so it can then keep up with a lot of dicebet coming in


[30-Oct-18 06:15 AM] jl777c#5810
then there is another thread that processes the other queue, what it does it iterate through the list and sees if it is done, if it is, it removes the entry and completes the processing


[30-Oct-18 06:15 AM] jl777c#5810
probably a 10 millisecond sleep at the end of the queue before starting again to prevent eating up 100% of a core just looping over and over


[30-Oct-18 06:15 AM] jl777c#5810
i think the above will increase throughput immensely as it removes the sleep 1 entirely


[30-Oct-18 06:16 AM] jl777c#5810
so if 10 tx can be processed in a second it is 10x capacity increase


[30-Oct-18 06:16 AM] jl777c#5810
but 100+ can be done in a second


[30-Oct-18 06:16 AM] jl777c#5810
ask if you have any questions about the design


[30-Oct-18 06:16 AM] jl777c#5810
this is a standard way to speed things up. whenever there is a need for a sleep, put it in a queue


[30-Oct-18 06:17 AM] jl777c#5810
then process that queue in parallel. if that processing also needs a sleep, you make another queue, etc

what is the process for creating a 50% premine into the dice contract?

`./komodod -ac_name=KMDICE -ac_supply=10500000 -ac_reward=2500000000 -ac_halving=210000 -ac_cc=2 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -addnode=144.76.217.232 &`
the `-ac_supply=10500000` is the premined fund. you need to create fund the dice contract using that fund

should be ok, but definitely need to make sure

lucky someone one made some onthis chain, eary on and I was able to spot the error that stopped it to sync


[01-Nov-18 12:28 AM] jl777c#5810
probably the verifier was marked as already spent


[01-Nov-18 12:28 AM] jl777c#5810
so when you removed it, you didnt mark it as unspent. but all that gets very dangerous to mess around with. just adding it back seems best


[01-Nov-18 12:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
yes it only does it on that operation, I added a conditional bool to `AcceptToMemoryPool` for just the CC checks.


[01-Nov-18 12:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
in all normal mempool adds it checks them as normal


[01-Nov-18 12:30 AM] jl777c#5810
yes i saw that, was wondering why


[01-Nov-18 12:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
took me a while to work out how to do it

it just adds them back with no check

assuming the tx was checked the first time it was added to mempool

this will add ztx back to mempool after a confirmed block though... the best way would be to disable the mempool fix on chain sync... but couldnt work that out

yes, likely it cant add it back to mempool


[01-Nov-18 01:23 AM] jl777c#5810
what you need to do is NOT delete it from the mempool in the first place


[01-Nov-18 01:24 AM] jl777c#5810
i think it marks the zksnark proof as spent


[01-Nov-18 01:24 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe when it goes into the mempool...


[01-Nov-18 01:25 AM] jl777c#5810
so if you can only remove non-ztx from the mempool, it should fix this


[01-Nov-18 01:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
ok will try it


[01-Nov-18 01:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
not sure how easy that is, though, as simply `mempool.clear()`


[01-Nov-18 01:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
is a lot eaier than deleting each tx as its moved to the other mempool


[01-Nov-18 01:25 AM] jl777c#5810
you need to make a mempool.cleartaddr()


[01-Nov-18 01:26 AM] jl777c#5810
something that doesnt clear a ztx


[01-Nov-18 01:26 AM] jl777c#5810

and dont add ztx to the tmp mempool


[01-Nov-18 01:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
Maybe before that, I should locally remove all changes I made and try to send a Z tx ...


[01-Nov-18 01:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
just incase its something else


[01-Nov-18 01:27 AM] jl777c#5810
FSM only has the mempool fix, including the mempool flag for ztx


[01-Nov-18 01:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
as its a local thing, that your node cannot accept its own tx


[01-Nov-18 01:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
and they send on other branches ?


[01-Nov-18 01:28 AM] Deleted User#0000
or at least add to mempool ?


[01-Nov-18 01:28 AM] Alright#0419
please don't try that on KMDICE

@Deleted User I just explained why i think it isnt working


[01-Nov-18 01:34 AM] jl777c#5810
you didnt mark the spent verifier as unspent, so it is still marked as spent


[01-Nov-18 01:35 AM] jl777c#5810
and when you try to add it to the mempool again, it says, "hey that is already spent, this isnt bitcoin core, you cant double spend"


[01-Nov-18 01:35 AM] jl777c#5810
but dont go messing with the zksnark internals!


[01-Nov-18 01:35 AM] jl777c#5810
just remove only the non-ztx from the mempool


[01-Nov-18 01:35 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe as you make the copy, you can just remove the single tx from the mempool


[01-Nov-18 01:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
lol.... but this is not happening on re-add ... it son the initaial add ... on the re add it skips the check all together and juts adds it, but anyway will inviestingte this now, first prioroty here

not sure how you know exactly when it is being rejected...


[01-Nov-18 01:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
there must be a check that enables the z-tx to be checked to the right function, so it the opposite of that then copy and remove


[01-Nov-18 01:37 AM] Deleted User#0000

You can either customise the clear memory pool clear to leave ztx behind, or just not check them when adding them abck, I see no diffrence.. in any case testing now, if this doesnt work, I will change the mempool clear to leave ztx behind


[01-Nov-18 06:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
yes they are now sending on a normal chain...


[01-Nov-18 06:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
will activate CC's on this test chain


[01-Nov-18 06:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
and test them there make sure it can sync


[01-Nov-18 06:42 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so you unbroke the ztx!


[01-Nov-18 06:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
Well to be fair I broke it


[01-Nov-18 06:42 AM] jl777c#5810
good to get a pull request for that


[01-Nov-18 06:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
true != false


[01-Nov-18 06:43 AM] jl777c#5810
but i guess if it cant sync KMDICE then it is not good...


[01-Nov-18 06:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
I will just make sure it still works on CC chains then submit PR


[01-Nov-18 06:43 AM] jl777c#5810
ok


[01-Nov-18 06:44 AM] Deleted User#0000
I am guessing that the CheckJoinSplits function, updates some pointers, so when it was missed it failed the check inputs check  further down the line


[01-Nov-18 06:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
Also that longestchain miner check should be disabled under 128 blocks, it slows the miner down a lot .. .can I submit that too?


[01-Nov-18 06:52 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, but maybe in a different PR after ztx is working stable again


[01-Nov-18 07:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
yes, ok ..


[01-Nov-18 07:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
well after I fixed them for normal chains, the CC chain wont sync again... not sure why though...


[01-Nov-18 07:04 AM] jl777c#5810
i think best to not remove the ztx from mempool, then we dont need to go through taking it out and putting it back in


[01-Nov-18 07:04 AM] jl777c#5810
which I already said likely wont work without revaliating the verifiers


[01-Nov-18 07:04 AM] jl777c#5810
but that is all very tricky stuff


[01-Nov-18 07:05 AM] jl777c#5810
if you are tired, then maybe the sleep thing and do this when fresh


[01-Nov-18 07:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yes the solution is to check if a tx has joinsplits before adding to tmp mempool, then remove each tx after adding to the tempmempool


[01-Nov-18 07:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
What happens is, if the tx is in the mempool, when the block arrives, the daemo gets deadlocked


[01-Nov-18 07:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
the skip works, but only on sync it seems


[01-Nov-18 07:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
I am not tired, this is preobably he best time I have to get it fixed everyone is asleep so I can concentrate

About to slam bets from 2 nodes ... cant do z-tx on KMDICE until all notaries and pools are on that verison, as it could fork.

or the tx will never leave your node


[01-Nov-18 10:04 AM] Decker#3767
seems something wrong happened with KMDICE ... my latest bet tx f518c162834bee5b3a7466333ba7893896d68a939ddea2ec698c2acd04d67d95 , right after send result was:
```"result": "success",
"status": "win",
"won": 3000```
and i saw these 3000 in unconfirmed balance ... but after some blocks these 3000 it's just disappeared from `unconfirmed_balance` and now `dicestatus` on this tx returns `couldnt find bettx or spenttx %s\n` )

may be it comes to me when 69 txes from mempool will included in block ... but anyway looks bad ... you have 3000 KMDICE and after some time haven't ))


[01-Nov-18 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
it got orphaned


[01-Nov-18 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
just as often losses will be orphaned as it is a random process

he-he ... then i'm super lucky ... just lose ~8000 in orphaned )


[01-Nov-18 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
with KMDICE whether your dicebet gets orphaned is also a gamble


[01-Nov-18 10:11 AM] Decker#3767
yeah ... i think bet tx with "lose" can be orphaned same way and funds will return ...

thanks for reporting them. best to fix these types of things, 2 of them could have caused problems


[01-Nov-18 11:46 AM] cipi#4502
yes, i am not a dev, but things like `directive writing up to 255 bytes into a region of size between 219 and 238` sounds bad
looks like gcc-8 could be useful to find such things


[01-Nov-18 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
considering the amount of code, it is good sign that so few of these stric warnings

its just that the dealer node can only process 1 bet every 1s

adn I am sending 10x that amount or more


[01-Nov-18 04:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
when it stops sending the dealer should eventally process them all and it will work again

😮


[02-Nov-18 04:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
yes this is why hte dealer node needs to be "fixed" not that its broken, but having a single table, means it needs to be able to handle all players


[02-Nov-18 04:31 AM] jorian#4555
when the dealer node is off line, bets are still allowed?


[02-Nov-18 04:32 AM] Deleted User#0000
yes


[02-Nov-18 04:32 AM] Deleted User#0000
the funding is in a CC contract, all the deler does is process dicefinish


[02-Nov-18 04:33 AM] jorian#4555
why would you always win bets when the node is offline? doesn't make sense conceptually


[02-Nov-18 04:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
they time out


[02-Nov-18 04:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
it has to be offline for uite a while

dude fixed it


[02-Nov-18 04:39 AM] Alright#0419
@jorian what the dealer is doing by doing dicefinish is sending a transaction that reveals the entropy, so it can be determined if it's a win/loss


[02-Nov-18 04:40 AM] Alright#0419
if dealer doesn't submit the entropy(dicefinish tx) after 600 blocks(time out set on plan), the better can do dicefinish and it's an automatic win

hopefully as you process the pending tx, it will stop doing such things

the mempool fix helps but there is stil a problem


[02-Nov-18 06:07 AM] jl777c#5810
i think in miner.cpp it assumes that the order in the mempool matches the order of dependency, but really it can be random so i think a lot are being skipped


[02-Nov-18 06:07 AM] jl777c#5810
CreateNewBlock or something like that is the one that makes a new block template for mining


[02-Nov-18 06:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
@ComputerGenie  was able to make his pool mine large blocks, but gave up as there was too much hash on the other one.


[02-Nov-18 06:10 AM] jl777c#5810
I will look into this one, it really shouldnt be skipping so many tx


[02-Nov-18 06:22 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems a lot of the tx are 0 fee tx?


[02-Nov-18 06:25 AM] jl777c#5810
bug seems to be tx of the form: http://kmdice.explorer.dexstats.info/tx/bad63c85765bc34e4f788cb1156b104eb3a1751f2fa00d6bb7deade10f675224

not having a txfee!


[02-Nov-18 06:25 AM] jl777c#5810
this is a non-consensus fix in the dicefinish to add a txfee


[02-Nov-18 06:42 AM] siu#3920
Why would they not have txfee ?


[02-Nov-18 06:43 AM] siu#3920

bunch of txs in mempool with 0 fee


[02-Nov-18 07:04 AM] Alright#0419
or is it like that by default?


[02-Nov-18 07:07 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
you don't want it 0
basically, you want a full block and in this order
paying over min
paying min
paying some
paying none


[02-Nov-18 08:20 AM] jl777c#5810
i think one of the dicefinish tx constructors is off by txfee


[02-Nov-18 08:20 AM] jl777c#5810
once that is fixed and the dealer node updated, we should get most all the mempool confirming each block


[02-Nov-18 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, this is indeed confirmed: "fee rate skip" is the reason


[02-Nov-18 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
I can certainly fix it fast enough, but it would be good for someone like @Alright to find the bug and maybe even fix it


[02-Nov-18 08:24 AM] jl777c#5810
it will be easy enough to verify as the txfee wont be 0 after the fix


[02-Nov-18 08:28 AM] Alright#0419
I can try. I'm a bit preoccupied with STAKED testnet launch atm however. Is it a vital fix?


[02-Nov-18 08:28 AM] Alright#0419
I'll drop what I'm doing over there if so


[02-Nov-18 08:34 AM] jl777c#5810
not vital


[02-Nov-18 08:34 AM] jl777c#5810
just will allow a lot more dicebet per block


[02-Nov-18 08:34 AM] jl777c#5810
bottleneck is dicefinish appears to be making 0txfee so the miner (correctly) only allows a few per block


[02-Nov-18 08:35 AM] jl777c#5810
with the current dealer node code, 60 per block should be sustainable


[02-Nov-18 08:35 AM] Alright#0419
ok understood, will start looking at contract code in a couple hours


[02-Nov-18 08:35 AM] jl777c#5810
once it gets the completion queues, then 1000+ per block


[02-Nov-18 08:35 AM] jl777c#5810
just look at the dice.cpp DiceFinish where it is constructing the txfee, likely it just needs an extra txfee added


[02-Nov-18 08:35 AM] Alright#0419
just tack on 10k sat fee to each dicefinish tx?


[02-Nov-18 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
should literally be a few char fix as it probably tries to get txfee or 2*txfee and it needs to be 2*txfee or 3*txfee


[02-Nov-18 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
best to fix only what is broken, so need to find the path that leads to 0 txfee and boost that by a txfee


[02-Nov-18 08:36 AM] Alright#0419
👌


[02-Nov-18 08:41 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`bottleneck is dicefinish appears to be making 0txfee so the miner (correctly) only allows a few per block`
Or the pool could stop using default end-user settings and set it up to scrape properly
#justSayin


[02-Nov-18 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, but we dont want to have the only pool setup in a configuration that would allow a bunch of 0 fee tx


[02-Nov-18 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
best to fix this bug, especially if it is just the dealer node that needs to be updated


[02-Nov-18 08:42 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
I'm not seeing how allowing 0fee is a "bug" but ok


[02-Nov-18 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
i see the bug, it is indeed a matter to change txfee to 2*txfee since the 'L' path adds a marker vout


[02-Nov-18 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810
is it true that wins have nonzero txfee, but losses have 0 txfee?


[02-Nov-18 09:08 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, all dicefinish paths appears to be 0 txfee. how did we not notice this before?


[02-Nov-18 09:09 AM] Alright#0419
didn't matter until now I guess


[02-Nov-18 09:09 AM] jl777c#5810

[02-Nov-18 09:10 AM] jl777c#5810

`oh, all dicefinish paths appears to be 0 txfee. how did we not notice this before?`
I can see the *creation* of a 0fee being a bug, but still not seeing where a pool being able to *process* 0fee is


[02-Nov-18 09:17 AM] Alright#0419
if blocks are ever full, we will need to up the fee on dicefinish txs


[02-Nov-18 09:17 AM] Alright#0419

[02-Nov-18 09:18 AM] jl777c#5810

oh, so forcing a minsize forces it to fill it with zero fee tx?


[02-Nov-18 02:07 PM] jl777c#5810
what if there are not enough tx?


[02-Nov-18 02:08 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
min isn't `never build a block smaller than this`
it's more like
`if there are a shit tone of "good" txes, then this is the least size to put those that pay us`


[02-Nov-18 02:09 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so if only 10kb of tx, it will still make a block. i guess some overloaded syntax


[02-Nov-18 02:09 PM] jl777c#5810
I guess your options will the clear out the mempool? not sure if it will even add the 0fee tx into the mempool

@0x03 what is your problem with fsm branch?


[02-Nov-18 05:14 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
@forkwitch It isn't anything personal, the issue is your pool either isn't getting the full mempool or isn't processing it and since it has all the hash, any other pool has difficulty getting blocks


[02-Nov-18 05:17 PM] forkwitch#6080

[02-Nov-18 06:21 PM] siu#3920
That is the problem. No pool is seeing them


[02-Nov-18 06:22 PM] siu#3920
But now there are more pools, so maybe reindexing or rebroadcasting txs might help, which i cant do until tomorrow


[02-Nov-18 06:25 PM] forkwitch#6080
minrelaytxfee is amount of smallest to be accepted tx fee for transaction that you rely.


[02-Nov-18 06:25 PM] forkwitch#6080
But you can not set this to 0. This is not allowed because the free transaction are handled separate.


[02-Nov-18 06:26 PM] forkwitch#6080
It must be > 0. Daemon has one startup flag to relay free transactions.


[02-Nov-18 06:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
What happens is that the mempool is saved then cleared the added back, and  thinking its not enough of a delay maybe, and the mempools are forking


[02-Nov-18 06:26 PM] forkwitch#6080
limitfreerelay


[02-Nov-18 06:27 PM] forkwitch#6080
limitfreerelay can set amount of bytes your node will relay for volunteering in the network.

With transaction fee null.


[02-Nov-18 06:27 PM] forkwitch#6080

[02-Nov-18 06:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
That's all well and good but if there isn't enough time for the tx that's causing the entire mempool on jorian s node to propagate to his mode while his mempool is temporary empty so when they are readded they are rejected


[02-Nov-18 06:28 PM] forkwitch#6080

[02-Nov-18 06:45 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
I have a feeling that either the dealer node is totally stuffed up and not rebroadcasting the txes or something in the new changes is stopping it

Ill say it again, if theat dealer node has a tx in it mempol that all other nodes see as invlaid

the mempools isnt going wnywhere'


[02-Nov-18 06:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
These chains, have "mempool forks"


[02-Nov-18 06:49 PM] forkwitch#6080
Which tx @Deleted User , why dealer node does not remove from mempool this transaction?


[02-Nov-18 06:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
I have no idea... it supposed to clear the mempool on each block then re add it again


[02-Nov-18 06:50 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
@Deleted User if the explorer sees it, then nodes should see it


[02-Nov-18 06:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
but maybe that isnt working


[02-Nov-18 06:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
Not if the mempools are split in half


[02-Nov-18 06:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
explorer might not have the tx that invalidates the txs.. I htink the dealer sent all those atr once


[02-Nov-18 06:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
and its proabably 1200 txs that depend on 1


[02-Nov-18 06:51 PM] forkwitch#6080
Dealer generated and broadcasted 1200 txs at once?


[02-Nov-18 06:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
wqhen this happens I usually  have killed all node with stuck mempol to reset it


[02-Nov-18 06:52 PM] forkwitch#6080
I believe there is no thing as 'mempool fork', as it is not always identical on nodes with broadcasting.


[02-Nov-18 06:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
There isnt without CC transaction


[02-Nov-18 06:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
but these tx are diffrent


[02-Nov-18 06:52 PM] forkwitch#6080
Always you get relative memory pools.


[02-Nov-18 06:52 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
`'mempool fork'` aka 'P2P'


[02-Nov-18 06:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
Im not sure what else to calle it


[02-Nov-18 06:53 PM] forkwitch#6080
So you think dealer node has a dirty memory pool who is a problem for dealer node.


[02-Nov-18 06:53 PM] forkwitch#6080
Can we look into dealer node memory pool now?


[02-Nov-18 06:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yes I am theorising that its trying to send a mempool out (or has stopepd trying to send it)


[02-Nov-18 06:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
If I get a node with bad connectivity and txblast it


[02-Nov-18 06:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
all nodes will segment its mempool off


[02-Nov-18 06:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
and they tx wont go anywhere


[02-Nov-18 06:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
This is repeatable behaviour ... but if you hav a few nodes close together its ok


[02-Nov-18 06:54 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
that's simple to figure out, what's the addnode for the dealer node? add that and if you ban it, then something's wrong


[02-Nov-18 06:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
🤔


[02-Nov-18 06:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
Maybe we need to add a exception to addtomempool that just lets in all dicefinish bets


[02-Nov-18 06:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
then let the miner invalidate them


[02-Nov-18 06:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
that might not be a great idea though, as the DICE contract runs its consensus on the mempool


[02-Nov-18 06:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
and could end up with runaway invalid txs


[02-Nov-18 06:56 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
you're 1/2 on the right track, that's what I was talking about the other day with the tx "depends" being an issue with only blocking 5-10 txes


[02-Nov-18 06:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
Well when siu updated and restarted that node it sent 1500 tx at once


[02-Nov-18 06:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
then they didnt go anywhere


[02-Nov-18 06:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
Which I can prove happens on any ndoe


[02-Nov-18 06:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
if you send a shit tonne of tx at once, it just wont propagate


[02-Nov-18 06:58 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
_thinks 99% of the issue is this:_
```computergenie@debian:~/.komodo/KMDICE$ komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE getpeerinfo | jq '.|length'

I don't know what changed between then and now, but `maxconnections=380` should never yield connections limited to 8 peer limit


[02-Nov-18 07:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
It will only go over 8 if nodes activly connect to you


[02-Nov-18 07:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
you need to change MAX_OUTBOUND in net.cpp

Just using 3 or 4 tables over a few diff nodes would have worked just fine ... but oh hwell.

[02-Nov-18 07:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
ExtractDestination is a function insode komodod that takes a ScriptPubkey (I htink) and gets the address it was sent from


[02-Nov-18 07:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think becuase we have the possibility of orphaned txs a lot of calls are now looking for tx that are not there.


[02-Nov-18 07:38 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
all I know for sure is that following
`git clone https://github.com/jl777/komodo --branch dev --single-branch`
is a bad idea if you ever want anything other than dev (or whatever branch you pick there)
`git config remote.origin.fetch "+refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*"` does fix it though


[02-Nov-18 07:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
You would probably need FSM for this chain tbh ... doubt it would sync properly on master

its liek less than 10ms they are removed from the mempool for, but maybe thats enough to stop them propagating

the dealer node was running without the latest FSM branch fixes. we know that gets things into a strange state


[02-Nov-18 09:36 PM] jl777c#5810
resync the dealer node from scratch and it should work


[02-Nov-18 09:37 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no evidence for or against whether things run stable when all nodes are on the current FSM branch. for all we know it is working fine

i guess if all the dicefinish are completed, then maybe things are back on track?


[03-Nov-18 01:33 AM] jl777c#5810
i think with new FSM branch, dealer node should be able to keep up with 1 bet per second and fill blocks


[03-Nov-18 04:38 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`the dealer node has no transactions in mempool anymore`

what really seems to have killed the dealer was the txfee change if understand correctly


[04-Nov-18 05:14 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
All I know for sure is that it went from locking up blocks weren't full to wholly unplayable, not sure what part broke specifically


[04-Nov-18 09:28 AM] Alright#0419
is *vital* for that dealer to be running 24/7

if there is any chance at all, to fix it that will do it... otherwise bet the whole pot on highest odds and elt it time out, and make new tables.

of interesting note:
when my betting node has:

my mining node shows:
`TX_PUBKEY invalid pubkey
ExtractDestination failed`


[04-Nov-18 11:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yes CCduration no hashBlock means means it catn find the  transaction .. it was orphaned


[04-Nov-18 11:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
or it means the dealer isnt sending the dice finish tx


[04-Nov-18 11:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
If the pool is on a diffrent version, that has consensus changes, the tx that you send, that dnt meet what the mining node is looking for will be automaticaly purged from the mempool.


[04-Nov-18 11:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
I can tell you that the FSM branch on STAKED testnet atm, is definatly having problems,... the only chain in the cluster to do so. All other branches are equal to the getTransactionFix commit .

I'm not clear on the 'where you want to receive the new ones` bit


[05-Nov-18 02:52 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
@ns408 that means do any consolidation and moving to t_address(es) before the next snapshot

mine might be drastic because im mining

If you address changed drastically we will investigate and if we see that there


[05-Nov-18 04:00 AM] siu#3920
if so, then you should have a lot of block rewards, not won bets.

there is a difference between a mined block tx and a won bet.

and there is a finite quantity of block rewards from snapshot 1 to snapshot 2

[05-Nov-18 04:30 AM] siu#3920
Like if your address suddenly changes 30k coins balance in a day or 2 we will examine the trabsactions to see what happens. If we see it was because of fund drainage then we wont account for them. If they come from mining, no issue. And if they come from a transaction that has nothing to do the dice fund then everything is ok too.

once the new chain is ready then the airdrop and start mining the new chain

yes unshield before 27000

since the house address got corrupted by the changes in the code and the bombarding with spam txs, the fund is designed to give a player an automatic win if the house doesnt complete the bet

that seems fair


[05-Nov-18 11:49 AM] jl777c#5810
i suggested to extend it to allow miners to know about it and not waste hashrate


[05-Nov-18 11:50 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
the node isn't being "abused"
it's broken and keeps randomly paying out for no apparent reason


[05-Nov-18 11:50 AM] jl777c#5810
so the timeouts after the 26401 will not be counted, but mining to 27000 will be counted


[05-Nov-18 11:51 AM] jl777c#5810
the past spamming got the node into a state where it cant process bets


[05-Nov-18 11:51 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
from the 1st snapshot, it seems I have ~29k that "came from nowhere" at random 5-7 tx intervals


[05-Nov-18 11:51 AM] jl777c#5810
likely timeouts from 600 blocks prior

not sure why


[05-Nov-18 11:52 AM] jl777c#5810
once the chain migrates to the new KMDICE, I will investigate what is going wrong with the dealer node. it seems some sort of memory overflow


[05-Nov-18 11:53 AM] jl777c#5810
approx 60k KMDICE was obtained due to dead dealer node before the 26400, which is almost 2 days mining output


[05-Nov-18 11:54 AM] jl777c#5810
seems a decent bug bounty


[05-Nov-18 11:54 AM] Alright#0419
has ~half of that 60k :S


[05-Nov-18 11:54 AM] jl777c#5810
also with the new KMDICE please dont spam it until I find and fix the cause for the dealer node issues


[05-Nov-18 11:55 AM] jl777c#5810
normal betting should work much better with the latest version, but my guess is the overflow bug is still there

This is the other address, i believe this is Alrights address


[05-Nov-18 11:56 AM] siu#3920
Well, ok... this is the thing... new chain will have a dev fund

ok so is the balance of that address changing?


[05-Nov-18 11:56 AM] siu#3920
all above the 10million mark will be moved to chainmakers multisig address to be used for development and bounties.

define "spam"....
I think the *fastest* my script ever played was 1 bet every 5 secs (because it never confirms faster than that)


[05-Nov-18 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
chain is stuck, at current hashrate will likely take hours per block


[05-Nov-18 11:57 AM] siu#3920
but since there is no blocks being mined, txs are no confiming


[05-Nov-18 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
i think snapshot the current block, we wont be seeing new blocks for a long time


[05-Nov-18 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
spam would be any amount of bets that cant be processed in time


[05-Nov-18 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810

[05-Nov-18 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
17 blocks not really needed, close enough to 27k, isnt it?


[05-Nov-18 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
"spam" -> "overload"


[05-Nov-18 11:58 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`spam would be any amount of bets that cant be processed in time`
well, fek, for the last week, that's anything > 1 bet per day :trollface:


[05-Nov-18 11:59 AM] siu#3920
i think the only 2 addresses having most of the funds after the node broke where from @ComputerGenie  and @Alright i know none of them have malicious intent


[05-Nov-18 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
the combined activity of all the dicebet got the dealer node into a bad state


[05-Nov-18 11:59 AM] siu#3920
actually @Alright was the one who notified us and was helping us.


[05-Nov-18 11:59 AM] LuckyShadow#3212
better do now the snapshot if the blockchain is stuck, no need to waste boost hashrate


[05-Nov-18 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
with memory access troubles, indicative of some internal buffer overflowing


[05-Nov-18 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
assuming I can duplicate it, i will fix it tomorrow


[05-Nov-18 11:59 AM] Alright#0419
I thought it was fixed and had mentioned it to genie. Wouldn't have said anything if I realized it was still broken


[05-Nov-18 12:00 PM] Alright#0419
jorian had restarted the dealer and it started working for a few minutes


[05-Nov-18 12:00 PM] jl777c#5810
it could be fixed


[05-Nov-18 12:00 PM] siu#3920
the thing was that genie did 0.1 bets at 1500 odds... which returned him 150 KMDICE per block for the last 24 hours or so... which is quite a lot.


[05-Nov-18 12:00 PM] jl777c#5810
for a fresh node with the latest codefixes


[05-Nov-18 12:00 PM] Decker#3767
i think better to do all "spamming" tests on a test chain ... we don't need to do experiments that hurts house / chain on main chain.


[05-Nov-18 12:00 PM] jl777c#5810
the problem is that the dealer node went through all the bets with different versions running


[05-Nov-18 12:01 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, there will be a time for a load test


[05-Nov-18 12:01 PM] jl777c#5810
but when a small number of bets overloads, that is not yet the time to break it even more


[05-Nov-18 12:01 PM] siu#3920
without the spamming and the changes we would have not got to this, so i guess that is good in a way.


[05-Nov-18 12:01 PM] siu#3920
And we actually dared people to break it


[05-Nov-18 12:01 PM] jl777c#5810
I will also optimize the dealer node handling so it can handle totally full blocks


[05-Nov-18 12:01 PM] Decker#3767
we can easily launch DICETST for tests with the same params as the real chain and do any kind of tests on it ...


[05-Nov-18 12:01 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is good we found these limits


[05-Nov-18 12:01 PM] Alright#0419
Joker and I have noticed that if you use *every* entropy UTXO available in a block, you always win


[05-Nov-18 12:02 PM] siu#3920
although i think the ultimate breaking point was the changes @jl777c did heheh


[05-Nov-18 12:02 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
`which returned him 150 KMDICE per block for the last 24 hours or so... which is quite a lot`
1) it wasn't "per block"
2) I told you that I have no clue where it came from, so if it's from time-outs, or whatever, take the 29k back out of the 2nd snapshot


[05-Nov-18 12:02 PM] Alright#0419
like the odds are in your favor if you do that


[05-Nov-18 12:02 PM] Alright#0419
while true; do; bet; done


[05-Nov-18 12:02 PM] Alright#0419
free money


[05-Nov-18 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
the latest version should orphan bets, but clearly there are some load based issues, and running out of utxo issues


[05-Nov-18 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
is it that if all utxo are used up, the dealer node gets confused and doesnt see some dicebet and it times out?


[05-Nov-18 12:03 PM] siu#3920
What we could do is use these funds or part of them (the ones from draining the fund these last hours) and do an airdrop to KMD holders


[05-Nov-18 12:03 PM] siu#3920
that way we get everyone to give it a test in the new chain.


[05-Nov-18 12:04 PM] Alright#0419
sure


[05-Nov-18 12:04 PM] Alright#0419
is not many coins compared to KMD's supply though


[05-Nov-18 12:04 PM] siu#3920
If its good with you guys.


[05-Nov-18 12:04 PM] Alright#0419

works for me; I'm not out to screw anyone, got better things to do


[05-Nov-18 12:04 PM] siu#3920
i guess at least 0.05 or 0.10 for eachone is enough.


[05-Nov-18 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
110k KMDICE -> 1:1000 KMD would at least get people a taste of the KMDICE


[05-Nov-18 12:05 PM] siu#3920
@ComputerGenie im not assuming you screwed someone, that is not the point.


[05-Nov-18 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810
so 100 KMD ends up with 0.1


[05-Nov-18 12:05 PM] siu#3920
i just dont want people on the new chain complaining about this episode.


[05-Nov-18 12:05 PM] LuckyShadow#3212
what ahppen with they who have already kmdice in same address like kmd !?


[05-Nov-18 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810
they get more


[05-Nov-18 12:05 PM] Alright#0419
Siu I'd rather see it in a faucet


[05-Nov-18 12:05 PM] Alright#0419
as 0.1 for 100 KMD is nothing


[05-Nov-18 12:06 PM] Alright#0419
doubt many people will bother


[05-Nov-18 12:06 PM] siu#3920

[05-Nov-18 12:06 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
`i just dont want people on the new chain complaining about this episode.`

right now few people even know about KMDICE


[05-Nov-18 12:07 PM] LuckyShadow#3212
i think better do this airdrop after the dealer is stable, he brokes when played a small group of people, what happen when play a large group of people ?!


[05-Nov-18 12:07 PM] siu#3920
Maybe we can give the airdrop to holders with less than certain quantity of KMD


[05-Nov-18 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
with an airdrop, it will get covered in the main KMD media


[05-Nov-18 12:07 PM] siu#3920
that way it gets better distribution.


[05-Nov-18 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
or cap the amount send in the airdrop per address


[05-Nov-18 12:08 PM] siu#3920
that too... can be like the airdrop for chain... which was the same quantity per address instead of per balance.


[05-Nov-18 12:08 PM] Alright#0419
maybe just change the whole coin for the airdrop. I wouldn't mind seeing 20% of circulating supply go to KMD airdrop for example


[05-Nov-18 12:08 PM] jl777c#5810
that is an idea


[05-Nov-18 12:08 PM] siu#3920
The new dealer nodes will be more efficient... we will try to evade the errors we did in the first chain


[05-Nov-18 12:09 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
is it possible to omit a specific address from a blanket  airdrop? If so, please give 0 to RUdNzKNzsyebRdDoprrkDZum1PkGoMY4RP


[05-Nov-18 12:09 PM] siu#3920
whos that?


[05-Nov-18 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
likely more value from airdropping 20% than having 8 million vs 10 million locked in bankroll

Oh @siu just realized you want to do a snapshot from last notarized block


[05-Nov-18 01:04 PM] Alright#0419
otherwise someone can reorg it


[05-Nov-18 01:11 PM] Alright#0419
Can someone explain why `while true; do; bet; done` seems to produce free money?


[05-Nov-18 01:11 PM] Alright#0419
Almost as if the house has a tendency to produce entropy that results in better winning more often than losing


[05-Nov-18 01:11 PM] Alright#0419
so if you use *all* of the entropy UTXOs, you have better odds


[05-Nov-18 01:12 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
@Alright based on what I learned today, I'm thinking maybe the timeout thing?


[05-Nov-18 01:12 PM] Alright#0419
no, it worked while dealer was fine


[05-Nov-18 01:12 PM] Alright#0419
did a couple thousand minbets at 1 odds


[05-Nov-18 01:13 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
in the realm of statistical probability or literally every bet won?


[05-Nov-18 01:13 PM] Alright#0419
No, lost *plenty* of them


[05-Nov-18 01:14 PM] Alright#0419
but it seemed to win out every time I did it


[05-Nov-18 01:14 PM] Alright#0419
like reproducible


[05-Nov-18 01:15 PM] Alright#0419
always ended up with more wins than losses

[05-Nov-18 01:16 PM] Alright#0419
did you make that?


[05-Nov-18 01:16 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
sounds like you ended up with the odds of the "old" way?


[05-Nov-18 01:17 PM] Alright#0419
What I'm saying that spamming minbets at 1 odds seems to always result in >50% wins


[05-Nov-18 01:17 PM] jl777c#5810
if there is some sort of overflow, any sort of result can happen. all anomalies are clues


[05-Nov-18 01:17 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
and tony always had <50%, so I guess it evens out?


[05-Nov-18 01:18 PM] Alright#0419
yes, so luck?


[05-Nov-18 01:19 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
it's been over a decade since I've done odds math to any degree beyond 52 cards (it makes my brain hurt anymore) 😖


[05-Nov-18 01:20 PM] Alright#0419
the thing I found odd is that it only worked if you used up every available entropy utxo


[05-Nov-18 01:20 PM] Alright#0419
I did a blocknotify script that would do 10 bets each block


[05-Nov-18 01:20 PM] Alright#0419
didn't have the same results


[05-Nov-18 01:25 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
I so wish this were craps, then I'd know more about the implied odds to even know if it's luck, bug, or in the realm of "normal" possibilities...
I do know that the lower odds you pick is the more likely you are to win, so depending on *how much* 'seems to always result in >50% wins' might make a meaningful difference (52% likely meh, 62% likely issue)


[05-Nov-18 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
using up all the utxo maybe confused the dealer node


[05-Nov-18 01:26 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
or that


[05-Nov-18 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
it shouldnt, but if you could duplicate this, it is clearly a bug to be fixed


[05-Nov-18 01:26 PM] Alright#0419
maybe we need pow for bets?


[05-Nov-18 01:26 PM] Alright#0419
a single 0 on each end?


[05-Nov-18 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
no, might as well go to confirmed bet resolution


[05-Nov-18 01:27 PM] jl777c#5810
using mempool makes things much trickier, but i hope after the next round of optimizations and bugfixes we will be close to a workable system


[05-Nov-18 01:31 PM] Alright#0419
@siu can you create an identical test chain with identical dealer setup


[05-Nov-18 02:07 PM] siu#3920
An identical?


[05-Nov-18 02:08 PM] siu#3920
A kmdice identical chain with 15k entropy?


[05-Nov-18 02:09 PM] siu#3920
Why?


[05-Nov-18 02:09 PM] siu#3920
The context wont ever be the same


[05-Nov-18 04:47 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm working on `dice` documentation.

Is anyone around that can help me better understand what this is?


[05-Nov-18 04:47 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I have the existing documentation.


[05-Nov-18 04:48 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I'm trying to rewrite, and there's some missing info.


[05-Nov-18 04:48 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I have already used dice on a test asset chain.


[05-Nov-18 04:48 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
So I get the basic idea of cc's


[05-Nov-18 04:59 PM] siu#3920
Yes. What info you need or what specific question you have?

@Bryan_Beus


[05-Nov-18 05:13 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I have a few  questions.


[05-Nov-18 05:15 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Is dice designed to be used by itself, or can we use it in combination with other smart contracts, in a more complex dApp?


[05-Nov-18 05:25 PM] Mylo#8306
it's an introduction crypto condition.   shows a challenge-response mechanism, PNRG by getting part from dealer part from player.   2nd story here https://komodoplatform.com/tech-tuesday-update-8/  @Bryan_Beus

Tech Tuesday Update #8: A Summary Of Last Week's Development - Komodo
Komodo Platform is starting a weekly briefing on the progress the Komodo Dev Team is making. It's called Tech Tuesday Update. Here's another update!
https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/5mM-oiRXPZqjXgvgfZbbafJQt6TUjYRR-YWovzFebXc/https/komodoplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/tech-tuesday-update.jpg

and a live game.


[05-Nov-18 05:29 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
So, it is not designed to be used in combination with other smart contracts, for larger dApp functionality, correct?


[05-Nov-18 05:36 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
This is just a demo for new users, is that the idea?


[05-Nov-18 05:38 PM] Decker#3767
My personal point of view - is just an example of features provided by CC ... it can be used with other CC on one chain, but i can't imagine real cases of usage of dice cc jointly with other CC.

{Reactions}
👍 

[05-Nov-18 05:43 PM] Mylo#8306
It follows the informal spec of what it is set out to do.

For the moment it demonstrates things that can be done that are different to the other CCs.   Same answer can be applied to each CC.  They can be standalone solutions to that given problem.  oracles, gateways etc.

If there's a use case in the future for locking coins from other chains, sure gateway could be done - but as a reference contract, diceCC does what it does.

The entropy tx is another feature of diceCC i should have mentioned earlier.


[05-Nov-18 05:49 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Seems like the entropy aspect of dice is what we should be putting in the docs?


[05-Nov-18 05:49 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
here's the breakdown of the returned response:
```
"result"        (string)  whether the diceaddress method was successful
"DiceCCaddress" (string)   
"Dicemarker"    (string) 
"CCaddress"     (string)
"myCCaddress"   (string)
"myaddress"     (string)
```


[05-Nov-18 05:50 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Can someone please give me a description of what each one is?


[05-Nov-18 05:50 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
(ignore result, that one's easy)


[05-Nov-18 05:50 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I need a full sentence for each that articulates what it is, and it needs to be clear how each one differs from the others


[05-Nov-18 06:27 PM] Mylo#8306
result  is like all other rpc, e.g. "success" or "error"

the rest are smart contract addresses.
a cpl of those addresses are explained here https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/Mastering_CryptoConditions/blob/master/Chapter%2002%20-%20CC%20contract%20basics#L37
privkey for diceCC is here https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/FSM/src/cc/CCcustom.cpp#L98

I'd have to play it to make reason of the relationship between addresses, the player, the dealer the game.  I'm not even a KMDice noob, but i hope to change that soon

@Bryan_Beus 
afaik:
```
"result"        (string)  whether the diceaddress method was successful
```
```
"DiceCCaddress" (string)  is the address that corresponds to the dice priv key in the source code, but it has the dice eval code modifying it 
```
```
"Dicemarker"    (string)  is the normal address generated from the dice priv key that is in the source code
```
```
"CCaddress"     (string) seems to be same as myCCaddress for dice. But might be different for other contracts
```
```
"myCCaddress"   (string) CC address of the user (from the pubkey that was used to start the daemon which was modified by dice eval code)
```
```
"myaddress"     (string) normal address of the user (from the pubkey that was used to start the daemon)
```
@jl777c  please correct any mistakes from the above  explanations


[05-Nov-18 11:28 PM] jl777c#5810
seems fine


[05-Nov-18 11:30 PM] jl777c#5810
it would be possible to combine dice CC outcomes into another CC, the other CC would just have to have a dice tx proof as input, so it could be a more complex game that has some specific random chance events that are needed. but the purpose of dice CC is more to show what is possible, using a similar method a large class of other CC can be created, ie. challenge/response, deterministically provably random, realtime gameplay


[06-Nov-18 12:19 AM] jl777c#5810
@Alright there is no need to create a test KMDICE chain as we can use the original KMDICE as the test chain. I am working on fixing all the issues we know of, so when that is updated, then you can stress test the old KMDICE chain. I will be running the dealer node


[06-Nov-18 12:26 AM] jl777c#5810
it would be nice if one of the pools can remain on the old KMDICE so we can keep mining it, even though the coins are test coins. @0x03 could you delay updating until we get all the KMDICE bugs sorted?


[06-Nov-18 12:28 AM] forkwitch#6080
@jl777c if it is gonna be a new chain KMDICE 2, i can make forkwitch pool dual pool for both KMDICE version also.


[06-Nov-18 12:31 AM] jl777c#5810
yes it will be KMDICE2, that would be great to have pool for both!


[06-Nov-18 12:36 AM] jl777c#5810
would be nice if the explorer can also remain alive for KMDICE and a new one made for KMDICE2


[06-Nov-18 12:38 AM] jl777c#5810
it is just a test chain, so one pool is enough. KMDICE2 will need more pools though

how much kmdice1 testcoin u need to be mined more? make an offer and i can take a look how many miners i can put on it


[06-Nov-18 12:58 AM] jl777c#5810
no need, I already got some rentals that should hopefully keep the chain moving

yes, there are still some issues with utxo selection

will fix it after we verify it can survive stress testing

if KMDICE survives the stress test, it could survive as a chain


[06-Nov-18 07:02 AM] jl777c#5810
i sped up a lot of bottlenecks in the dealer node, but still for large amounts there is a problem if you win


[06-Nov-18 07:03 AM] jl777c#5810
the tx constructor is failing due to primitive utxo selection


[06-Nov-18 07:03 AM] jl777c#5810
but if you keep bets small it will avoid this issue

Without updated fix mining of block like this http://kmdice.explorer.dexstats.info/block/000000f19c5d5f3b0c69d787a8d669fd5256913b684fac37c91d81bc8c39494c was impossible. I saw that 183 tx stucks in mempool for a long time, when i saw this - i started my own pool and it was unable to send block with 183 txes to daemon with error "unable to decode". Now it's fixed, after applying this fix your pool software will be able to mine any txes length block.

yes


[06-Nov-18 02:27 PM] jl777c#5810
so the key issue to fix is that the dealer node is assuming what gets into its mempool will be mined, which is false assumption, it is the miners mempool that matters


[06-Nov-18 02:27 PM] jl777c#5810
so it ends up getting a bit confused as to what bettxid to complete, but really I guess both might need to be refunded in case of a conflict

it is catching up at around 3 bets/sec and i think it can process a similar amount from mempool, so 6 to 10 tx/sec


[06-Nov-18 04:19 PM] jl777c#5810

you may just be trying to use an entropy utxo that one of my nodes spent already

each dicebet has a chance of being rejected, even if it looked good at the time the tx was created


[06-Nov-18 05:16 PM] jl777c#5810
this is because the utxo are constantly being used


[06-Nov-18 05:17 PM] jl777c#5810
so if your sendrawtransaction doesnt work, it means it was rejected. this is a normal possibility


[06-Nov-18 05:17 PM] jl777c#5810
even if it gets into the mempool locally, the miners mempool is what matters, so it can get orphaned after being in the mempool


[06-Nov-18 05:18 PM] jl777c#5810
further, even if it got into the mempool and was confirmed, normal reorgs could happen and orphan an already confirmed bet!

dealer node now does refunds of dicebet reusing entropytx

[07-Nov-18 05:15 AM] jl777c#5810
i think dealer node can handle 500+ tx per block, still not quite enough capacity...


[07-Nov-18 05:17 AM] jl777c#5810
the TUI/GUI would need to handle "winning" the amount bet, that indicates it was refunded due to entropy secret leakage


[07-Nov-18 05:41 AM] siu#3920
my node still give error about tx creation


[07-Nov-18 05:41 AM] siu#3920

[07-Nov-18 07:09 AM] jl777c#5810
fixed another bug that could explain the problems


[07-Nov-18 07:17 AM] siu#3920
ok, recompiling again


[07-Nov-18 08:03 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, current version is a release candidate:
1. dealer node is much more efficient
2. entropy tx is automatically created to maintain 5000 utxo
3. large bets are handled
4. various edge case errors fixed
5. detection of the same entropy being used and in that case the dicebet is refunded. even in a nonattack scenario this can happen. a dicestatus where you win what you bet indicates it was refunded
6. smarter handling of auto-broadcasting

assuming it can handle multiple node stress test without getting confused and doesnt allow 51% secret reveal attacks, it just might be ready for production use. I estimate chance of KMDICE being able to be salvaged at 70%. The questions are if it has good enough performance using a single dealer node and if the dealer node can synce from scratch. I will do that now as things seem to be quiet, will post when it is back to the current mainchain. so get ready for stress test, but dont start it till I post it is ready

assuming it survives the load test, there are just a few more things to add, like refund validation, hash tables, but i think the hardest part is done. processing all pending bets in parallel got a 100x to 1000x performance boost

your mempool was feked anyways, CG, wasn't it?

maybe it is behaving different enough to affect sync...


[08-Nov-18 11:49 AM] jl777c#5810
do you have ubuntu node?

Btw I did 205 succesfull `diceaddfunds` transactions but it showing numentropy 62 by some reason

lol the err msg

{Reactions}
😂 

[08-Nov-18 11:54 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh hmm no by funds it seems I did only 62


[08-Nov-18 11:54 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
did they clear your mempool?


[08-Nov-18 11:54 AM] TonyL#3577
Have to double check carefully balances movement. Oh didnt know about this 100 rule. Seems thats why I wasnt able to fix tests today 😂


[08-Nov-18 11:55 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes @ComputerGenie and my funding script printed whole 205 txid to file


[08-Nov-18 11:56 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
having a txid and having that txid on the chain aren't the same thing 😛


[08-Nov-18 11:56 AM] TonyL#3577
Definetly


[08-Nov-18 11:56 AM] jl777c#5810
you tried a full resync?


[08-Nov-18 11:58 AM] TonyL#3577
I not understood yet what goes wrong. Script succesfully did 205 `diceaddfunds` and get txid for it but to mempool goes only 62. Will create new plan now and will track balances carefully this time


[08-Nov-18 11:59 AM] TonyL#3577
I have only 2 nodes in chain now synced from scratch and ensured that mempool are in sync (since I have troubles now with mempool syncing on latest versions and transaction mining node mempool may sync let's say in 15 minutes with other ones)


[08-Nov-18 12:00 PM] TonyL#3577
Even erasing everything from /.komodo/AC except of config and wallet.dat not helps - nodes usually still see different mempool


[08-Nov-18 12:01 PM] jl777c#5810
sometimes a rawtx that is broadcast doesnt ever get confirmed


[08-Nov-18 12:04 PM] TonyL#3577
And mempools not syncing again

Tried to create new plan but mining node don't see this transaction as well as some previous diceaddfunds ones


[08-Nov-18 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
what happens if you sendrawtransaction (for a few) on the mining node


[08-Nov-18 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
does it accept it or reject it?


[08-Nov-18 12:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Let me try


[08-Nov-18 12:06 PM] TonyL#3577
I'll try to send same raw transaction for a new plan which I've generated on not mining node

[08-Nov-18 12:08 PM] TonyL#3577
Generated new transaction on mining node - it's broadcasted


[08-Nov-18 12:09 PM] TonyL#3577
And transaction generated by mining node in mempool on both nodes


[08-Nov-18 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
thats the problem


[08-Nov-18 12:09 PM] TonyL#3577
But non-mining node still have tons of transactions in mempool while mining node have only this one


[08-Nov-18 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
it doesnt know about the inputs


[08-Nov-18 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
basically if even a single tx in a chain is missed, all the rest of the tx after that look invalid


[08-Nov-18 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
and it is the mining node that determines what is valid


[08-Nov-18 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
i would switch the mining to the node with the big mempool


[08-Nov-18 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
or you can just test on KMDICE, which needs a stress test anyway


[08-Nov-18 12:12 PM] TonyL#3577
I guess I'll need some `KMDICE` coins for it


[08-Nov-18 12:12 PM] TonyL#3577
Mining node switching helped yup


[08-Nov-18 12:14 PM] TonyL#3577

@jl777c that err that I'm getting has to be related to the mempool; I had 1 bet go through and then fail again


[08-Nov-18 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810

[08-Nov-18 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
why does it say null?


[08-Nov-18 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
null wouldnt decode right


[08-Nov-18 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
the hex decoded fine, my guess is you are submitting "null" as the rawtx in some cases


[08-Nov-18 01:05 PM] TonyL#3577
It's not a decoding - it's hex which It tried to broadcast


[08-Nov-18 01:05 PM] TonyL#3577
Actually first came hex, than error. This `null` should be from daemon printout

got that and then forked


[08-Nov-18 01:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Let me try set little delay between executions - maybe it's related to hardware limitation


[08-Nov-18 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
ba2db4051858acdad5c5c132577dabc27e6587a8ed306d5f5705ac79a3554787 is only 13 blocks in the past, but it is valid


[08-Nov-18 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
is your computer running hot?


[08-Nov-18 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
dont laugh, I had a system that had secp256k1 errors due to some hardware issue, my guess was overheating

[08-Nov-18 01:11 PM] TonyL#3577
I've set two 1 second delays: 1 second after hex generating, 1 second after broadcasting attempt.
Still getting quite much 
```error code: -22

[08-Nov-18 01:11 PM] TonyL#3577
When trying to brodcast such hex manually getting "missing inputs" error


[08-Nov-18 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
what if you wait until the txid is in the mempool?


[08-Nov-18 01:13 PM] jl777c#5810
what is happening i think is that you are reusing the inputs as it doesnt use the wallet and checks the mempool


[08-Nov-18 01:13 PM] TonyL#3577
Like a until previous one is in mempool?


[08-Nov-18 01:13 PM] jl777c#5810
so no need for a 1second delay, but wait until it ends up in the mempool


[08-Nov-18 01:13 PM] jl777c#5810
with some max time like 10 seconds


[08-Nov-18 01:13 PM] TonyL#3577
Yeah it seems to be like this since odds and bet amount are the same


[08-Nov-18 01:14 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe generate betamount as some random number


[08-Nov-18 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
or have 0.001, 0.002, 0.003, ... bets along with 0.0011, 0.0021, 0.0031 utxos


[08-Nov-18 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
so it would pick the different utxo for each one


[08-Nov-18 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
then you can issue N dicebets of different amounts


[08-Nov-18 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
then check to see which ones confirmed


[08-Nov-18 01:16 PM] TonyL#3577
I think better to do way like this since if I'll wait to much between bets there is a big chances that block will be mined and it'll be not proper "spam same block" test


[08-Nov-18 01:17 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, you could just accept a 40% dropout


[08-Nov-18 01:19 PM] TonyL#3577
Yeah test showing that even some crazy gambler will decide to bet 500 bets with same amount and odds in 20 seconds he'll able to sucessfully place more than a half


[08-Nov-18 01:19 PM] jl777c#5810

If I'm just incrementing bet amount it's making situation even worser (I guess my wallet just running out of UTXOs)
When I've bet 0.0010, 0.0011, 0.0012, 0.0013.... Just 105 from 200 bets were placed


[08-Nov-18 01:33 PM] TonyL#3577
So have to prepare UTXOs first


[08-Nov-18 01:37 PM] jl777c#5810

yes


[08-Nov-18 01:38 PM] jl777c#5810
amazing thing is nobody noticed 😃


[08-Nov-18 01:38 PM] jl777c#5810
including the time to debug, though maybe the crash is still there, it only crashes under heavy load


[08-Nov-18 01:39 PM] TonyL#3577
Should I continue? 😃


[08-Nov-18 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
as you see the issue with blasting a bunch of dicebets, the dealer node has to process the bets and also deal with the same issues


[08-Nov-18 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, node is running, plz try to crash it


[08-Nov-18 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
sometimes the tx doesnt go in the mempool


[08-Nov-18 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
sometimes it gets and error and a new utxo set is needed


[08-Nov-18 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810

how fast are the dicebets finishing?


[08-Nov-18 02:41 PM] jl777c#5810
from this side it looks like pretty quickly


[08-Nov-18 02:41 PM] TonyL#3577
Is proper way to check it from my side to get `dicestatus`?


[08-Nov-18 02:42 PM] jl777c#5810
yes


[08-Nov-18 02:42 PM] jl777c#5810
just immediately after you send the dicebet


[08-Nov-18 02:42 PM] TonyL#3577
Let me try


[08-Nov-18 02:42 PM] jl777c#5810
do a dicestatus and see what it returns


[08-Nov-18 02:42 PM] jl777c#5810
likely you can do it in a loop and measure the latency


[08-Nov-18 02:46 PM] TonyL#3577
```{
  "result": "success",
  "status": "loss"
}
0 minutes and 1 seconds elapsed.

  "status": "loss"

0 minutes and 1 seconds elapsed.```


[08-Nov-18 02:47 PM] TonyL#3577
Timer starts before`dicestatus` call and ends when response received


[08-Nov-18 02:47 PM] TonyL#3577
Most likely it's < than 1 second

Yeah, bc


[08-Nov-18 02:50 PM] TonyL#3577
But there using $SECONDS envinroment variable for time counting, there is no $MILISECONDS one

OK, not that I'm on the real right branch, I ran out of entropy and have an ass ton of

[08-Nov-18 03:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
There is some code commented out in CCtc.CPP I think k it is, that allows random choosing of local utxo


[08-Nov-18 03:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
To spam bets you will need to uncomment that


[08-Nov-18 03:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
Otherwise your bets will keep picking the se utxos


[08-Nov-18 03:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
And refuse to broadcast with missing inputs


[08-Nov-18 03:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
I will have a look where exactly soon... To make a lot of parallel bets you need that code, 5000+ entropy and 500 utxo in local wallet, and at least 3 nodes


[08-Nov-18 03:27 PM] TonyL#3577
`And refuse to broadcast with missing inputs` that's actually what I'm getting now when trying to re-broadcast not accepted hashes


[08-Nov-18 03:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yes I had at least 70% of bets fail without the random utxo selection code, but I disabled it in the official sources to stop everyone spamming the dealer as just 2 node with it could totally stop it dead before


[08-Nov-18 03:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
Just work up will post the location on it and make sure it's still there in a minute


[08-Nov-18 03:31 PM] TonyL#3577
I have 3 synced nodes with some KMDICE and spamming scripts on it


[08-Nov-18 03:32 PM] TonyL#3577
Just have to generate UTXOs


[08-Nov-18 03:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
```#!/bin/bash

address=RRoC3gu4cTgPsVSbYg1vFGbtcum8X7PPz9 # Fnode
#address=RU3yYGAz1xVjkLbeEdxKq5WpQNDdkYd83V # cc
#address=RGySymLoUMN4LEFFwCFSxo14GSJFvFjH8p # test node at home

JSON='"{\"'
JSON2='\":0.00001,\"'

for i in `seq 1 500`; do
     JSON+=$address
     JSON+=$JSON2
done
JSON="${JSON%???}}\""
echo $JSON```
You will nned this to build a sendmany to make enough utxo to make the random sleection work.

Just wanted to ask if there any ready script for UTXOs generation and you posted it. Thanks! 😃


[08-Nov-18 03:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
That code will skip utxos to select more randomly


[08-Nov-18 03:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
maybe make it activate lower than 500 utxo


[08-Nov-18 03:34 PM] TonyL#3577
```        //if ( numunspents > 500 ) {
        //    if ( (rand() % 100) < 80 )
        //        continue;

The entropy random selection isnt that good either, when I was testing there waslike 15,000 utxos with only a few hundred, it will ned ot be better optimized.


[08-Nov-18 03:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
Currently it randomly picks a number beteween half the total amount, and 0 then skips 90% of them... so only chooses in the middle, rather than over the whole list.

the dicestatus loop uses the same DiceQueue that the realtime validation does

mutexes to protect data structure

queueing and I will change the linear search with hashing tomorrow, but everything is all in nice little functions already

If so I can re-check RNG fairness


[08-Nov-18 05:39 PM] jl777c#5810
I disabled 1:1 odds for RPC, but we should really validate the fairness. i didnt change the RNG, but maybe something in the system changes


[08-Nov-18 05:40 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh it's not a big deal that there is no 1:1 since we have all others 😃


[08-Nov-18 05:40 PM] TonyL#3577
Will re-check it tomorrow


[08-Nov-18 05:42 PM] TonyL#3577
Now such test will be much much more faster than before because it's possible to place much more bets/minute

yes, maybe 5 million bets can be made in a day

[08-Nov-18 05:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
Its not easy to place a full block, with the utxo selection.. Even if your node has 5000 utxo to choose from, it wills till choose the smae ones somehow if you bet too fast


[08-Nov-18 05:47 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe something like dicefinish is needed. i allocate utxo for all the pending bets at once


[08-Nov-18 05:47 PM] jl777c#5810
so one iteration through the utxos and all pending bets have their utxo


[08-Nov-18 05:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
tbh who is going to be betting that many at once ... its mostly for testing the limits that we need it .. Normally a single node would be betting only 1-2 at a time.


[08-Nov-18 05:48 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe not dice but some other CC


[08-Nov-18 05:48 PM] TonyL#3577
Like a slots


[08-Nov-18 05:48 PM] TonyL#3577
In slots you may do like 50-60 spins for a minute


[08-Nov-18 05:48 PM] jl777c#5810
only the wins need to do the normal utxo scan, but at 1:2 odds, it is only one third the tx. I didnt bother batch selecting the dicewin utxo as it seems faster now than a dozen test nodes can blast


[08-Nov-18 05:52 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm just had an idea (not connected to dice) - make a chess game based on oraclesCC. Each game is a oracle, 2 players are publishers publish moves one by one - after game can check moves from it.  Will it be a good demonstration?


[08-Nov-18 05:54 PM] jl777c#5810
a dapp could validate the moves


[08-Nov-18 05:54 PM] jl777c#5810
when we get the bet CC, people can play for money

automatically creates 0.0002 utxos for the parallel txconstruction and also creates 0.023 utxo that are needed to fund the sendmany 0.0002
reduced CPU usage now it ranges from 1% to 20% maybe under stress test it will go up

@everyone Please update your KMDICE nodes to the latest FSM branch of komodo! A hard fork change has been done to the chain and everyone needs to update and be sure you keep on the right fork. If you hold your funds in Agama wallet, please dont use them until we have cleared all the tests and release a new version of Agama with fixed chain. Also if you were mining using a pool, be sure your pool is on the right fork, if not, encourage the owner to fix it or point your devices to a pool that is in the correct fork.

[09-Nov-18 11:38 AM] jl777c#5810
before we make special cross os agama versions, I would like to make sure it survives stress test and best to have all the dealer node changes too, so let us plan for next week to get FSM branch stabilized for a KMDICE release candidate

@Llama if you do want to mine, you can do so on my pool (kmdice.komodopool.xyz), it's up and running on the correct chain. you'll probably not get a working GUI for kmdice yet to manage your rewards tho


[09-Nov-18 12:06 PM] 0x03#8822
but if you're cli-savvy nothing should go wrong as long as you follow jl's instructions above, that would be 'use FSM branch'

@here For people that have doubts about the state of the chain or the snapshot. The possibility to stay with this same chain has gone up to 95% now. @jl777c has not finished debugging and fixing the issues we have, we will announce when it is ready for everyone to play. BUT, since we are inviting people to mine the chain again, we will do a new snapshot in the future JUST in case that we do need to change to a new chain.  Hope this answers any questions you guys have about the snapshot.

btw - i've noticed this while doing tests for veruscoin the other day on a testnet, the *nomps webdashboard isn't made to display the data it gets when it's actually 100% of the chains hashrate. for whatever reason that may be... payouts and stuff will be fine (they will. trust me.), it may just happen that the displayed stuff on the pool seems off.

@jl777c found 1-2 bugs
1500 odds is winning way too much and pays out as 1 odds when betting 0.99


[10-Nov-18 02:59 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
I'm assuming that the 2 are related - winning because it's seeing odds as 1 and that's why the payout is 1


[10-Nov-18 03:05 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
seems all 1500 odds are seen as 1 odds

@ComputerGenie if you bet 2 and get back 2, that means it was refunded

refunds are not a win and not a loss

it happens if you use the same entropy tx that was already revealed

Ohh right, refund indicating as win now


[10-Nov-18 03:30 AM] ComputerGenie#7004

so if you use 2 bytes for 129 to 255, it could be rejecting it, even though it is valid varint, it isnt optimal

btw, does anyone know if a build of KMD for raspberry pi exist?


[10-Nov-18 08:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
not PI doesnt have enough ram


[10-Nov-18 08:48 AM] siu#3920
ah


[10-Nov-18 08:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
ther is a build for arm64 though @radix42  wsa working on that


[10-Nov-18 08:49 AM] siu#3920
also, i was able to build mm in raspberry pi some months ago, now it doesnt build.

@siu offline signing?


[10-Nov-18 08:52 AM] Alright#0419
There's a project that uses 2 raspi 2s, one online for broadcasting txs, one offline for signing


[10-Nov-18 08:52 AM] Alright#0419
connected via io pins


[10-Nov-18 08:52 AM] siu#3920
but if i cant get kmd to run there....


[10-Nov-18 08:52 AM] Alright#0419
you don't need daemon to sign things


[10-Nov-18 08:52 AM] Alright#0419
nor for broadcasting txs


[10-Nov-18 08:54 AM] siu#3920
ok


[10-Nov-18 08:54 AM] siu#3920
but anything else?


[10-Nov-18 08:54 AM] siu#3920
any other idea?


[10-Nov-18 08:55 AM] Alright#0419
you can at least make it build, sign and broadcast txs


[10-Nov-18 08:55 AM] Alright#0419
don't need a daemon to do that


[10-Nov-18 08:55 AM] Alright#0419
can use insight api for necessary info to build the txs


[10-Nov-18 08:55 AM] Alright#0419
plenty of libraries for signing


[10-Nov-18 08:56 AM] Alright#0419
and insight api for broadcasting


[10-Nov-18 08:56 AM] siu#3920

the template manipulation is server-side, so it's not going to impact miner(s)

[10-Nov-18 09:36 AM] jl777c#5810
good news! The problem I had was that I made 100 payment tx to create a bunch of vouts for the parallel dicefinish


[10-Nov-18 09:37 AM] jl777c#5810
this made me find the bug that I wrongly assumed the vout for the entropy txid would always be 0, off by one in the vout/vin dereferencing

{Reactions}
👍🏽 

[10-Nov-18 09:37 AM] jl777c#5810
so to fix it, I needed to include the vout into the entropy calculation


[10-Nov-18 09:37 AM] jl777c#5810
but that would be a hardforking change and I didnt want to do it two days in a row

[10-Nov-18 09:38 AM] jl777c#5810
but, after analysing the code, I realized that only the dealer node actually calculates the entropy for the dealer entropy and that the players are posting their entropy in the opreturn, so they can change how they calculate it at anytime


[10-Nov-18 09:39 AM] jl777c#5810
but there are 7000+ entropy tx using the old broken way to calculate the entropy


[10-Nov-18 09:39 AM] jl777c#5810
luckily the validation uses the proof of hash of entropy, ie. the entropy used in the dicefinish tx


[10-Nov-18 09:39 AM] jl777c#5810
and the entropy tx includes the hash of entropy


[10-Nov-18 09:40 AM] jl777c#5810
so, the dealer side can compare the entropy using the old way and if the hash of entropy matches, to use that. if not to use the new bug fixed method!

and i am seeing this work now that we had a bunch of bets go by


[10-Nov-18 09:40 AM] jl777c#5810
so after a while the entropy collision will go away and the 51% secret reveal attack will be properly detected


[10-Nov-18 09:41 AM] jl777c#5810
all this was a pretty good test of the 51% attack detection


[10-Nov-18 09:41 AM] jl777c#5810
tl:dr spam the bets as much as possible and try to break the chain


[10-Nov-18 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
still have the dealer node optimization to make it go faster, but that wont affect any consensus, or actually any behavior as it would be an inplace change. which means we are down to just a few things left before we can consider KMDICE completed at the core level


[10-Nov-18 09:43 AM] siu#3920
ok, so we can bet now?


[10-Nov-18 09:43 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[10-Nov-18 09:43 AM] jl777c#5810

[10-Nov-18 09:44 AM] jl777c#5810
dealer node is using 5% of one core CPU

delete current chain data and resync is the ultimate way


[10-Nov-18 09:55 AM] Alright#0419
pretty sure the IP of node posted in chain params isn't on the correct chain


[10-Nov-18 09:55 AM] Alright#0419
so if you delete peers.dat and don't add an additional peer to start up params, you won't sync to real chain

Main issue is still sending enough bets from one wallet ... lot sof bet send failed... still its 100x better tha it was...


[10-Nov-18 11:09 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, before this weeks fixes, dice CC was only working if you were really nice to it


[10-Nov-18 11:09 AM] jl777c#5810
now it seems it works pretty well, really the only issue is two nodes picking the same entropy utxo


[10-Nov-18 11:09 AM] jl777c#5810
and it isnt a money costing issue


[10-Nov-18 11:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yes a better random selection will help there, my soution was very hacky and fast solution, doesnt really choose over the whole list of entropy.


[10-Nov-18 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
about 1% of the bets were having their dicefinish tx orphaned and even though I had handling in there for it, it somehow just got into a state of not making any progress


[10-Nov-18 12:20 PM] jl777c#5810
deployed a fix to just refund these as they are rare enough


[10-Nov-18 12:20 PM] jl777c#5810
so now need to see if any other type of bets get stuck


[10-Nov-18 01:20 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
@jl777c have you worked on dice since commit `17d91e14f1324edbd2385cfb02bd14c42a981ddf`?
Something before that and after `9841d2984e853a06ccc736cfa9d91e5b8405bbe6` broke something


[10-Nov-18 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
what is broken?


[10-Nov-18 01:27 PM] siu#3920
Reindexing break the chain


[10-Nov-18 01:28 PM] siu#3920
I posted above what the console printed


[10-Nov-18 01:28 PM] jl777c#5810
what about a full resync?


[10-Nov-18 01:29 PM] jl777c#5810
bets work for me and others, no problems seen on dealer node


[10-Nov-18 01:30 PM] siu#3920
Ok. Will try tp delete everything and start over


[10-Nov-18 01:30 PM] siu#3920
Last time i saw those errors it was in the dealer node


[10-Nov-18 01:30 PM] jl777c#5810
the problem is that there was a single notarization done on the fork by notary nodes that didnt update


[10-Nov-18 01:30 PM] siu#3920
The issue was the wallet.dat


[10-Nov-18 01:30 PM] jl777c#5810
if you get that one, then it wont sync properly


[10-Nov-18 01:30 PM] siu#3920
Ok


[10-Nov-18 01:31 PM] jl777c#5810
when all the notaries update, this problem should go away


[10-Nov-18 01:31 PM] siu#3920
Ok


[10-Nov-18 01:33 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
`The issue was the wallet.dat`
@siu will it work if I delete wallet and import or do I just need a clean, new wallet?


[10-Nov-18 01:37 PM] jl777c#5810
so the problems are syncing and not dicebet?


[10-Nov-18 01:37 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
dunno, can't bet if I'm 100 blocks behind 😛


[10-Nov-18 01:38 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe invalidateblock where it forked


[10-Nov-18 01:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
Only issue is sending enough dicebets still .. no matter what I try on a single node after a little while it just floods -25 errors .. likely need a bot net of 100+ nodes/wallets to fill a block. 😂


[10-Nov-18 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
I imagine I could make a betblaster


[10-Nov-18 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
it wouldnt need to be complex


[10-Nov-18 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
get the list of entropy utxos, get a list of your local utxo


[10-Nov-18 01:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think the problem is just that its eelecting the same inputs... I have a skip of 80% in the uxto selection in CCtx.cpp but its not enough


[10-Nov-18 01:41 PM] jl777c#5810
allocate enough for a dicebet and construct a dicebet tx, proceed to next utxos


[10-Nov-18 01:41 PM] jl777c#5810
the trick is to allocate for all the bets at once

[10-Nov-18 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
just make two utxo lists


[10-Nov-18 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
and construct a valid dicebet tx

mtx.vin.push_back(CTxIn(entropytxid,0,CScript()));
        if ( AddNormalinputs(mtx,mypk,bet+2*txfee+odds,60) > 0 )
        {
            hentropy = DiceHashEntropy(entropy,mtx.vin[0].prevout.hash,mtx.vin[0].prevout.n,1);
            mtx.vout.push_back(MakeCC1vout(cp->evalcode,entropyval,dicepk));
            mtx.vout.push_back(MakeCC1vout(cp->evalcode,bet,dicepk));
            mtx.vout.push_back(CTxOut(txfee+odds,CScript() << ParseHex(HexStr(mypk)) << OP_CHECKSIG));
            return(FinalizeCCTx(0,cp,mtx,mypk,txfee,EncodeDiceOpRet('B',sbits,fundingtxid,entropy,zeroid)));
        }


[10-Nov-18 01:45 PM] jl777c#5810
you just need to use a different entropytxid/v0 for each one


[10-Nov-18 01:45 PM] jl777c#5810
if you make it broadcast after each one is created, then AddNormalinputs will check the mempool


[10-Nov-18 01:46 PM] jl777c#5810
now if you made the bet a fixed size for the blast and premake the correct sized utxo, then you can change the AddNormalInputs() call to just be:
mtx.vin.push_back(CTxIn(txids[i],vins[i],CScript()));


[10-Nov-18 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
since you are allocating from the same array in an incrementing fashion, you wont conflict with any of your own dicebets


[10-Nov-18 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
really, that is all that is needed


[10-Nov-18 01:48 PM] jl777c#5810
just hinge off of funcid.E they are valid entropy utxo, so you can scan for them


[10-Nov-18 01:48 PM] jl777c#5810
in any case, being able to construct a valid CC tx is very useful as we really need to test making illegal tx and make sure the validation catches them properly

@Tylor zkFS dependencies are there under "Get Komodo binaries" heading following that link.

And yes, at the current state of development FSM branch is being bug fixed.
```
git clone https://github.com/jl777/komodo
cd komodo
git checkout FSM
./zcutil/build.sh -j4    <---if you have 4 threads
```
Use the command in the channel description here in discord whilst bug fixing is happening, maybe the node in the docs is out of date.   This will be updated once bugs are fixed for stress testing it.
`./komodod -ac_name=KMDICE -ac_supply=10500000 -ac_reward=2500000000 -ac_halving=210000 -ac_cc=2 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -addnode=5.9.102.210 &`

[10-Nov-18 03:48 PM] Mylo#8306
and you don't have to build master then switch, you can switch immediately after cloning.   master is just another branch, FSM is just another branch.   It is only a naming convention that `master` is used for the main branch.
no probs

[10-Nov-18 04:06 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
I do have a problem building mutiple komodod for mutiple asset chains and using the wrong one at the wrong time - STAKED vs KMDICE -- maybe should consider multiple folders? -- can I rename the folder after cloning or will that break the build?  i guess eventually they will all be master.


[10-Nov-18 04:09 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
or I could build then rename the folder --- and date it!!!


[10-Nov-18 04:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
another folder and launch from it for coins that need that branch


[11-Nov-18 01:26 AM] CrisF#3405
@Tylor zkFS  This worked for me
```copy compilied binaries from different branch into different directory and issue calls from there

Example: After compiling komodo using jl777 branch, use:

-------------------------------
cd ~
mkdir jl777
cp ~/komodo/src/komodod ~/jl777/komodod
cp ~/komodo/src/komodo-cli ~/jl777/komodo-cli
cd jl777
./komodod ........
-------------------------------

After compiling komodo using dev branch, use:

-------------------------------
cd ~
mkdir dev
cp ~/komodo/src/komodod ~/dev/komodod
cp ~/komodo/src/komodo-cli ~/dev/komodo-cli
cd dev
./komodod ........
-------------------------------```

That uses up a LOT of space .. it sfare better to do what the `staked` repo does and compile each branch then move the komodod and komodo-ci to somwhere else.


[11-Nov-18 02:44 AM] Deleted User#0000
I guess that staked repo needs some work, so you can use it for all chains really.

I think its best if you test this from mastertest branch of staked ... if its working, I will then make a PR to FSM.. Its not a simple job to merge it and I dont have time to merge it and test it all... The chain starts with the correct options on mastertest branch of StakedChain/komodo

staked repo is almost fool proof .. although it needs work and updating I admit .. it no longer needs the config.ini as I added setpublkey RPC to fix that problem, and Ive tested that a lot latley and its stable as.

not sure I follow why you wouldn't just have a hierarchy, work on the bottom and push up (same as james does for komodo)


[11-Nov-18 03:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
I dont think you understand why its like that, as it already does this... but making consensus changes on a cluster of chains, and pushing ti to all of them at once... seems very dangerous ... this way we cna update one chain at a time ... and if its proven working and not ging to detroy everything, we cna then merge up. It works well as long as I dont lose track of what changes are where.

updated dealer node with hashtables instead of linear search. now the CPU usage is 1% to 2% with about a 3 second spike to 25% when a new block comes in. of course under heavy load, I expect it will go up in usage. code is now feature complete, including 51% secret reveal protection.
all that is left is to find and fix load caused bugs for the dealer node

and btc doesnt get that many


[11-Nov-18 06:59 AM] jl777c#5810
but as long as dealernode isnt saturated, it can handle more bets per block. my estimate is that things can get to a saturated mempool and dealer node will still be able to keep up, but the bottleneck becomes the blockchain capacity. for normal betting this is handling a lot of end users betting


[11-Nov-18 06:59 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
150 odds is pushing close to 1:3 of "expected"


[11-Nov-18 06:59 AM] jl777c#5810
and in a cluster mode, it would be one dealer node per chain, so that allows to scale


[11-Nov-18 06:59 AM] jl777c#5810
I think if you remove the refunded bets, it will adjust the stats to expected levels

so if it deadlocks you can ctrl-C and see where it was stuck


[11-Nov-18 07:22 AM] jl777c#5810
if same entropy tx is used, it allows to cheat


[11-Nov-18 07:22 AM] Alright#0419
if dicefinish tx is reorged it defaults to refund?


[11-Nov-18 07:22 AM] jl777c#5810
so if it is detected, it is refunded


[11-Nov-18 07:22 AM] jl777c#5810
entropy is a single reveal basis


[11-Nov-18 07:22 AM] jl777c#5810
once you see the entropy, you can just calculate a winning player entropy at whatever odds


[11-Nov-18 07:23 AM] jl777c#5810
so refund is the only sane thing to do, as it is possible that without any evil intent you choose the same entropy tx that was already selected by somebody else


[11-Nov-18 07:23 AM] jl777c#5810
of course you can also do it with evil intent, but only the first one that is dicefinished is valid, the rest are refunded


[11-Nov-18 07:24 AM] jl777c#5810
at least that is what it is supposed to do

1 per second is nothing, it seems to be handling more like 20 per second


[11-Nov-18 08:43 AM] jl777c#5810
most of the utxo got used up, so it is taking 10 seconds per block to make new ones. during this time there will be extra 10 seconds delay


[11-Nov-18 08:43 AM] jl777c#5810
i stopped and updated dealer node with new algo that will speed up the creation rate of the utxo to prevent getting so low


[11-Nov-18 08:44 AM] jl777c#5810
realtime systems are quite tricky and everything needs to be in balance. the dealeer node is automating all the requred utxo and entropy creation

Just visually from my side seems that my nodes spamming as fast as before

num normal 0.0002 utxos.4453 < 7777 -> n.6
it was down to 500 utxos, so it is regenerating faster than they are being used up


[11-Nov-18 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
when it is caught up the latency will improve


[11-Nov-18 08:50 AM] TonyL#3577

@jorian I split the dealer function into two parts. one is the -dealer=1 node, and it processes the realtime bets


[11-Nov-18 11:55 AM] jl777c#5810
without -dealer=1, the node would be running the diceloop and it processes the backlog and ones missed by the dealer=1 node, it also generates the entropy tx


[11-Nov-18 11:55 AM] jorian#4555
nice


[11-Nov-18 11:56 AM] jorian#4555
so the entropy creation doesn't interfere with handling the bets?


[11-Nov-18 11:56 AM] jl777c#5810
if it is on the dealer node it causes the lockups


[11-Nov-18 11:56 AM] jl777c#5810
but it needs to be signing the dealer privkey


[11-Nov-18 11:56 AM] jl777c#5810
so we need one node doing the diceloop and the other node the realtime processing


[11-Nov-18 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
I cant get my single node to catch up on the entropy tx while processing the dicebets coming in, as it locks up

just got the dealer node running


[11-Nov-18 12:14 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a pretty strong correlation between dealer node not running and bets not being processed

then start the diceloop

[11-Nov-18 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
if you have a third node, just putting a shell loop doing sendmany100 would be good


[11-Nov-18 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
i think at the current rate of dicebet, it might take a dedicated node just doing the sendmany100

[11-Nov-18 01:00 PM] jorian#4555
it doesn't necessarily have to come from dealer node, the funds in sendmany100?


[11-Nov-18 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
i am not 100% sure the validation would accept donated sendmany100, 90% sure it will work

I need to try and work out the wallet filter/cleaner better .. if I can get that working with txs other than notarisations it seems it can be usefl here aswell.. I have been thinking about a new way to remove old txs, get all txs in the wallet , sort by blockheight and iterate backeards down the list checking for unspents, once you count unspents that equal the balance jjst delete everythig before this last transactio. Seems much safter than the current method I tried, which can sometimes leave a rouge tx that is spent as an unspent n the wallet messig things up.


[12-Nov-18 01:03 AM] Mylo#8306
Morning all!
So as long as I keep my node online I can set up a table/diceplan ?
If yes, is there a way to know how many dealer nodes are online?

do you need two (or more) nodes to run a dealer node that is under heavy use?


[12-Nov-18 04:46 AM] Mylo#8306
starting with -pubkey allows dealer node to do processing, and same -pubkey on 2nd node for utxo splitting.   no more required.


[12-Nov-18 04:46 AM] jl777c#5810
you need 2 cores, so it would be possible to setup a single server to run two instances

if you run a dealer node on KMDICE, you can run this on localhost and ssh with tunnel to proxy your browser to it so it all remains on localhost.


[12-Nov-18 11:57 AM] Mylo#8306
i'll have instructions later in the week (maybe tomorrow)

click on console link and generate a block.  only 631 funds left in this (test) wallet.
These are not real KMDICE ❗

@Mylo i think that this type of console would work great for marketmakers


[12-Nov-18 12:22 PM] Mylo#8306
totally agree.   it's next on my list after dice/oracles.   i think you have all the mm bash scripts.   we can collab if you want in a few weeks on it.


[12-Nov-18 12:24 PM] Mylo#8306
ssh tunnel and only exposing localhost (and if you really want, just start it when you ssh onto box) with browser control to mm RPC.    can be done from android/ios with the right ssh tunnel settings in your app.  and firefox plays nicely on mobiles for such things.


[12-Nov-18 12:27 PM] siu#3920
This is actually the mm killer app that is needed, a gui for marketmaking.

I think the segfault issue from my script is coming from the fact that it uses 0.1M of RAM with each loop

There is a big amount of txids which I've got by spamming script but they are weren't mined actually - for such I'm just getting (null on checking results screenshot below): 
```{
  "result": "error",
  "error": "couldnt find bettx or entropytx"

But on this call it's crashing by some reason

when we win... is it normal to receive more than the what we had bet ?

that's how betting normally works


[15-Nov-18 07:00 AM] jusoaresf#3291
tks
so bet * odds is what is in the bet...


[15-Nov-18 07:27 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
on a win:
if you bet 2 at 10 odds, you get 22 `2*10 + 2`
if you bet 2 at 5 odds, you get 12 `2*5 + 2`
you get the payout *plus* your bet back


[15-Nov-18 07:30 AM] jusoaresf#3291
yes... tks. cannot forget the "redeem" of the value we placed on the bet

Left my computer running for a couple of hours betting every 30 seconds.


[16-Nov-18 05:17 AM] jusoaresf#3291
Hi folks,
I need help understanding how to interpret the command outputs where 2 consecutive equal commands & parameters produce 2 different responses.
First as win then as refund or pending...


[16-Nov-18 05:17 AM] jusoaresf#3291
First example
```
$ ./komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE dicestatus KMDICE 5be49570c56d036abb08b6d084da93a8a86f58fc48db4a1086be95540d752d6f 25372d9f211b6e55b879371f62da530fbdf316c74897026c349bab56a3577e95
{
  "result": "success",
  "status": "win",
  "won": 24
}
```
in the sequence
```
$ ./komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE dicestatus KMDICE 5be49570c56d036abb08b6d084da93a8a86f58fc48db4a1086be95540d752d6f 25372d9f211b6e55b879371f62da530fbdf316c74897026c349bab56a3577e95
{
  "result": "success",
  "status": "win",
  "won": 6
}
```

Another one went like this
```$ ./komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE dicestatus KMDICE 5be49570c56d036abb08b6d084da93a8a86f58fc48db4a1086be95540d752d6f 4e208c87bfd333562bb3ad3ca5967d87038013b43e47334a51b4541133d208d2
{
  "result": "success",
  "status": "win",
  "won": 10.5
}
```
and then
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE dicestatus KMDICE 5be49570c56d036abb08b6d084da93a8a86f58fc48db4a1086be95540d752d6f 4e208c87bfd333562bb3ad3ca5967d87038013b43e47334a51b4541133d208d2
{
  "result": "success",
  "status": "bet still pending"
}```

So... we need to refrain to report as a winning? How long?


[16-Nov-18 05:21 AM] siu#3920
seems like you got a refund.


[16-Nov-18 05:28 AM] jl777c#5810
orphans happen


[16-Nov-18 05:28 AM] jusoaresf#3291
Yes, nothing wrong with the balance... it's just that same inputs reports wining 24 then wining 6


[16-Nov-18 05:28 AM] jl777c#5810
until it is confirmed, it isnt confirmed


[16-Nov-18 05:28 AM] jusoaresf#3291
so we need to somehow wait before concluding a win is a win


[16-Nov-18 05:28 AM] jl777c#5810
and even after it is confirmed, it can still be reorged


[16-Nov-18 05:29 AM] jusoaresf#3291
and when we loose too... I did not c&p but last night before going to sleep I lost just about everything and now the kmdice is still there


[16-Nov-18 05:35 AM] jusoaresf#3291
so... could we cascade bets then?
Say it says I won a bet. Then I bet that that win is going to stick after x confirmations... then I lose 😃


[16-Nov-18 05:35 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c  I still can crash the daemon by (reported a little above): 
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE dicestatus KMDICE 5be49570c56d036abb08b6d084da93a8a86f58fc48db4a1086be95540d752d6f ade06bfdd31515cd7672d4f9a042ee651713e543ca89914385ec913e56bcb9ae

if you can, compile KMD from dev branch on your computer and replace the binary in the agama folder

{

  "error": "cant find dice entropy inputs"

```
Might be a `regtest` problem, so i'll double check against a real chain.

@everyone We have updated KMDICE to the newest komodo daemon with sapling activated and @jl777c has fixed some performance issues that had been bugging us since some time ago. We want to give it a broad public test to see if it is working better now. If any of the testers could help on doing bets today it would greatly help us know if the changes and the update is working as expected.


[01-Dec-18 08:26 AM] siu#3920
please, update your daemons to latest FSM branch for better results

@SHossain you can also then use this script to get stats of the resutls: ```#!/bin/bash

total=$(wc -l < ~/bets.txt)
totalbets=$(echo ''$total' / 2' | bc)

echo 'Wins:' $win
echo 'Losses:' $loss
echo 'Bets still pending:' $betstillpending
echo 'Nulls:' $null
echo 'Total bets': $totalbets

[01-Dec-18 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
i think this script needs to keep broadcasting the transaction until it is confirmed, that solved the reliability issue of the dealer0 node


[01-Dec-18 12:44 PM] SHossain#0007
@siu please post an updated script with what James suggested


[01-Dec-18 12:45 PM] jl777c#5810
well it is probably not so easy to do in scripting


[01-Dec-18 12:45 PM] siu#3920
ok, will need to figure how to do it.


[01-Dec-18 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
basically after some bets are done, make sure that all are confirmed before doing another batch


[01-Dec-18 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
or invalidated


[01-Dec-18 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
by some other node orphaning your utxo spend


[01-Dec-18 12:46 PM] siu#3920
the stats are a very basic script that reads a file that dicebet creates


[01-Dec-18 12:47 PM] jl777c#5810
is dealer node lagging?


[01-Dec-18 12:47 PM] siu#3920
one line is for the bet txid the other is for the status output.


[01-Dec-18 12:47 PM] jl777c#5810
why so many pending


[01-Dec-18 12:47 PM] siu#3920
let me see, i just came back from buying dinner


[01-Dec-18 12:47 PM] jl777c#5810
dealer=1 node


[01-Dec-18 12:47 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe do a dicestatus on it, if it is lagging


[01-Dec-18 12:48 PM] siu#3920
i dont see it lagging


[01-Dec-18 12:48 PM] siu#3920
bets are going through


[01-Dec-18 12:49 PM] SHossain#0007
after @siu's last restart i ddint see lagging from my part


[01-Dec-18 12:50 PM] siu#3920
maybe if you change `sleep 10` to `sleep 15` you get less "bet still pending" results


[01-Dec-18 12:50 PM] siu#3920
some bets take a bit more than 10 seconds to get a result


[01-Dec-18 12:52 PM] SHossain#0007
ok

[01-Dec-18 12:54 PM] siu#3920
these are my stats


[01-Dec-18 12:55 PM] siu#3920
so 10% of bets are not getting a result in the first 10 seconds.


[01-Dec-18 12:56 PM] siu#3920

[01-Dec-18 12:56 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so it is just a bad stats display


[01-Dec-18 12:57 PM] siu#3920
yes


[01-Dec-18 12:57 PM] siu#3920
its a very simple script


[01-Dec-18 12:58 PM] siu#3920
executes dicebet, waits 10 seconds, then executes dicestatus to show a result


[01-Dec-18 01:00 PM] siu#3920
aah, i think i know what the fix can be, create a loop within the script to wait for dicestatus to get other output than "bet still pending"


[01-Dec-18 01:00 PM] siu#3920
let me get to it... will post when ready


[01-Dec-18 01:07 PM] LuckyShadow#3212
i made a program who make 100 bets and after verify them , so have enought time to confirm them...


[01-Dec-18 01:12 PM] LuckyShadow#3212
u can make a similar script who can speed up number of bets and in same tame u have confirmations for all bets...


[01-Dec-18 01:13 PM] siu#3920
Yeah. Ill see what i can do

If your playing lots, and dont have too many utxos the `cleanwallettransactions` RPC in by dev fork will work fine for all high transaction nodes.


[02-Dec-18 08:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
As having to rewrite the wallet to somehting that actually handles high amount od txs is just about impossible, I just made it remove transaction history in runtime,instead.

Not sure what we could do - but... anything that might be fun. Could you even script some game into discord and inv more devs in here? Up to you guys as to what your overall goals / most valuable behaviour is. But if you tell me I can try to help.


[04-Dec-18 06:28 AM] siu#3920
Right now the dice game is alive and well and working grat. Best thing would be to do some KMDICE giveaway for people interested in testing.


[04-Dec-18 06:33 AM] benohanlon#7045
How would they test? Is this purely dev focused? In which case do you want to be posting in bitcointalk or other forums to attract competent testers?


[04-Dec-18 06:34 AM] benohanlon#7045
How much KMDICE and how many testers would you be pleased to get? i.e. what's a win for us?

`How can I calculate with my ksol power ?`
literally the same as every other equihash coin...
```HashMultiplier="6"    #1 for sol/s, 3 for ksol/s, 6 for Msol/s
MyHashRate="1" # or whatever your amount is in relation to sol/s, ksol/s, or Msol/s
AmIalreadyHashing=false
if $AmIalreadyHashing; then
    blocksPerDay="$(echo "scale=8; (24*(1/((60/(($MyHashRate*(1^$HashMultiplier))/($NetworkHashRate*(1^$HashMultiplier))))/3600)))" | bc)"
else
    blocksPerDay="$(echo "scale=8; (24*(1/((60/(($MyHashRate*(1^$HashMultiplier))/(($NetworkHashRate+$MyHashRate)*(1^$HashMultiplier))))/3600)))" | bc)"

they're all 98% identical

just to then differ in sockets or fucking details that i bet don't matter


[14-Dec-18 07:14 AM] 0x03#8822
i mean you can get a 4 pin socket anytime onto the board when a 5pin fits as well... the fans are _exactly_ the same

it's the white paper of komodo, can i get the white paper of kmdice?

Oh sorry, not sure about that - @TonyL would know

As I know there is a website http://kmdice.bet/ and bitcointalk ANN https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5054800.new#new
I'm not sure if white-paper needed for a test-chain

@sg777 the whitepaper is cryptoconditions.info 
Means just a CC contract docs.
KMDICE as CC is all you need to read and understand


[26-Dec-18 11:10 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
The source code files also covers things,
Can check kmdice cc code in komodo code

Thanks @siu In general it's quite easy to install on Linux by this guide: https://github.com/tonymorony/DiceCC-GUI#installation 
There is no any "official" way of this framework packaging for Linux but can arrange it if will be a demand

[28-Dec-18 08:02 PM] TonyL#3577
@HenryChinaski You have to run a komodo daemon locally for asset chain on which you want to play
For example you can start KMDICE native mode in Agama
Then your config with RPC username, password and port will be in `%AppData%/Komodo/KMDICE/KMDICE.conf`


[28-Dec-18 08:02 PM] TonyL#3577
If you run daemon locally as IP use 127.0.0.1


[28-Dec-18 08:05 PM] TonyL#3577
Connection details will be saved to file after successful connection so you'll not need to input it again. 
Actually daemon can be started anywhere (that's why I left IP field). For example I have one node on Ubuntu VPS and can play on any of my PCs from same "account" (actually wallet) without daemon installation/syncing. But if you run it on remote server - additional RPC whitelisting by IP needed

has anyone been keeping an eye on the dice plan's funding? Just looked at it for the first time in a long while and it's down to 5.4M


[31-Dec-18 03:03 AM] Alright#0419
anyone know if it was a steady decline or was it drained quickly at some point?


[31-Dec-18 10:06 AM] siu#3920
When the diceplan died some months ago due to lack of enough entropy txs, and @jl777c worked on the code to fix it, he was able to claim the 10million KMDICE UTXO that had become the issue all along. So we resubmited the first 5 million in thousands of 1000 KMDICE UTXOS and will be funding it continually up to 8 million.  Then 2 million will be airdropped to KMD holders in the coming months, when we get a official GUI.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cee-lo
Cee-lo
Cee-lo is a gambling game played with three six-sided dice.  There is not one standard set of rules, but there are some constants that hold true to all sets of rules. The name comes from the Chinese Sì-Wŭ-Liù (四五六), meaning "four-five-six". In America it is also call...


[09-Jan-19 11:01 PM] TonyL#3577
Current Dice CC can't return random value in given diapason, it returns Win or Loss with given probability for Win


[09-Jan-19 11:05 PM] TonyL#3577
Actually I think "Dice" name for this CC quite confusing - since people starting to imagine the usual dice where you getting a random number in range after throw, but this CC provide only result - kinda "GambleCC". Actually a lot of games possible to make but with pseudo RNG on already known result GUI representation part (I've posted example of such implementation in #cc-dice - same way possible to make blackjack and other games) what players might don't like. On current contract only possible to build a game which provides RPC calls of contract (gamble bet with odds)


[09-Jan-19 11:52 PM] Meyse#0952
How do you mean "what players might not like"? If the GUI is good the players won't even notice that the result has been given already and the GUI just is a representation of that.


[10-Jan-19 12:26 AM] TonyL#3577
I mean that player might not like that blockchain returned "won" but he see "5" or "6" instead. If you're playing usual dice game your result is a number from 1 to 6 (each one you can get with probability 1/6) but DiceCC can't return numbers - it can return only won or lose with given probability


[10-Jan-19 12:37 AM] Meyse#0952
Ah right, but I don't think it matters, cause the player won't see the difference anyway. You can present the player a number, even though the blockchain just says "won". The player probably won't even care, or even know about this, as long as it's all fair. 
This can be done with all games, roulette, slot machines, whatever


[10-Jan-19 12:46 AM] TonyL#3577
Let's say you want to make blackjack. There are 52 cards in deck. You need to draw one. 
Probability 1/52 so you placing a bet do diceCC with odds 51 (1:52). You get a result "won" - which card you'll show to player?


[10-Jan-19 12:46 AM] TonyL#3577
Or you want to roll dice: dice have 6 numbers. You placing a bet with odds 1:6 and get result "loss"


[10-Jan-19 12:46 AM] TonyL#3577
Which number you will show to player?


[10-Jan-19 12:46 AM] Meyse#0952
Im not great with the rules of gambling games. But roulette should be easy


[10-Jan-19 12:47 AM] Meyse#0952
It doesn't matter which number you show, as long as it's the one that the player didn't bet on, your dice example


[10-Jan-19 12:50 AM] Meyse#0952
For me it's easy, for the user it doesn't matter what you show exactly. If the blockchain says "loss", you just let the GUI pick a random number that's not the winner


[10-Jan-19 12:54 AM] TonyL#3577
Best implementation of roulette which I can imagine on it will be very boring - player will be supposed to bet on one result only (number, colour,  dozen or something else) and no multiplayer is possible


[10-Jan-19 12:54 AM] Meyse#0952
I thought about the logic, you can do multiple bets


[10-Jan-19 12:54 AM] TonyL#3577
Since if you put multiply bets which have only won or loss results it's possible that conflicting outcomes will happen


[10-Jan-19 12:55 AM] Meyse#0952
No, conflicting outcomes won't be possible, you just let the GUI pick the number the ball will roll into, based on what the blockchain says how the bets went


[10-Jan-19 12:57 AM] TonyL#3577
I place bet 1 coin on number 5 and place bet 100 coins on number 6 - both numbers have same probability to come 1/38. You placing bet to CC 1:38 and getting result "won"


[10-Jan-19 12:59 AM] Meyse#0952
Oh wow didn't think about that lol, then you can only do 1 unique number maybe. Roulette has many options


[10-Jan-19 12:59 AM] TonyL#3577
And on some point diceCC RNG sense missing at all and you can use "traditional" RNG which you want to put into GUI and use blockchain only for payments


[10-Jan-19 01:00 AM] TonyL#3577
If you playing roulette all you want on spin is random number from 1 to 38, not won or lose - thats why I think for other games other CC needed


[10-Jan-19 01:01 AM] Meyse#0952
You can do red,black,even,uneven,and other number things


[10-Jan-19 01:02 AM] TonyL#3577
Yeah - such things are possible - where no need exact thing like a number 5 or Jack of spades card to evaluate other bets/things.
Btw odds 1:2 not working correct atm and disabled 😃

Where you can choose odds and place bet. Not sure if there any bounty for that but you may put some rake or commission on withdrawals let's say hehe.

the output of dice cc selects a number based on the entropy tx selected

i use the standard method for blockchain dice to convert the entropy bits into win/loss based on the odds


[10-Jan-19 01:31 PM] Meyse#0952
Alright so Ive made a mockup, picked the game from @TonyL with the cards from cc-dice channel. Let me know what you guys think

[15-Jan-19 04:42 AM] siu#3920
maybe your bets got lost in translation after the latest update.


[15-Jan-19 04:43 AM] siu#3920
btw, something that maybe many people here are not getting is that GUIs will be able to create many different game interfaces and will be able to set house edge themselves. So in this case KMDICE works as a infrastructure blockchain for many businesses to work on top of.

There have been many changes in the code I first figured out to make this chain acrtually work. It should handle far higher loads now. The mempool no longer orphans heaps of transactions.

[24-Jan-19 07:58 AM] TonyL#3577
Thats looks cool @Meyse !
I wonder that we even can use such client with full node on user side since there is no SPV yet. 
Agama have precompiled komodod inside and allows to start needed daemon in very user-friendly way so possible to use it like a "daemon manager" for apps


[24-Jan-19 07:59 AM] TonyL#3577
Are you using some code or it's only picture for now?


[24-Jan-19 07:59 AM] Meyse#0952
this is just pictures


[24-Jan-19 08:00 AM] Meyse#0952
why shouldnt this be possible when running the full blockchain?


[24-Jan-19 08:02 AM] Meyse#0952
this app will probably also function as your wallet


[24-Jan-19 08:02 AM] TonyL#3577
It's possible - why not 😃 
I just mean that realised that the most user-friendly way to make a full node is Agama


[24-Jan-19 08:02 AM] TonyL#3577
Like hub


[24-Jan-19 08:03 AM] Meyse#0952
ah you mean like a hub for all sorts of chains, running different dapps


[24-Jan-19 08:03 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh yes - this way no need to embed komodod daemon to each dAPP


[24-Jan-19 08:04 AM] Meyse#0952
i also had this idea actually, one big portal/hub to access all dapps that want to be on it or something. Sort of like a PlayStore or something


[24-Jan-19 08:04 AM] TonyL#3577
Just add chain to Agama and ask user to install Agama and sync in native mode


[24-Jan-19 08:08 AM] TonyL#3577
And in theory we may have separate chains for each game/app to keep it as lightweight as possible.
Casino can keep games chains in cluster and do a crosschain migrations when player swap - something like this.


[24-Jan-19 08:09 AM] Meyse#0952
it needs to be something different then agama though imo, functionality of agama sure, but very different


[24-Jan-19 08:11 AM] Meyse#0952
but yes, there needs to be a package for all these chains/dapps somehow. make it user friendly and easy


[24-Jan-19 08:13 AM] TonyL#3577

thanks man, i feel you, i would play this even though i never gambled before, just cause how it would work lol


[24-Jan-19 08:15 AM] Meyse#0952
and play with these coins that are different then fiat, its just a really cool experience i think


[24-Jan-19 08:19 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh yes, it's like a casino chips 😃 
I have some codebase for Python Kivy GUI framework + Komodo. If you have the high resolution pics you've used for this gif creation I can make a playable prototype

🔥 

[24-Jan-19 08:21 AM] Meyse#0952
and what is the logic for the dice game? choose 1-6 and then win or lose (odds5) ? add 1 more dice? (odds11)?


[24-Jan-19 08:24 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm, we may start from super easy game: 6 sides dice, player have to guess number  (odds 5)


[24-Jan-19 08:24 AM] TonyL#3577
And super gambler option guess two from two (odds 35)


[24-Jan-19 08:25 AM] TonyL#3577
And then proceed to cards


[24-Jan-19 08:28 AM] Meyse#0952
how do you mean 2 from 2?


[24-Jan-19 08:29 AM] Meyse#0952
like how would that work in practice


[24-Jan-19 08:33 AM] TonyL#3577
Should be two separate `dicebet` on odds 6


[24-Jan-19 08:33 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm but it's a good question


[24-Jan-19 08:33 AM] TonyL#3577
No, just one bet with odds 35


[24-Jan-19 08:33 AM] TonyL#3577
And then GUI magic


[24-Jan-19 08:34 AM] TonyL#3577
I mean player have to guess number on dice1 and on dice2 and he win only if guessed right both numbers
1/6 * 1/6 = 1/36
So we can just place single dicebet with odds35


[24-Jan-19 08:36 AM] Meyse#0952
right yes got it

Hi hi. Quick question: how are the random numbers generated for the betting results?


[25-Jan-19 07:03 AM] jl777c#5810
entropy utxo are created (with hash of entropy)


[25-Jan-19 07:03 AM] jl777c#5810
player selects a random one and attaches his entropy


[25-Jan-19 07:03 AM] jl777c#5810
both are combined to create the two values (entropy revealed)


[25-Jan-19 07:04 AM] Mick de Graaf#8098
Aha nice! thanks for the quick answer


[25-Jan-19 07:05 AM] jl777c#5810
so provably fair, immediately revealed, jointly calculated


[25-Jan-19 07:16 AM] Mick de Graaf#8098
Another question hehe. What if I place a bet  await the result and if I lose 51% attack the network to revert the tx before it the blockhash is submitted to the komodo chain? Would my loss be reverted?


[25-Jan-19 07:25 AM] jl777c#5810
if a 51% attack is detected, then it is canceled


[25-Jan-19 07:25 AM] jl777c#5810
but the first bet would stand


[25-Jan-19 07:26 AM] jl777c#5810
it is not about the tx confirming . or not, but the usage of the entropy tx


[25-Jan-19 07:37 AM] Mick de Graaf#8098

hey , lads . how many kmdice i expect to receive with mini z9 asic per day and how do i play this kmdice game . i did installed agama wallet and done all setting in kmdice ( syncing and validate pubkey ) now its said i can play from any kmdice gui available !


[31-Jan-19 10:37 AM] jl777c#5810
700ksols network, if you get 10ksols. that is 1.5% hashrate of 36000 coins per day -> about 500 per day


[31-Jan-19 10:50 AM] prigo#8525
@jl777c  that strange its shows network hashrate only 400k but hashrate 750k . so 500 per seems its better to buy on market than mining

**Attention miners! Should you currently be mining on kmdice.komodopool.xyz (or have kmdice.komodopool.xyz set as one of your backup pools) - this one is for you!**
Effective now, the main pool host has been migrated to `kmdice.pool-mining.xyz`. The port number for the high diff/NH/MRR port has been changed from 18888 to 8889. Please adapt your miner configs accordingly and reconnect as soon as possible!
Additionally, the pool is now reachable within TOR directly: http://fkusu6b4kuadebew.onion (if you're really brave you can mine to the onion host as well, it works, but it's not recommended)
The old infrastructure will stay online for about a week to not interfere with anybodys potentially open NH/MRR orders. Thank you!
BTW and the new pool website is https://kmdice.pool-mining.xyz

c'mon kmdice, I really want blackjack 😍


[03-Mar-19 11:01 PM] TonyL#3577
If someone can describe model by which it's possible to make blackjack game logic on current DiceCC - I can  connect some simple GUI like this: https://github.com/momo-ozawa/blackjack-gui. It shouldn't take much time.

I don't see any ways how it's possible to make blackjack on DiceCC RPC calls - maybe somebody else see


[03-Mar-19 11:07 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
because it's 2 numbers and the 2nd is higher or lower than the 1st, you can't
especially since the 1st is static based on odds


[03-Mar-19 11:07 PM] TonyL#3577
I see one way of cards drawing but it need very reliable and fast response from DiceCC (now result may be void and changes on next call what is not suitiable):
Full deck
1) Making dicebet with some not significant sum like a 0.0001 on odds 52
If first bet won you draw 2 of hearts, if second you draw 3 of hearts... if only 52th - it's ace of spades

on  next draw you do same but up to 51 and keep in memory that you have one card less now


[03-Mar-19 11:07 PM] TonyL#3577
And so on


[03-Mar-19 11:08 PM] TonyL#3577
Since its' without edge these "service RNG calls" will give 50/50 result


[03-Mar-19 11:09 PM] TonyL#3577
But it burns txfee on each card draw. Hope oneday someone will make a new VegasCC contract which will allow to create games (CC should combine adjustable RNG which returns random things from diapason/list + ability to create games and accept buyins  / make payout)


[03-Mar-19 11:18 PM] TonyL#3577
I think in theory it's possible to make "gambling-complete" CC on which will be possible to implement any game based on odds and payouts


[03-Mar-19 11:19 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
I agree, it could be done with CC; I just don't see a way to do BJ with DiceCC


[03-Mar-19 11:21 PM] TonyL#3577
Yup, I think the same. Just wanted to explain for those who are waiting for blackjack or something else like this 😃


[03-Mar-19 11:26 PM] TonyL#3577
DiceCC just very confusing naming for current contract functionality imo. People imagine usual dice - usual dice return you a number in range of dice edges. Current contract saying did you win or lose, it's something like a WinLoseCC


[03-Mar-19 11:29 PM] TonyL#3577
You even can't make usual dice (craps) casino game on DiceCC because you need to know exact number


[04-Mar-19 12:00 AM] jl777c#5810
there is a 256 bit random number between house and player


[04-Mar-19 12:00 AM] jl777c#5810
if you can generate the gameplay from the 256bits,then you can do it


[04-Mar-19 12:01 AM] TonyL#3577
Can I get this number from RPC?


[04-Mar-19 12:02 AM] jl777c#5810
i thought I made an RPC that displays the RNG


[04-Mar-19 12:02 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe I didnt


[04-Mar-19 12:02 AM] jl777c#5810
but its there in the code


[04-Mar-19 03:25 AM] Meyse#0952
if we can get it to generate a number between a certain range that would be amazing, we can add many more games to our dapp


[04-Mar-19 03:26 AM] jl777c#5810
it is generating a 256 bit hash, which you can extract many numbers from


[04-Mar-19 03:26 AM] jl777c#5810
especially if you make a hashchain out of it


[04-Mar-19 03:34 AM] Meyse#0952
a rpc call would be heaven that prints this number out


[04-Mar-19 03:36 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, ok, after the dicebet is responded to, but the current code will process it as a normal dicebet


[04-Mar-19 03:40 AM] jl777c#5810
the issue is that each games rules needs to be put into the consensus to enforce payouts for a specific game


[04-Mar-19 03:45 AM] jl777c#5810
so for each supported game, i would need to know the exact gamerules and then can make an rpc call that is the equivalent for dicebet for that game


[04-Mar-19 04:50 AM] Deleted User#0000

Thanks for tips on reusing the code @jl777c that’s interesting (re 256bit number, hashchain mechanism)


[04-Mar-19 05:58 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess a small bet can be made and then use the revealed secret for the gameplay. I will try to add the revealed entropy to JSON


[04-Mar-19 06:01 AM] Mylo#8306
So to shuffle a deck of cards, allocate a hash to each card in array of cards[52] then sort alphanumerical from the hashchain, using 256bit number as the seed?


[04-Mar-19 06:03 AM] Mylo#8306
Ace spade = cards[0] which is hash(256bitRNG)
2 spade = cards[1] = hash(cards[0])
....
sort.


[04-Mar-19 06:04 AM] jl777c#5810
it depends on the type of numbers needed what the best way is


[04-Mar-19 06:04 AM] jl777c#5810
and how they are used

@Deleted User no, the block template was correct. @Mylo use joker's knomp fork with disable-cb feature. It will work with any equihash assetchain out of the box


[16-Mar-19 10:05 PM] Alright#0419
if any pool was using joker's stratum, the chain would not have stalled

@LuckyShadow seems like you understand kmdice. I mined a handful of kmdice just so I could try this out hands on. 

Is there an easy way to get started with the cli? It looks like you're making bets with some kind of automated script as if this was a form of mining?  Is it fun slash profitable slash something else?

Hahaha. Touche @siu 
I mean the dischord seems quiet, not many folks in the mining pool, not much volume trading KMDICE on DP, etc.  I am curious if the community that supports this is taking a deep breath of sorts, or has moved on somehow


[11-Apr-19 01:03 AM] siu#3920
There have been some intents of getting a gui done. None seem finished. Sadly at this time it seems like there is no public outcomes.

Yeah I spent Monda evening getting it working with a bunch of handwritten batch scripts. Though i didn't quite understand all of the transaction activity... In addition to seeing bets won and lost I saw lots of other tiny transactions which I think equate to the "cost" of placing a bet...?

[11-Apr-19 12:47 PM] siu#3920
also entropy txs


[11-Apr-19 03:56 PM] dogracer#3298
Is there a metaphor that could help me understand the "entropy utxo" concept?  Entropy is just a random number seed right? I'm confused about why that is transacted as a KMDICE spend


[11-Apr-19 03:59 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
_doesn't use metaphors well_
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy>


[11-Apr-19 08:26 PM] Alright#0419
@dogracer dealer posts a hash of entropy in an "entropy tx", bettor selects an "entropy tx" to bet against, bets against it, dealer must then reveal this entropy within the "timeout window" or the bet defaults to win

Will try that out in my Ubuntu embedded into Win10 later @0x03 thanks.

Ok so my next question is: who is the dealer? 

As soon as I start the chain Does that mean I take turns being the dealer too? In other words will I somehow slowly accrue KMDICE just by having the chain running using the pubkey from my wallet? Or is "the contract" basically the dealer?


[13-Apr-19 12:28 AM] Mylo#8306
Dealer can be anyone.   Look at dice_table.sh in this repo https://github.com/smk762/kmd_pulp/tree/master/kmd_labs/dice

From my understanding, chips are for card games like poker. What about kmdice?


[27-May-19 03:48 AM] gcharang#6833
dice is just betting on a provably random number and automatic payout of the bet - all in a decentralised way
it is a proof of concept on which many other games where a "provably random number" is needed and no one need to trust anyone else can be built


[27-May-19 03:52 AM] LeX00#3137
Seems cool, does it mean it could be applied on games like roulette, sic bo or slot machines?

I use lite mode


[29-May-19 10:53 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
the same way you got them into a z addres, but backwards?


[30-May-19 08:05 AM] siu#3920
You cant use z addresses in lite mode

haha cool.  sometime this week i'm going through every block of every AC to get the tx in each block for a dashboard.   how'd you get CC vouts stat @Alright ?   i've just asked Q without thinking about it - so excuse me if simple answer

@Mylo I have terribly inefficient python scripts to do it if you want them

KMDICE took like half a day 😂


[10-Jun-19 07:52 AM] Alright#0419
all the other chains took minutes


[10-Jun-19 07:53 AM] TonyL#3577
It doesn't looks like scripts very inefficient tbh, more looks like as KMDICE is a monster 😂


[10-Jun-19 07:53 AM] TonyL#3577
2 million CC txs


[10-Jun-19 07:54 AM] Alright#0419
number above does not account for txs that had CC vouts but have not yet spent them

I made a small bet on KMDICE with 
```
komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE dicebet "KMDICE" "5be49570c56d036abb08b6d084da93a8a86f58fc48db4a1086be95540d752d6f" 0.001 777
```
then broadcast the tx, when I check the status of tx with `dicestatus`, the result is 
```
{
  "result": "success",
  "status": "bet still pending"
}
```
since block 519187, & it is still pending, any idea why or how to make it confirmed ?

I've built a dice smart-contract on Eth. before, it's not very complicated, so I think I should start doing the same thing on Komodo

[18-Oct-19 02:17 PM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
yeah, I was thinking about that too, but since KMDICE already has 3 funding contracts, I gave it a try first

1 explinantion in that time it was becouse my wallet have 1.5 GB


[06-Nov-19 10:58 AM] LuckyShadow#3212
i made another wallet, i start again tu use the script and i see again the bug

the balance dropped

[06-Nov-19 10:59 AM] LuckyShadow#3212
i identified some tx suspicious but nobody at that time investigated


[06-Nov-19 10:59 AM] LuckyShadow#3212
so i stopped to play


[06-Nov-19 11:00 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
maybe because you were as vague then as you are now?


[06-Nov-19 11:00 AM] LuckyShadow#3212
i was not vague i provided the tx


[06-Nov-19 11:00 AM] LuckyShadow#3212
i will search the log to reproduce


[06-Nov-19 11:01 AM] ComputerGenie#7004

about 450 but not this is the problem, if is a bug must be fixed
i bet 100 bets in a loop with amounts between 0.001 and 0.13 and odds between 2 and 1500


[06-Nov-19 11:02 AM] LuckyShadow#3212
so the balance dropped at that time with 450 KMDICE


[06-Nov-19 11:02 AM] LuckyShadow#3212
in that conditions


[06-Nov-19 11:03 AM] LuckyShadow#3212
so it wwas imposible


[06-Nov-19 11:03 AM] LuckyShadow#3212
450 kmdice lower balance with 100 bets with amounts between 0.001 and 0.13 and odds between 2 and 1500


[06-Nov-19 11:05 AM] LuckyShadow#3212
ciumete06/04/2019
o observed in 2 hours the balance drop down from 960 to 506 kmdice
i bet only between 0.001 to 0.13
so is imposible in 2 hours to bet 460 kmdice
a bet durring about 5 secs
i loked in the explorer and i see that strange transaction !

[06-Nov-19 11:08 AM] LuckyShadow#3212
so, if u calculate 5 sec/bet , 2h that means about 1440 bets with amounts between 0.001 and 0.13 so can't bet about 450 kmdice !!!


[06-Nov-19 11:09 AM] LuckyShadow#3212

a script made by me on windows

u suspect my script when this issue i talk about with jl777 jorian, etc and in that poin they see is something went wrong, and now u find the dealer node was drined the funds !!!?!?


[06-Nov-19 11:15 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
as someone who has written over 20k personal scripts, I find it impossible to operate on the assumption that any script (even my own) is 100% free from errors just because the author assumes it is


[06-Nov-19 11:16 AM] LuckyShadow#3212
i telled u a logical reasons , i gived u the suspect TX , i played about 6 months and i monitored all bets


[06-Nov-19 11:18 AM] LuckyShadow#3212
if u don't trust about what i tell, or u think is not logical, u can investigate why the dealer node drained the balance, i think is same reason why my balance was drined...


[06-Nov-19 11:22 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`u can investigate why the dealer node drained the balance,`
because you formatted the tx to do so?
because you bet 71.67930937 KMDICE through a bad script call?
because your script doesn't round the way you assumed it would?
and 100 other reasons that might be on your end before it even got to the daemon...

`if u don't trust about what i tell, or u think is not logical`

Is there any plan to fix it? I see there is huge potential on Kmdice. Its success would greatly show the potential of CC and scalability of Kmd's smartchain.

Hi, again. I thought after most of the issues were fixed by jl777, Kmdice is already playable, just missing of GUI. I was waiting for GUI to play it lol.  So the issue was due to CC-Dice not working properly?

I previously bought kmdice at DP and thought gonna buy more when it is added in AtomicDex. Well I'll still hodl strong this coin. 😅 

I have few questions here:
1) Can games based on probabilities like roulettes, Sic-bo where players' choice do affect the result be implemented?

2) In case of dealer timeout, could there be refund instead of automatically win?

Sorry for the long post here.


[24-Dec-19 01:51 AM] coolermaster#4963
@hereSo when is the GUI available? Or is this a dead project?

Looks like ill have to fire up my pi4 not a great linux user (total noob) but i will try......... Do i need my KMDice in a wallet to play, mine are on an exchange atm as cant find a wallet that supports KMDice. Any help or links to anything KMDice appreciated


[24-Dec-19 04:41 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
yes, you need them in a wallet where you control the keys
you cannot spend coins you do not own

H, everyone. As altsbit is hacked, all users have to withdraw all coins including KMDice but the chain isn't running. Ever since Chickenpool doesn't support KMDice, no miners mine the chain anymore. Could any devs mine the Kmdice chain, so that we could withdraw our kmdice?

When new cc-dice2 be ready later, I suppose Kmdice will be hardforked or get snapshot?  
I hope you can help out with the issues. Thanks alot in advance

😩 I did have high hope on kmdice. Its a colloboration project between Chainmakers and Komodo team. In the beginning, we've been told there will be snapshot in case the cc isnt working properly but been cancelled since issues were fixed. 
Supporters been mining and buying on DP/Altbits for a year. Hope you guys will still continue on developing kmdice when cc dice2 be released in the future. I think supporters wouldn't mind waiting as long as the project continues just like chips.

@Alright. Aw, I thought bets wasnt possible anymore. If the bets made by devs, I wouldnt mind you guys win as you guys deserved more. 
Lol I don't know how to become a dealer and blockchain coding. I wish i know :).

On the kmdice bitcointalk, I see the team are Komodo Platform and Chainmakers and ive been reading posts from Komodo news mentioning kmdice. So I thought thats the collaboration is real. Even Blackjoker and James were working on fixing the issues previously.


[09-Feb-20 04:50 AM] JKLGamer#8218
If there will be snapshot, I personally think devs should reserve 10-20% as dev funds as this project was nvr easy to start with from the beginning. Devs and everyone who worked on this project deserved the fundings.

so Komodo Team push on front a dead project in the newsletter? What's the benefits ? Encourage last interested people to buy coins from others on market before killing it officially? That's look exactly the same strategy used on Chips.

you can run the wallet native from CLI

Do you have a KMD address? you can send it to that it won't be lost as long as you have the private key for the KMD address  🙂


[30-Apr-20 06:14 AM] Oszy#5734
for later: 
```Download Komodo Ocean
Create a .bat file, enter the chain parameters above, start the wallet, let it sync
import the private key > access your coins```

@jorian so i should just let it die on exchange in few days when it shot down, instead of sending it somehow somewhere where if something happens with coin i can use it?

then you need to figure it out yourself, there is no support for kmdice here anymore

the address for KMD and KMDICE are the same, so maybe you can just use a KMD address and save the private key for that address, and then send the KMDICE there
