lua system fully done, writting some examples now


[22-Sep-19 12:59 PM] Slyris#2880
@ca333 Hey


[22-Sep-19 01:00 PM] Slyris#2880
Here is an example of a lua SDK system, all the features are well replicated, auto binding events to compilation, performance close to perfection for a scripting language. Enables you to code the logic of your game without recompiling, very useful in C++:

```lua
function fake_functor(id)
    print("hello from functor id is: " .. id)
end

function __constructor__()
    local table_type = {entt.entity_registry:layer_1_id(),
                        entt.entity_registry:layer_2_id() }
    entt.entity_registry:for_each_runtime(table_type, fake_functor)
    for i = 1, 10
    do
        local id = entt.entity_registry:create()
        entt.entity_registry:add_layer_1_component(id)
    end
end

function __destructor__()
    print("destructor pre_example_system")
end

function on_key_pressed(evt)
    print("we in")
    print("shift: " .. (evt.shift and 'true' or 'false'))
    print("system: " .. (evt.system and 'true' or 'false'))
    print("alt: " .. (evt.alt and 'true' or 'false'))
    print("ctrl: " .. (evt.control and 'true' or 'false'))
    print("evt keycode: " .. evt.keycode)
    assert(evt.keycode == antara.keyboard.space)
end

function on_key_released(evt)
end

function simple_functor(entity_id)
    print("entity_id: " .. entity_id)
end

function internal_update()
    print("pre_example_system update")
    entt.entity_registry:for_each_entities_which_have_layer_1_component(simple_functor)
end

pre_update_system_table = {
    update = internal_update,
    on_construct = __constructor__,
    on_destruct = __destructor__,
    on_key_pressed = on_key_pressed,
    on_key_released = on_key_released,
    system_type = antara.system_type.pre_update
}
```

@jl777c I'd rather ask it here, #üé∞‚îÉask-jl777 is public.

let's say someone made a game which has leaderboards, used blockchain as db. worked really really hard on anti-cheats etc. and top leaderboard time scores are like 7 seconds 8 seconds 10 seconds ... 

someone somehow finds an exploit which is not detectable by any written anti-cheats and gets a 8.5 seconds score. when other players watch it, they see that it's obviously cheating. 

in a normal database, you'd manually delete that entry and patch the exploit, done. 

but you can't do it on a blockchain db right? so only solution -not really fixing all the issue- I can think of is to make an "entry-ban-list" and use it every time game needs to do something with the leaderboards, show it or process it, it will be filtered with that "entry-ban-list" which needs to be released with a patch to everyone.


[22-Sep-19 01:41 PM] naezith#9757
can you think of a solid solution for this issue @ca333


[22-Sep-19 01:41 PM] Slyris#2880
I think that these are verifications at the level of the `CC` no? (maybe i'm wrong please let us know)


[22-Sep-19 01:42 PM] naezith#9757
`an exploit which is not detectable by any written anti-cheats`


[22-Sep-19 01:42 PM] Slyris#2880
Yeah, i'm waiting for the answer then


[22-Sep-19 01:43 PM] naezith#9757
but very obvious exploit to a human who watches it, because it wasn't thought before


[22-Sep-19 01:44 PM] naezith#9757
and this kind of a thing is not rare, it will happen in first month of the release


[22-Sep-19 01:44 PM] naezith#9757
people love to break stuff


[22-Sep-19 10:26 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe have a list of banned pubkeys that are written to an oracle from a list of reputable pubkeys


[22-Sep-19 10:26 PM] jl777c#5810
so on game start, load the list of banned pubkeys and filter out any high scores from those


[22-Sep-19 10:26 PM] jl777c#5810
whenever a new cheating pubkey is found, one of the reputable nodes, adds to the oracle


[22-Sep-19 10:49 PM] Slyris#2880
Hey @jl777c , who can add to this specific list of ban ?


[22-Sep-19 10:49 PM] Slyris#2880
The admin of the game ?


[22-Sep-19 10:50 PM] Slyris#2880
And also what happened if he ban by mistake an pubkey we cannot remove it anymore alright ?


[22-Sep-19 11:02 PM] ca333#0333
The `banned_pubkey[]` would be hardcoded into the CC @Slyris @naezith - so we would control this list


[22-Sep-19 11:03 PM] ca333#0333
Lets hope someone manages to crack the CCs and to cheat the gameplay - that's where this stuff becomes really exciting and interesting for us


[22-Sep-19 11:08 PM] jl777c#5810
i think you would hardcode the list of pubkeys that have the power to ban, ie. the admins


[22-Sep-19 11:09 PM] jl777c#5810
then use an oracle that these admins publish


[22-Sep-19 11:09 PM] jl777c#5810
make it a majority voting, so if you have 3 admins, then any can ban a pubkey

{Reactions}
üëç 

[22-Sep-19 11:10 PM] jl777c#5810
but if it turns out it is wrong, the other 2 would abstain, or maybe build in an "undo" ban command that requires 2 of 3, or the original banning admins pubkey


[22-Sep-19 11:10 PM] jl777c#5810
really it can be however you want to implement the system


[22-Sep-19 11:10 PM] jl777c#5810
hardcode in the source code the admin pubkeys


[22-Sep-19 11:10 PM] jl777c#5810
each of these admins publish an oracle of banned pubkeys


[22-Sep-19 11:11 PM] jl777c#5810
games would look at the admin oracles and update their ban list when the game starts


[22-Sep-19 11:11 PM] jl777c#5810
look at oracles CC


[22-Sep-19 11:11 PM] jl777c#5810
it just allows any pubkey to publish data


[22-Sep-19 11:11 PM] jl777c#5810
how the data is interpreted is totally up to the application


[22-Sep-19 11:16 PM] gcharang#6833
> hardcode in the source code the admin pubkeys

something like earlytxid might be better? this way, the admin pubkeys will be in the blockchain


[22-Sep-19 11:25 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, an earlytxid with the list of admin pubkeys, that works too


[22-Sep-19 11:26 PM] jl777c#5810
the idea is that we can designate special pubkeys


[22-Sep-19 11:26 PM] jl777c#5810
and these special pubkeys can post data that is interpreted in whatever way is wanted


[23-Sep-19 12:10 AM] naezith#9757
I have a friend who is really good at game hacking, he hacked my game many times and we fixed almost all cheats


[23-Sep-19 12:26 AM] Slyris#2880
It's a good idea @jl777c @ca333 But as a creator of game all those things should be simple and easy to maintains


[23-Sep-19 12:26 AM] Slyris#2880
example through a gui monitor system alright ?


[23-Sep-19 12:30 AM] jl777c#5810
makes sense. design a general purpose system, let it be configurable via GUI


[23-Sep-19 12:33 AM] Slyris#2880
Hmm we will discuss about that @ca333 When we will write the first poc meanwhile this time let's keep it in mind and developing the core feature of the SDK


[23-Sep-19 12:34 AM] Slyris#2880
Otherwise from an ecological point of view it's not cool to say that players will try to cheat a lot, create a lot of input on the blockchain we will just try to filter no? @jl777c


[23-Sep-19 12:35 AM] Slyris#2880
I mean if someone want to ruin something he will keep cheating and give entry in the blockchain that are corrupted


[23-Sep-19 12:36 AM] Slyris#2880
The admins of the games will have to deal with tons of unwanted data on their blockchain?


[23-Sep-19 12:37 AM] ca333#0333
agree - lets first focus on the SDK completion and once we move to blockchain integration we re-eval this situation and figure/concept a good global solution.


[23-Sep-19 12:38 AM] ca333#0333
`The admins of the games will have to deal with tons of unwanted data on their blockchain?` if it becomes a huge gaming community the Admins can likely nominate some Moderators - so `admin_pubkey[]` would be able to define `mod_pubkey[]` - as stated above straight through the GUI/Game. But yea, lets get back to this when we re there.


[23-Sep-19 12:41 AM] jl777c#5810
i just answered the specific question about blocking a specific high score that cheated


[23-Sep-19 12:41 AM] jl777c#5810
of course it is best to blockchain enforce all things, so there can be no cheating


[23-Sep-19 12:41 AM] jl777c#5810
and the assumption is that new releases are made to block at the validation each new type of cheat


[23-Sep-19 12:41 AM] naezith#9757
what's oracle btw


[23-Sep-19 12:42 AM] jl777c#5810
so the blocklist wont be growing forever, unless the cheating cant be stopped. in which case there is a totally different issue

yeah it's good


[24-Sep-19 02:08 AM] Slyris#2880
you can build using make

```make[2]: Leaving directory '/home/tony/antara-gaming-sdk/build'

``` yay, looks like now I got the SDK hehe


[24-Sep-19 02:15 AM] Slyris#2880
normaly you have a binary that you can launch


[24-Sep-19 02:15 AM] Slyris#2880
in the build directory


[24-Sep-19 02:15 AM] Slyris#2880

[01-Oct-19 04:02 PM] naezith#9757
I can change if you find a better alternative


[01-Oct-19 04:03 PM] naezith#9757
most of the sounds there are aggressive


[01-Oct-19 04:03 PM] naezith#9757
hard to find soft and smooth ones


[01-Oct-19 04:07 PM] Slyris#2880
i like it


[01-Oct-19 04:24 PM] ca333#0333
@naezith agree - this one can be improved. Lets try something more "laser" style - i think it would fit better.


[01-Oct-19 04:26 PM] naezith#9757
laser ones are being sharp mostly


[01-Oct-19 04:26 PM] naezith#9757
I'll check though


[01-Oct-19 04:27 PM] naezith#9757
you guys can send sfx links btw


[01-Oct-19 04:27 PM] ca333#0333
@Audo ^ - can you please provide us the intro animations that we already have - maybe we can reuse elements.


[01-Oct-19 04:31 PM] ca333#0333
for now lets not spend any significant time on this - an alternative with "laser sound" in addition to the already provided one is good enough. We can/will get this done by external/3rd parties once the SDK has the key layers done. i.e. we wouldn't want to paint a car and mount the sound-system while the engine is not integrated.

[02-Oct-19 01:56 AM] Slyris#2880
@Audo  @naezith Yeah but this is a video, it's hard to scale for all resolution, the intro from naezith is 100% code, he can try to reproduce this one but i dont think it's the most important part of the project right now


[02-Oct-19 01:56 AM] Slyris#2880
@ca333 cc


[02-Oct-19 02:00 AM] ca333#0333
the sounds is A+ on this one - @Audo can you provide us the sound-sequences?


[02-Oct-19 02:00 AM] ca333#0333
yea as aforementioned for we don't invest any significant time on artwork, gfx, sfx, etc. (for now)


[02-Oct-19 02:02 AM] naezith#9757
that flashy white effects in the start are not very doable at basic 2D engine


[02-Oct-19 02:02 AM] Slyris#2880
yeah just saying that if we need an intro we will code it


[02-Oct-19 02:02 AM] naezith#9757
but the rest are doable


[02-Oct-19 02:02 AM] Slyris#2880
cannot play video right now


[02-Oct-19 02:03 AM] Slyris#2880
Using video as an intro for videogames is unfortunately not really scalable for obvious reason


[02-Oct-19 02:04 AM] Slyris#2880
but i agree that the intro is insane


[02-Oct-19 02:05 AM] ca333#0333
we could still have it ported to an animation eventually once the 3D layer is integrated - for now 2D placeholder is good enough


[02-Oct-19 02:05 AM] ca333#0333
happy coding!

[04-Oct-19 12:50 AM] TonyL#3577
There is no any disclaimer that in example on video you've built application on Mac, so probably some users might be confused (-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/local/opt/llvm@8/bin/clang++)
Also not very comfortable to copy text from this live code-video, but probably that is subjective thing


[04-Oct-19 12:50 AM] TonyL#3577
I follwed guide and have `my_game_project` binary. Is it expected that it do nothing on execution (even no black window now)?


[04-Oct-19 02:02 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah @TonyL  it's expected


[04-Oct-19 02:02 AM] Slyris#2880
As I say in the tutorial you should read the getting started page


[04-Oct-19 02:02 AM] Slyris#2880
Which indicates how to build the project


[04-Oct-19 02:03 AM] Slyris#2880
That's why the video is not for copying build instructions


[04-Oct-19 02:03 AM] Slyris#2880
Depends from your platform


[04-Oct-19 02:03 AM] Slyris#2880
According to the getting started


[04-Oct-19 02:03 AM] Slyris#2880
Is this unclear @TonyL  ?


[04-Oct-19 02:05 AM] TonyL#3577
I was able to follow this guide


[04-Oct-19 02:06 AM] TonyL#3577
Just shared my concerns


[04-Oct-19 02:07 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah but if you feel unclear about the build instructions may be we can improve


[04-Oct-19 02:23 AM] Slyris#2880

@Slyris so I've excuted ` cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/clang++-8 ../` first, then `make`. Seems it completed fine: ```[100%] Linking CXX static library libantara_world_shared_sources.a

You can also use: -DBUILD_WITH_APPIMAGE=ON if you want a single appimage binary

[07-Oct-19 04:34 AM] TonyL#3577
path above is not easy to find if you don't know in advance


[07-Oct-19 04:34 AM] TonyL#3577
oh ok


[07-Oct-19 04:34 AM] Slyris#2880
But usually as an external user


[07-Oct-19 04:34 AM] Slyris#2880
you will build as an appimage


[07-Oct-19 04:34 AM] Slyris#2880
which is easier


[07-Oct-19 04:35 AM] TonyL#3577
tictactoe works fine on my side until I resize the window


[07-Oct-19 04:35 AM] TonyL#3577
as soon as I resize the window from default size I'm not able to interact with squares


[07-Oct-19 04:35 AM] Slyris#2880
Ah i know why


[07-Oct-19 04:36 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah i will fix that


[07-Oct-19 04:36 AM] Slyris#2880
great


[07-Oct-19 04:36 AM] Slyris#2880
so it's work


[07-Oct-19 04:36 AM] Slyris#2880
mostly

in few day's you will be able to code your own tic tac toe in lua if you want @TonyL


[07-Oct-19 04:38 AM] Slyris#2880
I plan also python support but in few months

[14-Oct-19 10:35 AM] Slyris#2880
dont forget to pull


[14-Oct-19 10:35 AM] Slyris#2880

what is the difference between these two?


[14-Oct-19 11:00 AM] Slyris#2880
What is written in lua


[14-Oct-19 11:00 AM] Slyris#2880

[14-Oct-19 11:50 AM] TonyL#3577
`stretch` working same way as fit it seems


[14-Oct-19 11:50 AM] Slyris#2880
NOT POSSIBLU


[14-Oct-19 11:52 AM] Slyris#2880

[14-Oct-19 11:54 AM] Slyris#2880
y


[14-Oct-19 11:55 AM] Slyris#2880
Stretch change the pixel resolution


[14-Oct-19 11:55 AM] Slyris#2880
Fit, just fit the size of the window but keep original size


[14-Oct-19 11:55 AM] Slyris#2880
in a box


[14-Oct-19 11:57 AM] TonyL#3577
I see, on stretch I can make square shape cells


[14-Oct-19 11:57 AM] Slyris#2880

my friend


[14-Oct-19 11:57 AM] Slyris#2880
i think for you you will prefer look at the lua implementation


[14-Oct-19 11:57 AM] Slyris#2880
because it's more simpler to write game this way


[14-Oct-19 11:58 AM] Slyris#2880
In few days/week you will be able to write your own game may be :p


[14-Oct-19 11:58 AM] Slyris#2880
(probably not in c++) but in lua why not

hello @TonyL


[16-Oct-19 08:03 AM] Slyris#2880
I have a question


[16-Oct-19 08:05 AM] Slyris#2880
I will cut the tutorials into steps, in each step there will be the code of the step of the tutorial in progress, I finished the first step of the tic-tac-toe tutorial code and would like to hear your opinion


[16-Oct-19 08:05 AM] Slyris#2880
```cpp

#include <antara/gaming/world/world.app.hpp>
#include <antara/gaming/sfml/graphic.system.hpp>
#include <antara/gaming/sfml/input.system.hpp>

//! For convenience
using namespace antara::gaming;

//! Our game world
struct tic_tac_toe_world : world::app
{
    //! Our game entry point
    tic_tac_toe_world() noexcept
    {
        //! Here we load our graphical system
        auto &graphic_system = this->system_manager_.create_system<sfml::graphic_system>();

        //! Here we load our input system with the window from the graphical system
        this->system_manager_.create_system<sfml::input_system>(graphic_system.get_window());
    }
};

int main()
{
    //! Here we declare our world
    tic_tac_toe_world game;

    //! Here we run the game
    return game.run();
}
```
This snippet of code allows you to open a window and have the input of the keyboard, do you find the code clear enough, even without being very strong in C++?


[16-Oct-19 08:06 AM] Slyris#2880
cc @ca333 If you think this code is difficult let me know !


[16-Oct-19 08:12 AM] ca333#0333
looks pretty simple @Slyris - i assume that in the future we ll be able to initialize it like:
`this->system_manager_.create_system<sdl::graphic_system>()` or even `this->system_manager_.create_system<unity::graphic_system>()`which would "automagically" switch the gaming-engine/lib - correct? If yes, then this looks indeed very clear and simple.


[16-Oct-19 08:12 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah :p


[16-Oct-19 08:12 AM] Slyris#2880
exactly.


[16-Oct-19 08:12 AM] ca333#0333
excellent!


[16-Oct-19 08:13 AM] ca333#0333
and code reads really good - i.e. self-explanatory - i like this - keep it up!

@here Hello,

We are not very far from having something presentable, after more than 100 pull request, 20k lines of codes, and more than 150 commits in 1 month we are almost there, we are finishing the last part of the tutorial Tic tac toe, we try to refine a maximum documentation to make it clear.

it would be cool to be able to do some `qa-testing` this week if possible !

we ll look into it and run a test-session during the weekend 
cc: @TonyL


[21-Oct-19 03:16 AM] ca333#0333
fyi - i ve already read the tutorial which is straight forward, clear and simple - we ll just have it proofread and edited before releasing it to the wider public. 

Now in order to get (young) devs a little bit deeper into it - can you please create another simple reference and tutorial for a game where a user would use the keyboard for a "movement" input - i.e. drawing an object and moving it around in the game-scene? Just to get people into the game-loop logic of drawing/deleting/drawing objects in order to move them on the game-scene, etc. We could use a simple remake of Snake or Tron. This would teach them many things besides the drawing/moving logic but also essential things such as collision detection and multi-input. 
@Slyris @naezith - lets get this done this week so that we can run a full test this weekend in order to release the (pre-)alpha next week.


[21-Oct-19 03:17 AM] Slyris#2880
@naezith Will take care of writting a flappy birds this week


[21-Oct-19 03:17 AM] Slyris#2880
@ca333


[21-Oct-19 03:18 AM] Slyris#2880
For the collision detection for the moment we dont have lot of things , but plan to adding basics box's collision detection, latter we will work on the proper box2d wrapper.


[21-Oct-19 03:20 AM] Slyris#2880
What i plan for collision is: basic box collisions + quadtree + dynamic tree, and latter a Complete box2d wrapper that can take some time to write.


[21-Oct-19 03:20 AM] ca333#0333
ok great - flappy bird is a great and simple example too - looking forward to that tutorial. 
request: please use a pengiun in a matrix suit and green glasses instead of the lame bird :troll_cool:

I think at the release of the SDK the best thing we can do is a kind of global game jam but with the rule of using the SDK, it would allow us to discover the bugs faster and design problems if it there is. Can we give a Komodo reward to the winner of the game jam?

@here ^


[21-Oct-19 03:52 AM] Slyris#2880
Instead of doing it on a single weekend, we could organize it over a week to cover the maximum of problems


[21-Oct-19 03:56 AM] naezith#9757
good idea


[21-Oct-19 04:01 AM] Slyris#2880
@TonyL https://antara-gaming-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/tutorials/getting_started.html

Updated the getting_started page with CMake options information, let me know if it's clear for you


[21-Oct-19 04:03 AM] ca333#0333
we can do a game-jam once the tutorial is set up properly - i.e. adding the flappy tux ref.


[21-Oct-19 04:04 AM] ca333#0333
so if we get this done this week we can start a competition next week - will assign a bounty/reward to it


[21-Oct-19 04:06 AM] Slyris#2880
Ok ok let's speak at the end of the week to see if we finish everything

Great! Just reached home after a short vacation. Will look into it and left the feedback asap

Getting started page is nice üî•  I don't understand C++ code in some places of tic-tac-toe guide (just because I never wrote any code on C++) but in general it looks very clear as well and I believe that devs familiar with C++ will be able to wrap head easily


[22-Oct-19 02:21 AM] Slyris#2880

Means that you call this folder as you wish

-- Could NOT find Doxygen (missing: DOXYGEN_EXECUTABLE) 
Anyway you can ignore it for now


[22-Oct-19 03:27 AM] Slyris#2880
@smkhound For example for this project you will create a folder named tic-tac-toe


[22-Oct-19 03:27 AM] Slyris#2880
and start following the tutorial


[22-Oct-19 03:27 AM] smkhound#7640
as antara-gaming-sdk subfolder, like `~/antara-gaming-sdk/smk-games/`?


[22-Oct-19 03:28 AM] Slyris#2880
Nop


[22-Oct-19 03:28 AM] Slyris#2880
In a folder of your choice


[22-Oct-19 03:28 AM] Slyris#2880
anyway on your computer


[22-Oct-19 03:28 AM] smkhound#7640
cool üôÇ


[22-Oct-19 03:28 AM] Slyris#2880
You don't need to be in the antara gaming folder !


[22-Oct-19 03:28 AM] Slyris#2880
you don't event need to clone it


[22-Oct-19 03:28 AM] Slyris#2880
if it's unclear let me know


[22-Oct-19 03:35 AM] smkhound#7640
the doxygen error was only if running in atara-gaming-sdk folder, dont see it if running in my own folder üëç

are you sure to have the good clang version?


[22-Oct-19 03:37 AM] Slyris#2880
ah i know why


[22-Oct-19 03:37 AM] Slyris#2880

[22-Oct-19 03:38 AM] Slyris#2880
@TonyL Can you send to him the commands ?


[22-Oct-19 03:38 AM] smkhound#7640
I recall similar error on makerbot, Mylo had a docker script which fixed


[22-Oct-19 03:39 AM] Slyris#2880

@smkhound


[22-Oct-19 03:41 AM] Slyris#2880
for linux you need those dependencies


[22-Oct-19 03:41 AM] smkhound#7640
`sudo apt install g++-8` seemed to fix


[22-Oct-19 03:42 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah Because on Linux


[22-Oct-19 03:42 AM] Slyris#2880

[22-Oct-19 03:43 AM] Slyris#2880
I will add an option in the CMake to use the clang one by default

@smkhound


[22-Oct-19 04:12 AM] smkhound#7640
for tictactoe or sdk repo?


[22-Oct-19 04:12 AM] Slyris#2880
for tic tac toe


[22-Oct-19 04:13 AM] Slyris#2880
it's will fetch the last version automatically


[22-Oct-19 04:15 AM] Slyris#2880
@smkhound Testes on my Ubuntu,  it's working now.


[22-Oct-19 04:15 AM] smkhound#7640
cool. so I basically dont need the repo anymore


[22-Oct-19 04:15 AM] Slyris#2880
Nop


[22-Oct-19 04:15 AM] Slyris#2880
For the tutorial


[22-Oct-19 04:15 AM] Slyris#2880
you don't need


[22-Oct-19 04:15 AM] Slyris#2880
But you need to do the same command as in the getting started


[22-Oct-19 04:15 AM] Slyris#2880
It's basically the Same command line


[22-Oct-19 04:16 AM] Slyris#2880
Because the gaming sdk is like a subproject of the tic tac toe when you run CMake


[22-Oct-19 04:16 AM] Slyris#2880
So have the same options etc


[22-Oct-19 04:16 AM] smkhound#7640
```-- Performing Test RANGE_V3_ALIGNED_NEW_PROBE

[22-Oct-19 04:16 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah np


[22-Oct-19 04:16 AM] Slyris#2880
It's checking for dependencies


[22-Oct-19 04:16 AM] Slyris#2880
Don't worry.


[22-Oct-19 04:18 AM] Slyris#2880
@smkhound Let me know if the tutorial is clear etc


[22-Oct-19 04:20 AM] Slyris#2880
I have to admit that's is much more easy to setup on Windows and OSX, because Linux have bunch of specific dependencies


[22-Oct-19 04:20 AM] Slyris#2880
Due to the current compiler choice


[22-Oct-19 04:20 AM] smkhound#7640
only recommendation so far would be to mention making folder for game and putting CMakeLists.txt and game.ccp in there, that was the only slightly confusing bit.


[22-Oct-19 04:20 AM] Slyris#2880
I will probably give some bash scripts in the repository


[22-Oct-19 04:20 AM] Slyris#2880
Ok


[22-Oct-19 04:20 AM] Slyris#2880
Note everything somewhere


[22-Oct-19 04:20 AM] Slyris#2880
and at the end


[22-Oct-19 04:20 AM] Slyris#2880
Open an issue on github

I kinda cheated and read instead of adding each line as mentioned, but it made sense mostly to a guy like me with limited C experince


[22-Oct-19 04:39 AM] smkhound#7640
the draw stuff was well explained


[22-Oct-19 04:46 AM] Slyris#2880
@smkhound you finish the whole tutorial ?


[22-Oct-19 04:47 AM] smkhound#7640
yep, played a few games too to check the logic, worked perfectly


[22-Oct-19 04:47 AM] Slyris#2880
cool


[22-Oct-19 04:47 AM] smkhound#7640
very cool


[22-Oct-19 04:47 AM] Slyris#2880
so dont forget the issue for improvements


[22-Oct-19 04:47 AM] Slyris#2880
did you try the resize stuff ?


[22-Oct-19 04:48 AM] Slyris#2880
to resize the window etc


[22-Oct-19 04:48 AM] smkhound#7640
yep, will read more closely again and submit a PR to docs later tonight


[22-Oct-19 04:49 AM] Slyris#2880
oki great


[22-Oct-19 04:49 AM] Slyris#2880
just for information


[22-Oct-19 04:49 AM] Slyris#2880
the docs is present in the repository


[22-Oct-19 04:49 AM] Slyris#2880
if you want to fix it yourself


[22-Oct-19 04:49 AM] smkhound#7640
seems the best way üëç

^this one is a really good one


[22-Oct-19 04:51 AM] smkhound#7640
havent used rst but at a glance should be easy enough. so far only a few extra bits of info and maybe some wording


[22-Oct-19 04:51 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah probably the folder as you mentionned


[22-Oct-19 04:52 AM] Slyris#2880
But i think you already know the initial goal


[22-Oct-19 04:52 AM] Slyris#2880
to give to the user a command line tools


[22-Oct-19 04:52 AM] Slyris#2880
to create project build it etc


[22-Oct-19 04:52 AM] Slyris#2880
so it's simpler to use


[22-Oct-19 04:52 AM] Slyris#2880
but all of this take some times, so we focus on most important stuff now


[22-Oct-19 04:52 AM] smkhound#7640
I saw in build process there was a sound module too? maybe for a happy winner time sound üòÑ


[22-Oct-19 04:52 AM] Slyris#2880
Once we will have more people inside the project maybe some of them will propose command line tooling


[22-Oct-19 04:52 AM] Slyris#2880
etc


[22-Oct-19 04:52 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah but it's sucks right now


[22-Oct-19 04:53 AM] Slyris#2880
We plan to redo it


[22-Oct-19 04:53 AM] Slyris#2880
but yeah you can play sound, but as you can see this tutorial


[22-Oct-19 04:53 AM] Slyris#2880

resources, keyboard, coliisons


[22-Oct-19 04:53 AM] Slyris#2880
Yep, tic tac toe is really the easiest approach

cool thats what I was looking for


[22-Oct-19 04:57 AM] Slyris#2880
also @smkhound Did you check the lua version of the tictactoe ?


[22-Oct-19 04:58 AM] smkhound#7640
can you put raw rgba? like  `graphics::{76,23,55,99} : graphics::{56,21,77,23};` ?


[22-Oct-19 04:58 AM] smkhound#7640
havent checked lua yet

Lua is probably easier to understand


[22-Oct-19 04:59 AM] Slyris#2880
For rookie


[22-Oct-19 04:59 AM] Slyris#2880
but do exactly the same programm as the C++ one.


[22-Oct-19 04:59 AM] smkhound#7640
looking forward to being able to use this in a deep way by either learning more lua or when python integrated.


[22-Oct-19 04:59 AM] Slyris#2880
You can create a color from (r,g,b,a) or from a predefined one.


[22-Oct-19 04:59 AM] Slyris#2880
Python will be integrated for sure, but not right now.


[22-Oct-19 05:00 AM] Slyris#2880
I know you are looking for it with @TonyL


[22-Oct-19 05:00 AM] smkhound#7640
yeah, first things first


[22-Oct-19 05:00 AM] smkhound#7640
good job so far üéñ


[22-Oct-19 05:00 AM] Slyris#2880

[22-Oct-19 05:01 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah, mostly playing games


[22-Oct-19 05:01 AM] smkhound#7640
"research"


[22-Oct-19 05:02 AM] Slyris#2880
Later


[22-Oct-19 05:02 AM] Slyris#2880
i plan a game launcher


[22-Oct-19 05:02 AM] Slyris#2880
for Komodo Games


[22-Oct-19 05:02 AM] Slyris#2880
But we will need a webdev electron for that i guess


[22-Oct-19 05:02 AM] Slyris#2880

So beautiful


[22-Oct-19 05:05 AM] naezith#9757
people do not like to have extra launchers/platforms if you are not Blizzard. people are sick of Epic Games, Origin, Twitch, GoG etc


[22-Oct-19 05:05 AM] naezith#9757
every company having their own, and those have AAA titles


[22-Oct-19 05:05 AM] Slyris#2880
Because you don't think about fee's @naezith


[22-Oct-19 05:05 AM] naezith#9757
ppl love steam, they won't be pleased to install a new launcher for couple indie games


[22-Oct-19 05:05 AM] smkhound#7640
just dont ask for emails etc and signup ü§¢


[22-Oct-19 05:05 AM] Slyris#2880
Steam take a lot from game dev


[22-Oct-19 05:06 AM] Slyris#2880
Own launcher = own money


[22-Oct-19 05:06 AM] naezith#9757
30%


[22-Oct-19 05:06 AM] Slyris#2880
Man


[22-Oct-19 05:06 AM] Slyris#2880
Are you serious xD


[22-Oct-19 05:06 AM] Slyris#2880
30%


[22-Oct-19 05:06 AM] naezith#9757
big, but it's ok for the visibility it gives you


[22-Oct-19 05:06 AM] Slyris#2880
It's so big


[22-Oct-19 05:06 AM] Slyris#2880
You can have your own launcher and be on steam too


[22-Oct-19 05:06 AM] Slyris#2880
It's what wakfu does


[22-Oct-19 05:06 AM] Slyris#2880
But ofc it's better to have your own launcher, if your games is good people will play


[22-Oct-19 05:06 AM] Slyris#2880
Steam give you visibility


[22-Oct-19 05:06 AM] Slyris#2880
but take 30%


[22-Oct-19 05:07 AM] Slyris#2880
can you imagine


[22-Oct-19 05:07 AM] naezith#9757
wakfu is a mmorpg


[22-Oct-19 05:07 AM] naezith#9757
people are used to have mmorpgs separately


[22-Oct-19 05:07 AM] Slyris#2880
+ we will be banned from steam i guess


[22-Oct-19 05:07 AM] Slyris#2880
if we use blockchain


[22-Oct-19 05:07 AM] Slyris#2880
it's against their rules


[22-Oct-19 05:08 AM] Slyris#2880
Own launcher, enter your key, get your account from your key


[22-Oct-19 05:08 AM] Slyris#2880
Your key's, your account, your stuffs


[22-Oct-19 05:08 AM] naezith#9757
I can imagine 30%, I have my game there, just like many other famous publishers


[22-Oct-19 05:09 AM] naezith#9757
imagine


[22-Oct-19 05:09 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah , but don't worry


[22-Oct-19 05:09 AM] naezith#9757
devolver digital


[22-Oct-19 05:09 AM] Slyris#2880
For people building games without blockchain integration


[22-Oct-19 05:09 AM] Slyris#2880
They will probably publish on Steam


[22-Oct-19 05:09 AM] Slyris#2880
but for others


[22-Oct-19 05:09 AM] Slyris#2880
we need to give a decentralized Solution


[22-Oct-19 05:09 AM] Slyris#2880
Seem's more logic for me


[22-Oct-19 05:09 AM] naezith#9757
this kind of publishers have billion games under their name


[22-Oct-19 05:09 AM] naezith#9757
and they still publish on steam


[22-Oct-19 05:10 AM] naezith#9757
because that's what players like


[22-Oct-19 05:10 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah but steam don't let publisher using blockchain in games


[22-Oct-19 05:10 AM] naezith#9757
that's another topic, you can discuss it with steam


[22-Oct-19 05:10 AM] Slyris#2880
So for people using blockchain integration what do you suggest ^^'


[22-Oct-19 05:10 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah i got your point


[22-Oct-19 05:10 AM] Slyris#2880
I even agree


[22-Oct-19 05:10 AM] naezith#9757
main reason for that ban is some free games were using people's computers to mine bitcoin üòÑ


[22-Oct-19 05:10 AM] Slyris#2880
But the idea of an different economy in game using blockchain == steam will get zero money


[22-Oct-19 05:10 AM] Slyris#2880
Steam will never publish a blockchain game


[22-Oct-19 05:11 AM] Slyris#2880
because fee's are not for them


[22-Oct-19 05:11 AM] Slyris#2880
but for the game creator


[22-Oct-19 05:11 AM] Slyris#2880
We can discuss the whole life with steam


[22-Oct-19 05:11 AM] Slyris#2880
If at the end you tell them


[22-Oct-19 05:12 AM] Slyris#2880
"you will have no money, we prefer give money to the creator of games"


[22-Oct-19 05:12 AM] Slyris#2880
They will tell you ok good bye


[22-Oct-19 05:12 AM] Slyris#2880
But ofc, if you decide to do a game like RON without blockchain integration but build with the SDK feel free to publish on steam without any problem


[22-Oct-19 05:12 AM] Slyris#2880
and we both agree on that


[22-Oct-19 05:13 AM] Slyris#2880
But if you plan to write a blockchain game with a blockchain economy inside this game, Steam will never let you publish this game


[22-Oct-19 05:14 AM] Slyris#2880
Don't forget that Steam is so simple to reproduce: It's just a game fetcher/launcher with some success integration in certain games


[22-Oct-19 05:14 AM] Slyris#2880
It's straightforward to do an equivalent for blockchain


[22-Oct-19 05:14 AM] naezith#9757
you pull people to the Steam platform


[22-Oct-19 05:14 AM] naezith#9757
it's always profitable for them


[22-Oct-19 05:15 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah, but is i tell you, most of people will use the SDK for blockchains stuff integration in their games


[22-Oct-19 05:15 AM] Slyris#2880
Which is incompatible with STEAM rules


[22-Oct-19 05:15 AM] Slyris#2880
Blizzard is not on steam for Fee's reason


[22-Oct-19 05:15 AM] Slyris#2880
But we will not be on STEAM for rules reason


[22-Oct-19 05:15 AM] Slyris#2880
and mostly because if you believe in blockchain steam is the strict opposite

Steam is not the friend of the indie developers, you need to know.


[22-Oct-19 05:16 AM] Slyris#2880
They give you visibility


[22-Oct-19 05:16 AM] Slyris#2880
for a non sense cost (30%)


[22-Oct-19 05:17 AM] Slyris#2880
When you are an indie developer and worked on a games 4 years like you


[22-Oct-19 05:17 AM] naezith#9757
yeah publish on itch.io


[22-Oct-19 05:17 AM] naezith#9757
and noone will see the game


[22-Oct-19 05:17 AM] Slyris#2880
you should be ashamed of this


[22-Oct-19 05:17 AM] Slyris#2880
Actually when RON will be perfectly support on console


[22-Oct-19 05:17 AM] naezith#9757
100% of nothing is nothing


[22-Oct-19 05:17 AM] Slyris#2880
You can sell it in shop


[22-Oct-19 05:17 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah i get you


[22-Oct-19 05:17 AM] Slyris#2880
But blockchain growth


[22-Oct-19 05:18 AM] Slyris#2880
You need to believe that if we become the first portal of decentralized games


[22-Oct-19 05:18 AM] Slyris#2880
people will look after that


[22-Oct-19 05:18 AM] Slyris#2880
And if your game is good


[22-Oct-19 05:18 AM] Slyris#2880
people will speak about it


[22-Oct-19 05:19 AM] Slyris#2880
Steam is great because of their API and possibility and visibility


[22-Oct-19 05:19 AM] Slyris#2880
But when you take 30% to someone that did his game alone during 4 years


[22-Oct-19 05:19 AM] Slyris#2880
it's a bit a shame


[22-Oct-19 05:20 AM] Slyris#2880
+ Don't forget that we will support Mobile and Web latter


[22-Oct-19 05:20 AM] Slyris#2880
We will already have to deal with Google Play same problem


[22-Oct-19 05:20 AM] Slyris#2880
and probably IOS store


[22-Oct-19 05:20 AM] naezith#9757
no other option


[22-Oct-19 05:20 AM] naezith#9757
for ron


[22-Oct-19 05:20 AM] Slyris#2880
Make a website


[22-Oct-19 05:20 AM] Slyris#2880
pay for google ads


[22-Oct-19 05:21 AM] Slyris#2880
cost less than all steam take from you


[22-Oct-19 05:21 AM] Slyris#2880
but in your case


[22-Oct-19 05:21 AM] Slyris#2880
steam is good


[22-Oct-19 05:21 AM] Slyris#2880
you right.


[22-Oct-19 05:21 AM] Slyris#2880
But the problem is not your game, the problem is what we have as solution for blockchain games ?


[22-Oct-19 05:22 AM] Slyris#2880
Google Play, IOS Store and Steam will simply say no to US.


[22-Oct-19 05:22 AM] Slyris#2880
So we obviously need alternative


[22-Oct-19 05:53 AM] smkhound#7640
could you do a demo version level in steam without blockchain, linking to the full chain edition?


[22-Oct-19 05:54 AM] Slyris#2880
in theory yes but some feature will be disabled in the demo version


[22-Oct-19 05:54 AM] Slyris#2880
feature that can interest the player

will send you shortly


[23-Oct-19 02:38 AM] ca333#0333
ref. the above questions and just for sake of transparency (reposting what i sent you in DM)

we will likely target 2 areas:

i) independent game developers and inidie-game studios 
ii) professional game devs and studios

We are a pure tech-provider and we will make sure that our license will give us X% of ALL game revenues (game sales, ads, ingame-stores, etc.) that were built on top of our gaming SDK - we will NOT distribute/release/sell games. This removes a lot of head-ache and still ensures we profit from games that generate revenue. For games that are 100% free and without any revenue (no ads, etc.) the license will allow them to fully utilize the SDK and build whatever games they want with it. This keeps everything fair and in the sense of our core vision.

like this


[23-Oct-19 02:57 AM] ca333#0333
yea - separate this image into few objects (head, arms, torso, legs) and use these with a movement to have it look animated


[23-Oct-19 02:57 AM] naezith#9757
that's too much for a tutorial imo


[23-Oct-19 02:58 AM] ca333#0333
true


[23-Oct-19 02:58 AM] ca333#0333
i leave it up to you then


[23-Oct-19 02:58 AM] Slyris#2880
We didn't code the animation spritesheet stuff yet


[23-Oct-19 02:58 AM] Slyris#2880
so it's will be simpler with one image for the moment

we need something cc0

or a nice license


[23-Oct-19 03:00 AM] Slyris#2880
we have cc


[23-Oct-19 03:00 AM] Slyris#2880
already


[23-Oct-19 03:00 AM] naezith#9757
for assets I mean


[23-Oct-19 03:00 AM] naezith#9757
so we can share it


[23-Oct-19 03:00 AM] Slyris#2880
but a very restrictive one


[23-Oct-19 03:00 AM] Slyris#2880
what is cc ?


[23-Oct-19 03:00 AM] Slyris#2880
creative commons ?


[23-Oct-19 03:01 AM] naezith#9757
we need something free to use and share as long as you credit


[23-Oct-19 03:02 AM] Slyris#2880

a flappy komodo would be cool too - maybe we can alternatively add a flying komodo dragon or so - swapping the game-char should be just replacing the asset


[23-Oct-19 03:04 AM] Slyris#2880
that is possible ^


[23-Oct-19 03:07 AM] Slyris#2880

What if you guys use bitcoin price graph instead üòâ Have to stay between those lines

"test your trading skill"

"flappy bitcoin"


[24-Oct-19 12:12 PM] naezith#9757
suits well


[24-Oct-19 12:12 PM] Audo#5667
... and to add an extra layer of skill you have to be press 'Z' to go long while you are above the price graph and 'X' to short while below the price graph. Total score is the amount of Bitcoin you own at the end. If you go over those TA lines you crash and burn. Game over.

[24-Oct-19 12:13 PM] naezith#9757
sad flappy game


[24-Oct-19 12:38 PM] Audo#5667
... and then combine that flappy game with the 'bitcoin to the moon' game to get a gambling element in. The game starts and you start making money, you can stop at any point and take the win, however, the game can end at random time (by the 'house') and in that case you lose everything. We could say there's a little chance that you lose internet connection and you crash.

That would make it so annoying game that I bet it would turn into a hate/love relationship and a great success

also, mingw vs msvc for windows build? @ca333

I lean towards mingw but roman says vs2019 is superior today


[28-Oct-19 03:38 AM] naezith#9757
in terms of performance


[28-Oct-19 03:38 AM] jl777c#5810
msvc would be more reliable builds as windows tends to make some custom "optimizations" that are only there via msvc


[28-Oct-19 03:38 AM] naezith#9757
ok msvc it is then


[28-Oct-19 03:44 AM] ca333#0333
agree - for windows use MSVC (unless they break their own compatibility and turn it less reliable)


[28-Oct-19 03:46 AM] ca333#0333
and yea - that seems a discord bug - marked "dont clear" but it cleared anyway... @naezith

macOS and iOS is the only platform where HiDPI support of an app can't be advertised programmatically. In case of CMake, you have to supply a custom *.plist file with NSHighResolutionCapable enabled.

Hello @ca333 @jl777c 

I read the article: https://medium.com/@jameslee777/multichain-decentralized-cashier-for-gaming-110297ced95f

It's will be possible to build a high level system based on this article in the antara gaming sdk when we will start the second layer i think !

Everything is already ready in the gaming SDK i think.

awesome @naezith - well done!


[02-Nov-19 06:13 AM] Slyris#2880
@ca333 We will finish the rst tutorials now, and once is done we will be ready i think


[02-Nov-19 06:13 AM] ca333#0333
yes - we can certainly add a "gambling" lib to the gaming SDK for things like Poker, Roulette, etc.


[02-Nov-19 06:13 AM] Slyris#2880
Right now, we can write systems that communicate with RPC from Komodo

after the blockchain layer is implemented we can certainly work on a BlackJack showcase app - thats a good idea


[02-Nov-19 06:16 AM] Slyris#2880
Yep, we finishing first the tutorials for flappy birds, and after that let's organize a small game jam to discover bug or problems in the SDK

Once we have feedback from the game jam


[02-Nov-19 06:16 AM] Slyris#2880
We can optimize stuff and move forward


[02-Nov-19 06:18 AM] Slyris#2880
Once the tutorials is finish to write, i will ping you @ca333  and @TonyL for a review of the tutorials, if you want after that we can do a short overview on the code base, and then move to the game jam stuff


[02-Nov-19 06:20 AM] ca333#0333
sounds good @Slyris - once this is done and considered ready for a gamejam we will create a public gamejam channel and announce it.


[02-Nov-19 06:20 AM] Slyris#2880
As I was more on the backend of the SDK rather than the tutorials, I would like to have the overall opinion of @naezith  on the usability of the SDK, as a game developer you like it? What does it change for you in relation to developing your game from scratch?


[02-Nov-19 06:21 AM] Slyris#2880
I have always been eager to make a very strong code base, and easy to use for a user, I really hope that is the case.


[02-Nov-19 06:21 AM] Slyris#2880
You should know that absolutely all modules (except graphics) are tested individually with a coverage of 98%. I'm trying to make the code self-explanatory.


[02-Nov-19 06:22 AM] naezith#9757
smooth. I requested the stuff I didn't feel comfy with so


[02-Nov-19 06:22 AM] naezith#9757
it's good now, maybe some other stuff might pop up as we do different examples


[02-Nov-19 06:23 AM] Slyris#2880
Yes as I already explained I would have proposed standalone modules that can serve you in video games like QuadTree System, OctoTree System, Djikstra System (PathFinding). Chargers maps, little things that makes life easier for the developer.

Hello tomorrow, I will work on the possibility of adding an optional ninth step on the possibility of storing the scores of a party of our flappy bird on the blockchain, I would like to know what tools I need to be able to achieve that ? Ideally I would just like to be able to call the RPC command line with a specific storage command and give the score list in a json format if it's possible, thank you for telling me if it's possible now
!

if someone can drive me into this @ca333 ?

Once i have the rpc tools available, it's will take less than one hours to connect blockchain to our flappy game.


[02-Nov-19 10:47 AM] Slyris#2880
Ideally I would like to add it in the following thing:
https://docs.komodoplatform.com/nSPV/#enabling-the-nspv-client

if it's possible to do it from nSPV for not downloading the whole blockchain

[02-Nov-19 10:48 AM] Slyris#2880
Ideally the system itself will just use a `curl` command on a local nSPV client with the good values


[02-Nov-19 10:51 AM] Slyris#2880
So ideally we start an nSPV client with a local coin/assets for the flappy game

And store the score using a curl to the nSPV client with the score list.


[02-Nov-19 10:54 AM] Slyris#2880
Ideally we can use the antara-composer to create a chain for this in a few minutes, and just from the SDK and the specific score system specify a config with this specific coin.

And automatically i launch an nSPV client connected to this asset chain and start storing on it.


[02-Nov-19 12:26 PM] ca333#0333
@Slyris i need to check if we already have a high level OP_return interface on libNSPV to store data in a very simple way on the Komodo Blockchain (if not it can be added easily) - afterwards we just set up a website with a slightly modified insight blockexplorer to show highscore entries based on the TX_ID - for now it won't be trustless or sort of provable fair-game-play blockchain logic but instead just some sort of KV storage (TX-ID being the key and highscore the val) - basically (ab)using the blockchain as the DB. But it will help you with the first steps on this layer. libNSPV can also be used to just receive coins to an ingame wallet and send them, etc. And afterwards we bundle the most essential CCs into a lib and design/specify the ones that we need from a high level perspective - instead of explicit game CCs like rogue and tetris we need something more dynamic and globally usable.  e.g. highscoreCC which could have an internal validation algorithm that other games would have to integrate - basically something with an RNG layer and using other vars such as timestamps, current blockhashs of nSaveHeight etc. that together combined/hashed get stored on the blockchain during the gameplay (through a OP_return TX) and form this highscoreCC - this or a very similar extended logic can be used for a fairgameplayCC which would implement a more flexible interface. 
But yea - lets start with the libNSPV first.


[02-Nov-19 12:28 PM] Slyris#2880
libNSPV is able to communicate through the Komodo Blockchain with the CCs alright ?


[02-Nov-19 12:29 PM] ca333#0333
no - but libNSPV can communicate with the Komodo Blockchain to gather specific transaction/output infos and also to create transactions and receive/spend coins.


[02-Nov-19 12:29 PM] ca333#0333
CCs are not mobile/lite ready yet.


[02-Nov-19 12:29 PM] Slyris#2880
Hmm ok, but we will be able to store score without downloading the whole blockchain ?


[02-Nov-19 12:29 PM] Slyris#2880
I hope


[02-Nov-19 12:30 PM] Slyris#2880
According to your first solutions yes


[02-Nov-19 12:30 PM] ca333#0333
yes that will be possible with libNSPV - worst case we just have to extend it (its an already supported functionality)


[02-Nov-19 12:30 PM] Slyris#2880
But this is not in the final stage what we will want


[02-Nov-19 12:30 PM] Slyris#2880
Yep


[02-Nov-19 12:30 PM] Slyris#2880
Ok I got it let's talk about it in details tomorrow


[02-Nov-19 12:30 PM] Slyris#2880
I'm out tonight!


[02-Nov-19 12:30 PM] ca333#0333
exactly - the final goal is using real blockchain logic for/in the game. This will be possible with CCs - but for this we need to run the komodo-daemon (syncing full blockchain).


[02-Nov-19 12:31 PM] Slyris#2880
Syncing full Blockchain mean how much time to run your game ?


[02-Nov-19 12:31 PM] Slyris#2880
Can you sync from the most recent notarization ?


[02-Nov-19 12:31 PM] ca333#0333
But CCs will eventually be supported on mobile too - just a matter of time. So if our SDK supports the legacy CCs it will also easily support the mobile layer as soon that is ready - interface would stay the same only endpoints would change.


[02-Nov-19 12:32 PM] Slyris#2880
Ok lot of work on this point


[02-Nov-19 12:32 PM] Slyris#2880
That's why we will need to meet about it.


[02-Nov-19 12:32 PM] ca333#0333
`Can you sync from the most recent notarization ?` - no that is not supported (yet).


[02-Nov-19 12:33 PM] Slyris#2880
It's will be a huge step


[02-Nov-19 12:33 PM] Slyris#2880
The idea at the final stage will be to launch your game without waiting hours the first time ideally


[02-Nov-19 12:34 PM] Slyris#2880
Even it's the same stage as downloading a game finally


[02-Nov-19 12:34 PM] Slyris#2880
But here means downloading the game and then download the blockchain


[02-Nov-19 12:34 PM] ca333#0333
yes that is the final target and it will be possible one day


[02-Nov-19 12:35 PM] Slyris#2880
At this moment we will change the history


[02-Nov-19 12:35 PM] Slyris#2880
Of blockchain


[02-Nov-19 12:35 PM] Slyris#2880
At this moment we will change the history


[02-Nov-19 12:35 PM] ca333#0333
maybe libNSPV can be extended by CC functionality faster then modifying the native SPV interface to support them.


[02-Nov-19 12:35 PM] jl777c#5810
libnspv already supports some CC rpc calls


[02-Nov-19 12:35 PM] ca333#0333
But one step at a time - lets reach the first goals and in then we can focus on the rest.


[02-Nov-19 12:35 PM] jl777c#5810
not all are supported yet and some will likely not be possible, but the simpler ones are supported already


[02-Nov-19 12:36 PM] ca333#0333
excellent - so eventually that layer can be used!


[02-Nov-19 12:37 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, can start with using native mode daemon but then change to libnspv when it is fully ready, just make all the rpc calls go through an abstraction layer, so it can use whichever config is on the system


[02-Nov-19 12:38 PM] Slyris#2880
It's exactly what I want


[02-Nov-19 12:38 PM] Slyris#2880
Give a configuration and let's go


[02-Nov-19 12:38 PM] ca333#0333
yes exactly - that was the plan as proposed. And knowing about libNSPV being the holy grail soon takes away all headaches


[02-Nov-19 12:38 PM] ca333#0333
so for now we can just proceed as if it was already mobile/lite ready


[02-Nov-19 12:38 PM] jl777c#5810
keep in mind the latency is much higher when using libnspv


[02-Nov-19 12:39 PM] ca333#0333
do we have an approx. benchmark on it? i.e. would it be in an acceptable range?


[02-Nov-19 12:40 PM] Slyris#2880
Why we have a latency penalty ?


[02-Nov-19 12:40 PM] Slyris#2880
Just to know


[02-Nov-19 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
nspv client needs to contact fullnodes to achieve the nspv transaction


[02-Nov-19 12:40 PM] Slyris#2880
I can perform operation asynchronous from my side


[02-Nov-19 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
from getting headers, to txproofs, to notarization data


[02-Nov-19 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
and for CC, to construct the unsigned transaction


[02-Nov-19 12:41 PM] jl777c#5810
and you will likely need to contact more than one node to crosscheck


[02-Nov-19 12:42 PM] jl777c#5810
instead of being able to use the data locally from a full native mode daemon that has all the blockchain data right there, EVERYTHING needs to be validated, step by step as we cant trust any fullnode and the notarizations need to be fetched, average 30kb per transaction for the proofs


[02-Nov-19 12:42 PM] jl777c#5810
it is like using SPV server for all requests, with each tx needing multiple steps


[02-Nov-19 12:43 PM] Slyris#2880
Erf


[02-Nov-19 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
not very realtime game friendly


[02-Nov-19 12:43 PM] ca333#0333
if it is in an acceptable range it think we can plan around it for "normal" games - for gambling/live-(multi)player-games it could be a problem unless we implemented a "delay" fur such games into the blockchain-interface - so it won't ever be "realtime"


[02-Nov-19 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
3 seconds would be a fast completion, might take 30 seconds, which is ok for occasional sending of funds


[02-Nov-19 12:43 PM] Slyris#2880
So for real-time we are forced to download the whole blockchain


[02-Nov-19 12:43 PM] Slyris#2880
If I understand


[02-Nov-19 12:44 PM] Slyris#2880
And it's should work on mobile ?


[02-Nov-19 12:44 PM] ca333#0333
ingame stores, ingame wallets, etc. is enough for the beginning so it wont be a problem for us


[02-Nov-19 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
even that might not be enough, if you need confirmed transactions


[02-Nov-19 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
so any usage of nSPV needs to be carefully designed to make sure its performance will be sufficient for its usecase

Any windows instructions for libNSPV @jl777c  ?


[02-Nov-19 12:49 PM] Slyris#2880
For building


[02-Nov-19 12:49 PM] jl777c#5810
i heard it builds, but not sure the details


[02-Nov-19 12:49 PM] Slyris#2880
Will support only osx for the moment so


[02-Nov-19 12:49 PM] jl777c#5810
here is high level of what nSPV has to do: https://medium.com/@jameslee777/nspv-a-simple-approach-to-superlight-clients-leveraging-notarizations-75d7ef5a37a9

@TonyL Hello !

If it's possible to drive me today to setup libnspv correctly with Rick or Morty, i already did the step one building on osx using Homebrew.

But for the rest the doc is a bit unclear to me !

Thanks !

Hello! @Slyris Sure, I'll need to prepare some reliable RICK/MORTY full nodes with nSPV support. Tbh I'm not sure who made/supports brew package - maybe it's better to make from source.
`Any windows instructions for libNSPV` I've made a crosscompiling Windows build script (for Ubuntu) https://github.com/jl777/libnspv/blob/master/build_win.sh few months ago - most probably it still works

Yes

The doc is a bit unclear for me


[03-Nov-19 12:15 AM] TonyL#3577
coins file should be in the same directory with libnspv bin


[03-Nov-19 12:15 AM] Slyris#2880
Ok good to know


[03-Nov-19 12:15 AM] Slyris#2880
And do you have an example of config for rick and morty that i can justuse ?


[03-Nov-19 12:16 AM] Slyris#2880
for rick or morty


[03-Nov-19 12:16 AM] TonyL#3577
I'll need to prepare some reliable RICK/MORTY full nodes with nSPV support to provide such


[03-Nov-19 12:16 AM] Slyris#2880
ok i will need it in the SDK


[03-Nov-19 12:16 AM] Slyris#2880
for testing purpose

}
```  there are some nodes needs to be specified in `nSPV` field (fullnodes with nSPV support)


[03-Nov-19 12:18 AM] TonyL#3577
will prepare such config for you asap


[03-Nov-19 12:20 AM] Slyris#2880
Ok thanks a lot @TonyL


[03-Nov-19 12:20 AM] Slyris#2880
Once I have that and launch the libNSPV binary with this config , I'm all set ?


[03-Nov-19 12:21 AM] TonyL#3577
yes, you'll need to launch it like a `./libnspv RICK` or `./libnspv MORTY` as soon as you'll have proper `coins` config


[03-Nov-19 12:23 AM] TonyL#3577
https://github.com/jl777/libnspv/blob/master/coins#L99 I can see there are already some nodes for RICK, maybe they are alive

[03-Nov-19 12:26 AM] Slyris#2880
Ideally at the last stage we will want a prebuild libNSPV for each platform @TonyL


[03-Nov-19 12:26 AM] Slyris#2880
So I can just download it from CMake


[03-Nov-19 12:26 AM] Slyris#2880
And use it immediately


[03-Nov-19 12:26 AM] TonyL#3577
prebuilt binary?


[03-Nov-19 12:26 AM] Slyris#2880
Of lobnspv


[03-Nov-19 12:26 AM] Slyris#2880
Libnspv


[03-Nov-19 12:26 AM] Slyris#2880
Such as mm2 prebuild


[03-Nov-19 12:27 AM] TonyL#3577
@Sir Seven somewhere in the middle of libnspv CI/CD setup, hope he'll finish it soon and update us here


[03-Nov-19 12:27 AM] Slyris#2880
For the moment I will support only osx


[03-Nov-19 12:27 AM] Slyris#2880
In the home manual way


[03-Nov-19 12:27 AM] Slyris#2880
But ideally


[03-Nov-19 12:27 AM] Slyris#2880
I want to download binary for specific distribution and go on


[03-Nov-19 12:28 AM] TonyL#3577
He is using github actions and will support ubuntu, windows and osx


[03-Nov-19 12:28 AM] Slyris#2880
Appimage on Linux it's I think the best solution


[03-Nov-19 12:28 AM] TonyL#3577
Ok, packaging/bundling it'll be the next step


[03-Nov-19 12:29 AM] Slyris#2880
Allowing us to have a single binary is cool


[03-Nov-19 12:29 AM] TonyL#3577
But in general when you make output is single binary as well


[03-Nov-19 12:29 AM] TonyL#3577
and it's comfortable to edit `coins` outside of bundle


[03-Nov-19 12:30 AM] Slyris#2880
It's always possible


[03-Nov-19 12:30 AM] Slyris#2880
To specify directory path through command line


[03-Nov-19 12:30 AM] TonyL#3577
What the point to put single binary file into appimage?


[03-Nov-19 12:30 AM] Slyris#2880
And I think it's the best solution


[03-Nov-19 12:30 AM] Slyris#2880
Appimage is a single binary bundle


[03-Nov-19 12:30 AM] Slyris#2880
Containing directories


[03-Nov-19 12:30 AM] Slyris#2880
It's what I mean


[03-Nov-19 12:31 AM] Slyris#2880
By "single bundle"


[03-Nov-19 12:31 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm, it have html wallet also so maybe it worth to bundle


[03-Nov-19 12:31 AM] Slyris#2880

now i will try to launch nspv correctly


[03-Nov-19 12:32 AM] Slyris#2880
once i have config RICK or MORTY i will try it with you


[03-Nov-19 12:33 AM] Slyris#2880
and once is done and i can do some curl, i will move on the C++ part.


[03-Nov-19 12:34 AM] Slyris#2880
I see your build @TonyL for Windows


[03-Nov-19 12:34 AM] Slyris#2880
I saw you compile it statically


[03-Nov-19 12:34 AM] Slyris#2880
this mean there is no extras DLL's alright ?


[03-Nov-19 12:35 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh it was in july, do not remember tbh. I can retest on clean windows

I cannot release anything related to nSPV stuffs without a proper cross platform binary distribution

otherwise it's will be painfull for the users

ton install external tools manually

[03-Nov-19 01:50 AM] TonyL#3577
there will be binaries from CI/CD

and that's all


[03-Nov-19 01:54 AM] TonyL#3577
how do you want to put coins file inside?


[03-Nov-19 01:54 AM] Slyris#2880
It's not a good idea to bundle coins file inside


[03-Nov-19 01:54 AM] Slyris#2880
we should specify the path withc ommand line


[03-Nov-19 01:54 AM] Slyris#2880
for the files


[03-Nov-19 01:54 AM] Slyris#2880
or env variable


[03-Nov-19 01:54 AM] TonyL#3577
should we make custom binary which can search for coins file outside of appimage/.app package?


[03-Nov-19 01:54 AM] Slyris#2880
Nop


[03-Nov-19 01:55 AM] Slyris#2880
./my_appimage --option_of_my_binary


[03-Nov-19 01:55 AM] Slyris#2880
so


[03-Nov-19 01:55 AM] Slyris#2880
./nspv --coins-dir=PATH


[03-Nov-19 01:55 AM] Slyris#2880
related to your assets path for your game for example ...


[03-Nov-19 01:55 AM] Slyris#2880
It's look by default into the same directory of the executable


[03-Nov-19 01:56 AM] Slyris#2880
but adding a cmd line option to specify the path


[03-Nov-19 01:56 AM] Slyris#2880
is not so difficult i guess


[03-Nov-19 01:56 AM] TonyL#3577
works on OSX as well (compiled manually)

cool i will try it after thank's


[03-Nov-19 01:56 AM] TonyL#3577
```Nop
./my_appimage --option_of_my_binary
so
./nspv --coins-dir=PATH``` ok, so some modifications to libnspv needed


[03-Nov-19 01:57 AM] Slyris#2880
@jl777c Do we have an option for libnspv to specify the coins dir ?


[03-Nov-19 01:57 AM] Slyris#2880
It's will be great for external program that launch the program with their own assets such as game.


[03-Nov-19 01:58 AM] Slyris#2880

[03-Nov-19 01:58 AM] Slyris#2880
this look like this for antara gaming sdk


[03-Nov-19 01:58 AM] Slyris#2880
I will have an extras directory in assets


[03-Nov-19 01:58 AM] Slyris#2880
called tools


[03-Nov-19 01:59 AM] Slyris#2880
Inside will be the nspv binary


[03-Nov-19 01:59 AM] TonyL#3577
but libnspv contains from `nspv` binary thats it


[03-Nov-19 01:59 AM] TonyL#3577
if you'll not use html wallet


[03-Nov-19 01:59 AM] Slyris#2880
I will use the rpc command line


[03-Nov-19 01:59 AM] Slyris#2880
Launching nspv, and using curl


[03-Nov-19 01:59 AM] Slyris#2880
My C++ will launch nspv from a specific system


[03-Nov-19 01:59 AM] TonyL#3577
Why you can't make `bin` folder in your project and put nspv binary here?


[03-Nov-19 01:59 AM] Slyris#2880
It's need to be in assets


[03-Nov-19 01:00 AM] Slyris#2880
such as mm2 for atomic dex


[03-Nov-19 01:00 AM] Slyris#2880
`assets/tools`


[03-Nov-19 01:00 AM] TonyL#3577
mm2 is executable as well


[03-Nov-19 01:00 AM] Slyris#2880
y


[03-Nov-19 01:00 AM] TonyL#3577
not in appimage or something like this


[03-Nov-19 01:00 AM] TonyL#3577
because whats the point to put single binary into appimage


[03-Nov-19 01:00 AM] Slyris#2880
But you know why i want an appimage ?


[03-Nov-19 01:00 AM] TonyL#3577
Trying to understand üôÇ


[03-Nov-19 01:00 AM] Slyris#2880
Simply because it's run standalone without installing shared library


[03-Nov-19 01:00 AM] Slyris#2880
When you build an appimage


[03-Nov-19 01:01 AM] Slyris#2880
It's automatically detect the dependencies


[03-Nov-19 01:01 AM] Slyris#2880
And rewrite the RPATH


[03-Nov-19 01:01 AM] Slyris#2880
to a local directory inside the appimage


[03-Nov-19 01:01 AM] Slyris#2880
means


[03-Nov-19 01:01 AM] Slyris#2880
User don't have to sudo apt get install


[03-Nov-19 01:01 AM] Slyris#2880
dependencies


[03-Nov-19 01:01 AM] Slyris#2880
It's run standalone


[03-Nov-19 01:01 AM] TonyL#3577
But we can statically link all


[03-Nov-19 01:01 AM] TonyL#3577
As for komodod


[03-Nov-19 01:01 AM] Slyris#2880
Do you know the command `ldd` ?


[03-Nov-19 01:02 AM] Slyris#2880
can you please try to do `ldd nspv` on ubuntu


[03-Nov-19 01:02 AM] Slyris#2880
and send me the screenshot


[03-Nov-19 01:02 AM] Slyris#2880
I'm not sure that libsodium and libevent license allowing you to build it statically to be honest


[03-Nov-19 01:02 AM] TonyL#3577

Yeah as you can see


[03-Nov-19 01:03 AM] Slyris#2880
libsodium libevent


[03-Nov-19 01:03 AM] Slyris#2880
are shared library


[03-Nov-19 01:03 AM] Slyris#2880
i don't know if it's possible to have it statically


[03-Nov-19 01:03 AM] Slyris#2880
Using an appimage


[03-Nov-19 01:03 AM] Slyris#2880
they will be automatically bundled


[03-Nov-19 01:03 AM] Slyris#2880
Into the appimage


[03-Nov-19 01:03 AM] Slyris#2880
and the user don't need to install them

May be it's possible


[03-Nov-19 01:05 AM] Slyris#2880
but ideally


[03-Nov-19 01:06 AM] Slyris#2880
keep everything shared


[03-Nov-19 01:06 AM] Slyris#2880
and give an appimage possibility


[03-Nov-19 01:06 AM] Slyris#2880
the appimage tool that i give to you

[03-Nov-19 01:06 AM] Slyris#2880
with good RPATH


[03-Nov-19 01:07 AM] Slyris#2880
and + the fact is


[03-Nov-19 01:07 AM] Slyris#2880
appimage run on every linux


[03-Nov-19 01:07 AM] Slyris#2880
not only ubuntu


[03-Nov-19 01:07 AM] Slyris#2880
means that komodod fresh binary builded on ubuntu doesn't run on fedora


[03-Nov-19 01:07 AM] Slyris#2880
and others linux


[03-Nov-19 01:07 AM] Slyris#2880
where appimage work immediately


[03-Nov-19 01:08 AM] Slyris#2880
Do you image us telling to our users for launching on of the game builded with the sdk to do extras stuffon fedora


[03-Nov-19 01:08 AM] Slyris#2880
before launching their game


[03-Nov-19 01:08 AM] jl777c#5810
if appimage is an universal solution, it seems to make sense to use it


[03-Nov-19 01:08 AM] Slyris#2880
There is only 3 solution to run on every linux: AppImage, Static building, or use another langage like Python


[03-Nov-19 01:09 AM] jl777c#5810
hopefully someone can make a PR to solve this


[03-Nov-19 01:09 AM] Slyris#2880
Linus Torvalds itself say that appimage is really great !


[03-Nov-19 01:09 AM] Slyris#2880
@jl777c For adding the option to launch nspv with a coindir path ?


[03-Nov-19 01:09 AM] jl777c#5810
if it works with all distributions, that sounds very good


[03-Nov-19 01:09 AM] TonyL#3577
`if appimage is an universal solution, it seems to make sense to use it` yeah, we can also package komodod this way in such case

[03-Nov-19 01:10 AM] Slyris#2880
that's the idea

you had me at "works on all distros"

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[03-Nov-19 01:11 AM] Slyris#2880
Yep it's like the equivalent of `.app` for OSX


[03-Nov-19 01:11 AM] Slyris#2880
A bundle that contains the binary and the rpath are modified during the bundling


[03-Nov-19 01:11 AM] Slyris#2880
to point to a local /usr/lib inside the appimage


[03-Nov-19 01:11 AM] Slyris#2880
containing all the shared library


[03-Nov-19 01:12 AM] Slyris#2880
but not this one for example: `/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f8a97408000)` This one is universal


[03-Nov-19 01:12 AM] Slyris#2880
and defined by every distros at the same path

https://docs.appimage.org/introduction/concepts.html


[03-Nov-19 01:13 AM] Slyris#2880
The best idea is to build on an old distros to run on a newer


[03-Nov-19 01:13 AM] Slyris#2880
So 14.04 or 16.04 may be a good idea


[03-Nov-19 01:13 AM] Slyris#2880
for building an appimage


[03-Nov-19 01:13 AM] TonyL#3577
yeah, otherwise libc will be a problem


[03-Nov-19 01:13 AM] Slyris#2880
Newer we will face the libc issue @TonyL


[03-Nov-19 01:13 AM] Slyris#2880
If you remember


[03-Nov-19 01:13 AM] Slyris#2880
yeah


[03-Nov-19 01:14 AM] Slyris#2880
Here: https://docs.appimage.org/reference/appdir.html

You have the directory specification


[03-Nov-19 01:15 AM] Slyris#2880
Personnaly in the SDK i automatically generate an appimage if the user turn on the option


[03-Nov-19 01:15 AM] Slyris#2880
It's really easy

in general it's not hard to make so I believe will be easy for Sir Seven to add it to CI/CD process


[03-Nov-19 01:17 AM] Slyris#2880
```cpp
namespace antara::gaming::core::details

    std::filesystem::path binary_real_path() noexcept
    {
        return std::filesystem::read_symlink("/proc/" + std::to_string(getpid()) + "/exe");

    std::filesystem::path assets_real_path() noexcept
    {
        return binary_real_path().parent_path().parent_path() / "share/assets/";
    }
}
```

I use this to access my assets directory directly from my code


[03-Nov-19 01:18 AM] Slyris#2880
So whenever i'm building appimage or not


[03-Nov-19 01:18 AM] Slyris#2880
i have the good assets path

If you need help on building an appimage just ping me

Meanwhile this time if we can add the option for directory path to nspv it's really cool

In 1hours half i will be afk until 6pm, there is a semi finals of championship video games that i like so i will look it, and after i will continue my work on nSPV support with the gaming SDK


[03-Nov-19 01:23 AM] Slyris#2880
once is done programatically, i will ask @naezith to do the Graphical Part, for that i will add an IMGUI support into the SDK.

You will be able to visualize your wallet from your game with a Debug tool inside the SDK directly

Should we be able to run multiple nSPV instances on different coins, where only support for one instance of nSPV at a time? @ca333 ?


[03-Nov-19 09:00 AM] jl777c#5810
each nspv instance is designed to be lightweight, you can even consider running an instance per request, but likely it is better to run one per coin


[03-Nov-19 09:01 AM] Slyris#2880
Ok ! Thank's, will spawn a process each time we request a new coin nSPV client


[03-Nov-19 09:02 AM] Slyris#2880
I need to open on a different port each time alright ?


[03-Nov-19 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, each coin will need a different rpc port. it defaults to the coin default port, but you can override it with command line option


[03-Nov-19 09:14 AM] Slyris#2880
Mean different config file in the same directory @jl777c ?


[03-Nov-19 09:15 AM] Slyris#2880
Since we can have only one coins information in the config alright ?


[03-Nov-19 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
did you look at the coins file?


[03-Nov-19 09:20 AM] jl777c#5810
it would help you understand it a bit better, it is called "coins" file for a reason and not "coin" file


[03-Nov-19 09:36 AM] Slyris#2880
@jl777c Yeah it's like an array if i understand so we can have a single one, perfect


[03-Nov-19 11:24 AM] ca333#0333
in fact we have used appImage in the past - but it is a known security hell and the reason why we prefer statical linking over it @Slyris - our releases work on the major distros and IF we wanted to provide superior support for komodo-daemon it makes sense to push komodo to the distro-repos in order to give users the `apt-get install komodo` or analogue `dpkg` (or other package manager) option - this is actually what i told you in our DM conversation and why we don't appImage. This is also the main reason we will not use appImage for KMD distribution. For a game or something that is less critical it is maybe something handy to have - but still would i never install an appimage in my ENV. 

It is true that targeting linux desktop users is sometimes not the easiest due to the ***** number of users to number of distros ratio - but on the other hand solutions like appimage violate everything we actually like about linux ("trusted security updates, libraries, etc.") - **and thats what a hardcore unix user would be telling to a hardcore mac/win user. - a good advice** 

So i ll conclude: something like appImage can be offered for game-bundles (but keep in mind its not clean and certainly not the best - its the laziest method, not more) - you can use this stuff for sort of 'niche' applications where no other solutions for "easy" distribution  exists (when its really very complex or only a very small number of OSS deps are used). And the clean and professional path is: 
i) statically linked bins OR ii) bin tarballs that contain all dependencies or iii) unix/linux containers or docker like images (less preferred)

[03-Nov-19 11:34 AM] jl777c#5810
it did sound too good to be true


[03-Nov-19 11:38 AM] ca333#0333
It still has justified use-cases, etc. and i don't want to pull it into dirt (since its initial vision was to make app distribution simple for linux noobs) - amongst the core unix users it is really unliked and one of the less preferred methods. But it is convenient and very easy to use - so if security is no factor and has no priority than it likely can be used for less critical things on non-critical infrastructure and environments.


[03-Nov-19 11:42 AM] Slyris#2880
Yes it is sure that in the ideal the most friendly version for the user would be that when using our module we get a binary that can be directly launched without installed anything outside. If you can do it statically or with just tarballs without installing anything else it's great. Otherwise the user if he is on Linux should be able to install dependencies himself I am all to agree.


[03-Nov-19 11:44 AM] jl777c#5810
doing 2 static libs for libnspv doesnt seem so much


[03-Nov-19 11:44 AM] Slyris#2880
I really think that the one and only problem of static programs is the licensing of certain dependencies that prevents us.


[03-Nov-19 11:44 AM] ca333#0333
exactly - since some of the gamedevs that will be using our SDK likely won't be very deep into unix/linux application bundling and distribution we can still provide them `createDebPackage.sh` and `createRpmPackage.sh`, .... scripts to i) teach them how this would be done in a clean and optimal way and ii) give them an easy script to do it for them (they can still read it for sake of transparency/security)


[03-Nov-19 11:45 AM] Slyris#2880
@ca333 Ok deal, i agree on that.


[03-Nov-19 11:45 AM] Slyris#2880
I had in my old implementation of shiva an `./prepare_ubuntu_install.sh` that i was providing for Ubuntu users


[03-Nov-19 11:45 AM] Slyris#2880
People was happy with that.


[03-Nov-19 11:46 AM] ca333#0333
as for proprietary libraries and engines there are some options to provide a bundling method as clean as possible too - just get back to me whenever we want to finalize this "game distribution methods/scripts"


[03-Nov-19 11:46 AM] Slyris#2880
Honestly i think that most of our users will be on windows since we target game developer


[03-Nov-19 11:46 AM] Slyris#2880
I'm not sure, but we will do metrics at this time to know


[03-Nov-19 11:47 AM] Slyris#2880
but i think we will get less than 5% linux game developer


[03-Nov-19 11:48 AM] Slyris#2880
For the moment we are not at the game distribution stage, i'm on the first blockchain second layer trying to implement a wallet in game functionnality.


[03-Nov-19 11:49 AM] ca333#0333
either way appImage is something we can certainly also offer in the game SDK although its not optimal (but not for KMD software) - and some gamedev rookies/noobs will likely be VERY grateful for just having these easy options - otherwise it would be like us not willing to bundle for windows cuz we pre-assume windows is evil and insecure (which it is) - but still, for sake of system/lib agnosticism i think it makes sense to offer them as many options as possible.


[03-Nov-19 11:49 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah for game bundle it's will be ok i guess


[03-Nov-19 11:49 AM] ca333#0333
yea i agree - WIN will be the main OS for endusers (gamers)


[03-Nov-19 11:49 AM] Slyris#2880

You mean steam the game portal ?


[03-Nov-19 11:50 AM] ca333#0333
yes exactly


[03-Nov-19 11:50 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah but not on the blockchain part.


[03-Nov-19 11:50 AM] Slyris#2880
Or we will be banned


[03-Nov-19 11:50 AM] Slyris#2880
Or you need to discuss with them


[03-Nov-19 11:50 AM] ca333#0333
they have this in their Terms of Service? crazy!


[03-Nov-19 11:50 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah


[03-Nov-19 11:50 AM] Slyris#2880
blockchain mining is prevented


[03-Nov-19 11:50 AM] Slyris#2880
mostly because people was trying to add mining in game secretly


[03-Nov-19 11:50 AM] Slyris#2880
for getting money from users


[03-Nov-19 11:50 AM] Slyris#2880
but you can get in touch with them


[03-Nov-19 11:51 AM] ca333#0333
ok the game wouldn't be mining - and we would be using lightweight libraries such as NSPV


[03-Nov-19 11:51 AM] Slyris#2880
and speak about the project maybe we can have a derogation


[03-Nov-19 11:51 AM] ca333#0333
maybe we can test it out with a very simple game with an ingame wallet, etc.


[03-Nov-19 11:51 AM] ca333#0333
would make KMD the first blockchain game on Steam


[03-Nov-19 11:51 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah but imagine you want to create a game with an economy based on an assets from komodo


[03-Nov-19 11:51 AM] Slyris#2880
And you want to mine this money directly in game


[03-Nov-19 11:51 AM] Slyris#2880
Exactly like you create your money in game


[03-Nov-19 11:51 AM] Slyris#2880
By doing "actions"


[03-Nov-19 11:52 AM] ca333#0333
yea this would be ultra-fancy - but understandable that they re against it since it could screw the user-experience on Steam (sys-resource overload, etc.)


[03-Nov-19 11:52 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah OFC, but i don't know the area that they ban from blockchain exactly we need to ASK, i know mining is prevented


[03-Nov-19 11:52 AM] Slyris#2880
may be some other stuffs


[03-Nov-19 11:52 AM] Slyris#2880

how can accept a game


[03-Nov-19 12:21 PM] Slyris#2880
that create money explicitly in the game (users knows) and they will get nothing ?


[03-Nov-19 12:21 PM] Slyris#2880
For sure they will invent something to ban the game


[03-Nov-19 12:22 PM] Slyris#2880

just ctrl + f `fprintf(stderr` and then replace with the stream you prefer @Slyris

it's ok for me

i just wanted to know if it's was from my side


[05-Nov-19 10:47 AM] ca333#0333
pretty sure its in the code since you always have to specify the output stream explicitly to get "normal" output to stderr


[05-Nov-19 10:48 AM] ca333#0333
i remember we had issues in the past with the output buf not being properly flushed and leading to "stuck" outputs - just printing to stderr is likely a workaround/hackaround to prevent such issues


[05-Nov-19 10:48 AM] Slyris#2880
I mean i spawn the process from nspv that i compiled manually i didn't check the code of nspv yet

If you need it to another stream let me know - i can look into this

Already changed it for Komodo Team role and just removed your Team Admin role so won't be an issue for you again @Slyris

How to do a link to a file in rst with sphinx?
I am writing a documentation and I would like to include links to pdf files or zip archives. How can I achieve that using rst language and sphinx ?

If I do that

i will try this


[06-Nov-19 11:08 AM] Slyris#2880
@naezith Fixed, waiting for building docs on upstream


[06-Nov-19 11:08 AM] Slyris#2880
It's should be more good now


[07-Nov-19 12:50 AM] TonyL#3577
@Slyris @naezith I'm on another thing at least today-tomorrow, will wrap head over this manual right after it. On a brief view that looks great. Will try to follow and create a flappy bird game with some modifications üòÅ


[07-Nov-19 12:52 AM] TonyL#3577
@Sir Seven  Can you please also try to follow this manual https://antara-gaming-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/tutorials/flappy-bird.html ?


[07-Nov-19 01:03 AM] Slyris#2880
@TonyL I try to build dmg file for osx now to put it in the release

There is an installer for osx, prebuild for windows and prebuild for linux for people that don't want to build but just try !


[07-Nov-19 03:17 AM] Slyris#2880
So you can litteraly just download for your platform and run it...


[07-Nov-19 03:17 AM] Slyris#2880
The linux version will work only on Recent Linux Kernel (build on Ubuntu 19.04) (need to build on 16.04 for old libc)


[07-Nov-19 03:18 AM] Slyris#2880
I try to do a deb package too but without success for the moment


[07-Nov-19 03:18 AM] Slyris#2880
@naezith Can you give a try for the dmg file ?


[07-Nov-19 03:19 AM] naezith#9757
will try windows now


[07-Nov-19 03:19 AM] Slyris#2880
cool !


[07-Nov-19 03:29 AM] naezith#9757
just perfect


[07-Nov-19 03:29 AM] Slyris#2880
did you try the dmg too ?


[07-Nov-19 03:29 AM] naezith#9757
will do


[07-Nov-19 03:30 AM] Slyris#2880
cool


[07-Nov-19 03:56 AM] Slyris#2880

[07-Nov-19 04:01 AM] Slyris#2880
this


[07-Nov-19 04:02 AM] naezith#9757
when you go through steam, it doesn't happen


[07-Nov-19 04:02 AM] naezith#9757
üòÑ


[07-Nov-19 04:02 AM] naezith#9757
though I don't modify it for steam


[07-Nov-19 04:03 AM] naezith#9757
so dunno how that really works, my game opens through steam


[07-Nov-19 04:03 AM] naezith#9757
what OS thinks about it


[07-Nov-19 04:03 AM] naezith#9757
I don't even apply steamDRM


[07-Nov-19 04:03 AM] Slyris#2880
I personnaly followed this:


[07-Nov-19 04:03 AM] Slyris#2880
```
Mac OSX Drag and Drop generator. This generator creates a .DMG
disk image file that is populated by install() commands, as if it were
the install prefix.
To use this generator, create executable(s) with the MACOSX_BUNDLE option, and install them to the root of the package.  They will then show up when the DMG is opened, and the user can drag and drop them into their Applications folder.
You will probably want to add extra files to each application bundle, like an Info.plist and an icon.  To add your plist, specify it by setting the target property MACOSX_BUNDLE_PLIST on your bundle target.  To add other resource files, add them as source files to the bundle, and set the source property MACOSX_PACKAGE_LOCATION on them to choose where inside the bundle they'll go.
It is impossible to place multiple executables inside one single bundle
using this generator; it enforces a 1:1 bundle-to-executable relationship.  If you need this functionality, you should use the Bundle generator.  If your executable depends on additional shared libraries, you can include them by using fixup_bundle() from BundleUtilities.
```


[07-Nov-19 04:06 AM] Slyris#2880
Apparently


[07-Nov-19 04:06 AM] Slyris#2880
i need to do


[07-Nov-19 04:06 AM] Slyris#2880
```
codesign -s <identity> --keychain <full-path-to-keychain> <path-to-disk-image>
```


[07-Nov-19 04:11 AM] naezith#9757
I can give you guys some steam sale stats btw, useful info


[07-Nov-19 04:11 AM] naezith#9757
NDA normally but I won't include numbers


[07-Nov-19 04:13 AM] naezith#9757
from gross, first VAT cuts, then 30% belongs to steam, then withholding for that 30%. around 62% is being left with my numbers


[07-Nov-19 04:13 AM] naezith#9757
and US price tag is 10 usd,  with regional pricing, average price for my sales is 6 usd


[07-Nov-19 04:13 AM] naezith#9757
and I get 3.77 usd from each copy in avg

steam be like ^


[07-Nov-19 04:15 AM] Slyris#2880
@naezith In fact that incredible how as a indie dev you touch almost no money


[07-Nov-19 04:15 AM] Slyris#2880
I would highly prefer a decentralized game community portal like steam, with less fee's


[07-Nov-19 04:15 AM] Slyris#2880
It's probably coming in the next 10 years i hope


[07-Nov-19 04:15 AM] Slyris#2880
sincerely


[07-Nov-19 04:16 AM] naezith#9757
if I released on any other platform


[07-Nov-19 04:16 AM] Slyris#2880
30% when you are indie dev, it's really to much, i hope that with IFPS everything will change


[07-Nov-19 04:16 AM] naezith#9757
unit count would not be this high


[07-Nov-19 04:16 AM] Slyris#2880
I hope a steam build top on : https://ipfs.io

[07-Nov-19 04:17 AM] Slyris#2880
You build a steam build on top of IPFS i think the future will be great


[07-Nov-19 04:17 AM] Slyris#2880
and you take like 1-5% fees instead of 30%...

Once this will be done

you can imagine


[07-Nov-19 04:33 AM] Slyris#2880
ipfs://decentralized-steam.com


[07-Nov-19 04:34 AM] Slyris#2880
@naezith Trust me in the future one day it's will be like this


[07-Nov-19 04:34 AM] Slyris#2880
Brave have a wallet that will support more crypto in your browser


[07-Nov-19 04:34 AM] Slyris#2880
Your wallet, Your private Key, Your Identifier


[07-Nov-19 04:34 AM] Slyris#2880
No needs to have account to connect on a decentralized steam


[07-Nov-19 04:34 AM] Slyris#2880
Use your wallet.


[07-Nov-19 04:34 AM] naezith#9757
aa we talked to this brave guys in mwc


[07-Nov-19 04:35 AM] naezith#9757
hossain did


[07-Nov-19 04:35 AM] Slyris#2880
Brave is an example.


[07-Nov-19 04:35 AM] Slyris#2880
But I  believe chromium will follow


[07-Nov-19 04:35 AM] Slyris#2880
Opera probably


[07-Nov-19 04:35 AM] Slyris#2880
Not sure about Chrome, Firefox


[07-Nov-19 04:35 AM] Slyris#2880
But let's say in 10 years


[07-Nov-19 04:35 AM] Slyris#2880
You go to ipfs://decentralized-steam.com


[07-Nov-19 04:36 AM] Slyris#2880
Automatically loaded because of your browser wallet


[07-Nov-19 04:36 AM] Slyris#2880
So you know which game you have access


[07-Nov-19 04:36 AM] Slyris#2880
you click one button to dl your games


[07-Nov-19 04:36 AM] Slyris#2880
No need of desktop application


[07-Nov-19 04:36 AM] Slyris#2880
Because ifps is peer to peer


[07-Nov-19 04:36 AM] Slyris#2880
files are directly downloaded from the decentralized web


[07-Nov-19 04:36 AM] Slyris#2880
to your local computer


[07-Nov-19 04:36 AM] Slyris#2880
Let's say someone publish a game on this decentralized steam


[07-Nov-19 04:37 AM] Slyris#2880
He will ask for price, accepting crypto or not, fiat, paypal etc


[07-Nov-19 04:37 AM] Slyris#2880
He will put his "settings"


[07-Nov-19 04:39 AM] Slyris#2880
Since you are recognized with your wallet


[07-Nov-19 04:39 AM] Slyris#2880
You can buy anonymously using cryptos if the sellers accept, or use fiat credit card or paypal if sellers require it


[07-Nov-19 04:40 AM] Slyris#2880
Transaction authorized, you can download your files.


[07-Nov-19 04:40 AM] Slyris#2880
Since you have your private key's, you can do it from every computer you want, just recover your wallet with your private key on another computer


[07-Nov-19 04:40 AM] Slyris#2880
and you have access to all your games


[07-Nov-19 04:40 AM] Slyris#2880
It's the ideal world, ideal solution


[07-Nov-19 04:41 AM] Slyris#2880
Not sure it's yet possible


[07-Nov-19 04:41 AM] Slyris#2880
but in 10 years, probably.


[07-Nov-19 04:41 AM] naezith#9757
good guesses


[07-Nov-19 04:41 AM] Slyris#2880
I'm sure that if it's happening


[07-Nov-19 04:41 AM] Slyris#2880
Steam will have non sense anymore


[07-Nov-19 04:42 AM] naezith#9757
there are so many steam alternatives today too


[07-Nov-19 04:42 AM] Slyris#2880
They are all centralized and expensive fees


[07-Nov-19 04:42 AM] naezith#9757
no


[07-Nov-19 04:42 AM] Slyris#2880

Not exactly


[07-Nov-19 04:43 AM] Slyris#2880
Itch io is not a game portal


[07-Nov-19 04:43 AM] Slyris#2880
you can download game that's true


[07-Nov-19 04:43 AM] Slyris#2880
but steam have juicy stuff


[07-Nov-19 04:43 AM] Slyris#2880
Such as rewards, game extension etc


[07-Nov-19 04:43 AM] Slyris#2880
That's make the difference


[07-Nov-19 04:43 AM] Slyris#2880
As i say, the rest of feature of steam are just masturbatic stuff


[07-Nov-19 04:44 AM] Slyris#2880
Rewards, Game Extension, Community etc


[07-Nov-19 04:44 AM] naezith#9757
friendlist and chat is important


[07-Nov-19 04:44 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah


[07-Nov-19 04:44 AM] Slyris#2880
Also


[07-Nov-19 04:44 AM] Slyris#2880
but all of this stuff


[07-Nov-19 04:44 AM] Slyris#2880
are trivial


[07-Nov-19 04:44 AM] Slyris#2880
Long time to code, but nothing complicated


[07-Nov-19 04:45 AM] Slyris#2880
Itch.io doesn't support update


[07-Nov-19 04:45 AM] Slyris#2880
Means you buy a game


[07-Nov-19 04:45 AM] Slyris#2880
you don't know when they update


[07-Nov-19 04:45 AM] Slyris#2880
When there is a bugfix etc


[07-Nov-19 04:45 AM] Slyris#2880
But yeah the idea of itch.io is great

Itchi.io don't keep client's happy but make the indie dev happy.

The feedbacks are good overall, only there are according to readers many repetitions of words or badly spoken sentences, if possible to have a full and detailed return of a native English?

Small focus of the evening: Added animated sprite, minor bug fixes. We want to add the possibility of loading resources in background and the addition of a transition scene between two game scenes (for the loading resources in background precisely). Currently working on a reproduction of the Wolf3D, tweaking the Flappy Birds with the assets given by ca333 (waiting for the receipt of textures at the correct size).

In the next big steps there will be a redesign of the audio system which is too basic for the moment.

Otherwise I think that given the results we have for the moment it is all possible to make games with the SDK currently, but it is true that we would need a more robust audio system and can be more tool for physics. We have not really thought about what we will offer for all GUI and UI, it's not an easy part.

@naezith Is on the wolf, i'm on the nspv part :p


[14-Nov-19 04:19 PM] Slyris#2880
The blockchain part is not complicated but it requires a lot of small things that I had not thought at first. (Wif wallet encryption, HTTP library to communicate with NSPV binary, correct multiprocess handling with IO streams inheritance


[14-Nov-19 04:21 PM] Slyris#2880
And all must stay in the correct performance, there is even a moment when the nSPV action issues in non-blocking of the game (it is not necessary that an action that uses nSPV blocks the game the time to have the answer of the rpc command)


[14-Nov-19 04:22 PM] Slyris#2880
So we would have guessed it will certainly be necessary that the actions of the service nSPV is executed in background (thread) to be non-blocking. For the moment i implement the naive way (blocking), and will see later for non blocking


[14-Nov-19 04:23 PM] Slyris#2880
And the same question will arise for people who want to use nSPV in other engines like unity etc


[14-Nov-19 04:26 PM] Slyris#2880
@ca333 You can follow this feature in the following PR: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/antara-gaming-sdk/pull/142

When it's will be merged means that the feature will be ready to use.

I will basically try to spend RICK directly from my game simulating a buy in a game shop


[14-Nov-19 04:32 PM] Slyris#2880
So i will create a shop class with sell/buy public member function that have item with a cost price in RICK blabla


[14-Nov-19 04:32 PM] Slyris#2880
The shop will have an nspv instance (for receiving money) and the player will also have an nspv instance for sending money

Hello @TonyL or @Sir Seven I plan to support WIF Wallet key through environment variable as possibility for the user

Before launching your game, you can set an environment variable, and it's will be automatically detected by the system and used.

Support through filesystem will be available too.


[16-Nov-19 12:48 AM] Slyris#2880
It's look like:

```cpp
 //! Login
        auto wif = std::getenv("SECRET_WIF_WALLET");
        CHECK_NOTNULL_F(wif);
        auto answer = blockchain::nspv_api::login(nspv_system.get_endpoint("RICK"), wif);
```

[16-Nov-19 03:49 AM] Slyris#2880
We agree that in the case of an already existing wallet, the only way to have the public address of the wallet is to use the `login rpc` function?

```cpp
 //! Login
        auto wif = std::getenv("SECRET_WIF_WALLET");
        CHECK_NOTNULL_F(wif);
        auto endpoint = nspv_system.get_endpoint("RICK");
        auto answer = blockchain::nspv_api::login(endpoint, wif);
        CHECK_NE(answer.rpc_result_code, -1);

        auto unspent_answer =  blockchain::nspv_api::listunspent(endpoint, answer.address);
        CHECK_NE(unspent_answer.rpc_result_code, -1);
        CHECK_GT(unspent_answer.balance, 0.0);
```


[16-Nov-19 03:50 AM] Slyris#2880
Because once i login with the wif, i have access to my pubkey (i need it to call other rpc function)

In case where we create a wallet the `getnewaddress` give me this address, but otherwise, i guess that i have to login to get those information


[16-Nov-19 03:51 AM] Slyris#2880
@Sir Seven Ok since the pr is merged, just let me know once the prebuild binaries are available with the new config, (i guess it's automatic once you trigger the CI ?)


[16-Nov-19 04:01 AM] Sir Seven#7158
@Slyris Should be up in ~30 minutes on release page.


[16-Nov-19 09:15 AM] Slyris#2880
get balance + listunspent done


[16-Nov-19 09:16 AM] Slyris#2880
```cpp
CHECK_GT(nspv_system.get_balance("RICK"), 0.0);
```

I added a convenient get_balance function, you give the coin name, it's take automatically the pub address from the last login

what is difficult for monster @naezith ? IA ?


[23-Nov-19 06:51 AM] Slyris#2880
Because we have scripting in the box (lua)


[23-Nov-19 06:57 AM] Slyris#2880
```
- generate maze dynamically (I don't know how, will take time)
- have thin walls (might force our wall rendering to be drawn pixel by pixel which will drop the fps)
- have diagonal walls (same as above)
- have transparent walls (same as above)
- add a monster which will slowly follow while you run through the maze (so much work here, monster itself, pathfinding, sound effects, graphics, death game state, restart game etc.)
- have a weapon and many more enemies (big task like above)
```

I put it here as a reminder @naezith


[23-Nov-19 06:58 AM] Slyris#2880
But adding 3 kmd coins with a sound effect when you take it, and a 3D sound for portal when you are near or far from it should be possible in a short amount of time


[23-Nov-19 06:59 AM] Slyris#2880
have a weapon in fact is very easy and a easy task, it's just a 2D animation.

For the monster i don't know how much time it's could take.

We also have an example (blockchain + gaming sdk) to write this week (next week) with @naezith


[23-Nov-19 07:01 AM] Slyris#2880
+ need to add support for windows blockchain module using nspv


[23-Nov-19 07:03 AM] jl777c#5810
rogue code has random maze creation


[23-Nov-19 07:03 AM] jl777c#5810
and monsters that follow you


[23-Nov-19 07:04 AM] Slyris#2880
To be clear, everything is possible monster and random maze generation. We will just need a bit more time.


[23-Nov-19 07:04 AM] Slyris#2880
so i would let @ca333 choose if he want to give us an extra amount of time for those extra features. But i keep in mind that this is just an example of the possibility using the SDK.


[23-Nov-19 07:05 AM] Slyris#2880
Ideally we can turn the wolf3d into a rogue like with blockchain support if it's the final goal


[23-Nov-19 07:08 AM] Slyris#2880
Our vision was to make a small example of wolf3D with a scary atmosphere. The idea was to get out of the labyrinth before the monsters caught up the player. All through the different portals to change level.


[23-Nov-19 07:09 AM] Slyris#2880
If for example we record the time of a single game run, we could save the scores on the blockchain and make a ranking, it would be a good example.


[23-Nov-19 07:11 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[23-Nov-19 07:16 AM] naezith#9757
yeah it just would take more time, that's it


[23-Nov-19 07:16 AM] naezith#9757
if you think it's worth, we can continue


[23-Nov-19 07:16 AM] naezith#9757
but current version is also very sufficient


[23-Nov-19 07:17 AM] naezith#9757
there are more important stuff to do


[23-Nov-19 07:18 AM] naezith#9757
kmd coins and 3D portal sound are useful and not that hard, we should add them


[23-Nov-19 07:18 AM] jl777c#5810
no need, it is for a demo


[23-Nov-19 07:18 AM] naezith#9757
yeah exactly


[23-Nov-19 07:18 AM] jl777c#5810
i just suggested rogue to have the parts you said would take a while


[24-Nov-19 07:24 AM] Audo#5667
if we can place those KMD coins to the game and link them to blockchain, so that they are real KMD, then  we would have a demo that showcases a blockchain element also.

Maybe adding monsters to the game could be something we ask our community to develop if there's someone who's interested in that. With or without a bounty.

They're playing Blockchain De. we've met "chromia" before.

https://twitter.com/teamchromia/status/1175003938183110656

"Riccardo Sibani" chromiada "developer" wanted to code in the game for early access.
@naezith @Slyris 
we can check the early access code together.


[25-Nov-19 03:51 AM] Paro#7842
I don't know how they are making a "blockchain" game.

@jl777c Someone send me that about blockchain and gaming, do you think it's a good use case ?


[25-Nov-19 04:55 AM] Slyris#2880
or even possible ?


[25-Nov-19 04:58 AM] jl777c#5810
its possible


[25-Nov-19 05:00 AM] Slyris#2880
basically the guy tell me that he want to do that for not paying centralized server to achieve the same job


[25-Nov-19 05:00 AM] Slyris#2880
(games are hosted by one of the players that are looking for a match)


[25-Nov-19 05:00 AM] Slyris#2880
```
i want distributed matchmaking and item servers
becaus i dont want to pay for them
imagine call of duty
```


[25-Nov-19 05:01 AM] Slyris#2880
I write a note about it for a good use case example.


[25-Nov-19 05:19 AM] TonyL#3577
Very interesting usecase to count MMR by tokentransfers but you need custom tokens with transfers allowed only by gamefinishing events (possibility of trading or transferring of ELO doesn't have sense)


[25-Nov-19 06:10 AM] Slyris#2880
@TonyL I think that our technology can cover such this interesting case, we will see in future which kind of example we want to do for the SDK, this one can be interesting

not required @Slyris - users can just confirm the execution of unsigned (trusted) executables

we are already enrolled for the apple dev program and utilize such signing certificates for specific software releases - for this gaming SDK and related software its not required yet..


[01-Dec-19 12:53 PM] naezith#9757
I don't know how Steam handles it, I upload the files to the site. then user downloads the game but it's not dmg. it's just downloading the files into a folder. and at the site you type the executable name and args. when user opens the game, steam runs that executable with those args I guess


[01-Dec-19 12:54 PM] naezith#9757
game is not being installed to Applications I think


[01-Dec-19 12:54 PM] naezith#9757

[01-Dec-19 12:54 PM] Slyris#2880
Yeah but it's a nightmare you you give the dependencies


[01-Dec-19 12:54 PM] Slyris#2880
Apple Take care about the dependencies for you, during the bundle creation


[01-Dec-19 12:54 PM] Slyris#2880
he will fix symlink, rpath etc


[01-Dec-19 12:59 PM] Slyris#2880
We must be careful in any case, because Apple becomes more and more difficult with each new version the security goes up a notch, soon it is sure it will be completely forbidden to open an unsigned application. Apple GateKeeper is more and more restrictive.

On the forums it really starts to get on Apple. Explaining that they who were the friend of the devs, now become more and more restrictive. (In fact it's ok if you stay in the Apple universe with XCode) But as soon as you want to do something else, you have security and problems everywhere.

@TonyL Some of our users had some problems after upgrading to Catalina etc if i remember.

I think we should move tutorial into another repo, like Hub


[01-Dec-19 01:17 PM] Slyris#2880
But anyway i increased the PATH_MAX variable so it's compile now

@TonyL Should i release Linux 19.04 binaries meanwhile this time ?


[01-Dec-19 01:49 PM] TonyL#3577
I think it's better to wait for building/testing on some older release


[01-Dec-19 01:50 PM] Slyris#2880
oki


[01-Dec-19 01:50 PM] Slyris#2880
i will install a 16.04 as vm i think

Sp far you're the only person who I know on 19.04 üôÇ

[01-Dec-19 01:50 PM] Slyris#2880
i was on 19.04


[01-Dec-19 01:50 PM] Slyris#2880
and not on 19.10


[01-Dec-19 01:51 PM] TonyL#3577

[01-Dec-19 01:51 PM] Slyris#2880
OH IM SO STUPID


[01-Dec-19 01:51 PM] Slyris#2880
i can build it on wsl 16.04


[01-Dec-19 01:51 PM] Slyris#2880
i think


[01-Dec-19 01:53 PM] TonyL#3577
16.04 is great, don't think many of users are on 14.04 despite the fact it's still in LTS


[01-Dec-19 01:56 PM] Slyris#2880
stay around @TonyL Once is build i give it to you

@TonyL You will not believe me. I have to upgrade to Windows 10 Insider Preview 19033.1 because WSL doesn't support Fuse, i need WSL2

Oh, it's better to use VM I think. Not realsed at first that you going to use some windows virtualization 
You can release it tomorrow I believe - anyway it's Sunday's night

I think it's better with beer, pizza stuff like that, and low price


[02-Dec-19 06:17 AM] Slyris#2880
so we can test it more

[02-Dec-19 09:40 AM] naezith#9757
@ca333 there is one thing to decide


[02-Dec-19 09:40 AM] naezith#9757
lets say store balance is 500


[02-Dec-19 09:40 AM] naezith#9757
user balance is 1000


[02-Dec-19 09:40 AM] naezith#9757
user buys something for 10


[02-Dec-19 09:40 AM] naezith#9757
how should we display the balances


[02-Dec-19 09:41 AM] naezith#9757
first option: 510 (+10) and 990 (-10)


[02-Dec-19 09:41 AM] naezith#9757
second option: 500 (+10) and 1000 (-10)


[02-Dec-19 09:42 AM] naezith#9757
third option: 510 (-10) and 990 (+10)


[02-Dec-19 09:43 AM] naezith#9757
I'd pick first option because that's the practical balance which user can use


[02-Dec-19 09:47 AM] ca333#0333
will get back to you ref. this and another topic shortly in DM @naezith

Really nice job, we integrate nSPV tommorow with this front-end !


[03-Dec-19 05:03 AM] naezith#9757
@ca333 it's normal that sender's balance becomes 0 after sending right?

nspv


[03-Dec-19 05:03 AM] naezith#9757
during the lock


[03-Dec-19 05:06 AM] naezith#9757
8-9 mins it took


[03-Dec-19 05:06 AM] naezith#9757
for balances to become normal again

I remember it from sec wallet I was coding


[03-Dec-19 05:08 AM] Slyris#2880
yes but the get balance return 0 during 9-10 min, as a player i will make a crisis if i see my balance at zero


[03-Dec-19 05:08 AM] naezith#9757
client-side balance will be different


[03-Dec-19 05:09 AM] naezith#9757
won't get updated to 0


[03-Dec-19 05:09 AM] Slyris#2880
how we make the difference between a locking 0 balance wallet and an empty one


[03-Dec-19 05:09 AM] naezith#9757
update only when there is no pending transc


[03-Dec-19 05:09 AM] Slyris#2880
ah yes good idea


[03-Dec-19 05:09 AM] Slyris#2880

then goes normal 1 if I send something, or 0 if there isn't anything


[03-Dec-19 06:09 AM] naezith#9757
after it ends, balances are updated, transaction is complete


[03-Dec-19 06:09 AM] naezith#9757
mempool is still being 1-2 or 2149


[03-Dec-19 06:10 AM] naezith#9757
what is the best way to know the transaction count


[03-Dec-19 06:10 AM] naezith#9757
pending


[03-Dec-19 06:12 AM] naezith#9757
mempool is not the best way I guess


[03-Dec-19 06:13 AM] naezith#9757
not reliable


[03-Dec-19 06:13 AM] naezith#9757

2149 transactions in mempool
2149 transactions in mempool. GitHub Gist: instantly share code, notes, and snippets.

[03-Dec-19 07:04 AM] naezith#9757
2149 happens sometimes when there isn't any transaction


[03-Dec-19 07:05 AM] naezith#9757
for the unconfirmed balance, we need to go through all of them and accumulate the amounts


[03-Dec-19 07:05 AM] naezith#9757
as I understood


[03-Dec-19 07:06 AM] naezith#9757
but that number is odd


[03-Dec-19 07:09 AM] ca333#0333
no need to overthink/overkill it - after all its just for demonstration purposes ref. the libNSPV functionality and how to receive/send coins from within a game. I assume this is covered by this fakeshop.


[03-Dec-19 07:19 AM] naezith#9757
yeah then we can call it done


[03-Dec-19 07:19 AM] naezith#9757
it does the basic stuff


[03-Dec-19 07:19 AM] naezith#9757
and it's async


[03-Dec-19 07:19 AM] Slyris#2880
send/receive work right now @ca333 + async


[03-Dec-19 07:47 AM] ca333#0333
ok - in this case its done if the basic functionality is covered (send/receive/checkbalance)

[12-Dec-19 06:55 AM] naezith#9757
is there any trick to achieve this with 2 GB


[12-Dec-19 06:56 AM] naezith#9757
or should I go for t2.medium


[12-Dec-19 06:57 AM] gcharang#6833
4gb ram + 4 gb swap should work
recommended ram is 8 gb to build KMD


[12-Dec-19 06:58 AM] naezith#9757
okay


[12-Dec-19 06:58 AM] naezith#9757
previous version was working with 2 GB though


[12-Dec-19 06:58 AM] naezith#9757
I'd rather try medium with 4 gb first, so we can keep cost low if possible


[12-Dec-19 06:59 AM] gcharang#6833
ok, then 4gb ram + 4 gb swap space should do the trick


[12-Dec-19 06:59 AM] cipi#4502
it could work with 2gb too, but you need to build with `./zcutil/build.sh -j1`, so it uses only one thread


[12-Dec-19 06:59 AM] naezith#9757
hmm swap place I am not sure how to set up


[12-Dec-19 07:00 AM] naezith#9757
ah okay I'll try that


[12-Dec-19 07:00 AM] naezith#9757
@cipi but I did `zcutil/build.sh` without any params


[12-Dec-19 07:00 AM] naezith#9757
is it same as `-j1` ?


[12-Dec-19 07:02 AM] cipi#4502
not sure, i know i had to do this to compile on some low mem machines... but maybe it also depends on the number of actual cores (`cat /proc/cpuinfo`)


[12-Dec-19 07:03 AM] naezith#9757
okay I'll just try -j1


[12-Dec-19 07:03 AM] cipi#4502
with `-j1` you make sure it always uses only one thread... and normally 2GB should be enough for 1 gcc thread


[12-Dec-19 07:03 AM] naezith#9757
alright thank you so much


[12-Dec-19 07:03 AM] naezith#9757
will tell if it blows up again


[12-Dec-19 07:06 AM] naezith#9757
yes, failed again

[12-Dec-19 07:07 AM] cipi#4502
damn... pretty sure there is only some 500 MB lacking to get it compile...


[12-Dec-19 07:07 AM] naezith#9757
htop also shows that there is plenty of memory available if I'm not reading wrong


[12-Dec-19 07:08 AM] gcharang#6833
<https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-swap-space-on-ubuntu-16-04>
can try enabling swap


[12-Dec-19 07:08 AM] naezith#9757
this is AWS stuff, kinda different than normal VPS


[12-Dec-19 07:08 AM] naezith#9757
I'll search for swap too after this


[12-Dec-19 07:09 AM] naezith#9757
but cipi says 500 mb is enough @gcharang


[12-Dec-19 07:09 AM] cipi#4502
what is `snapd`? is there stuff that uses RAM (`RES`), that you can stop?

there isn't really much you can save... only this snapd, but i guess it will not be enough... and even if, chances are high it will fail the next time if we are operating on the edge

is there a "latest" url for this


[12-Dec-19 07:19 AM] naezith#9757
anyways not needed


[12-Dec-19 07:29 AM] ca333#0333

yes but the direct download link

tar file


[12-Dec-19 07:33 AM] naezith#9757
anyways it's not needed atm


[12-Dec-19 07:34 AM] naezith#9757
fetch-params.sh is supposed to be in zcutil folder I guess, I'll manually move it there


[12-Dec-19 07:37 AM] naezith#9757
just to make sure it's all good


[12-Dec-19 07:37 AM] naezith#9757

## Install Komodo
mkdir /home/ubuntu/komodo
wget -qO- https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/releases/download/0.5.0/komodo_0.5.0_linux.tar.gz | tar xvz -C /home/ubuntu/komodo
cd /home/ubuntu/komodo
mv /home/ubuntu/komodo/linux64/* /home/ubuntu/komodo/
rm -rf /home/ubuntu/komodo/linux64
mkdir /home/ubuntu/komodo/zcutil
mv /home/ubuntu/komodo/fetch-params.sh  /home/ubuntu/komodo/zcutil/fetch-params.sh
/home/ubuntu/komodo/zcutil/fetch-params.sh 
```


[12-Dec-19 07:38 AM] naezith#9757
this is the full setup right?


[12-Dec-19 07:40 AM] naezith#9757
this will be great, a lot faster than building


[12-Dec-19 07:40 AM] naezith#9757
faster tests


[12-Dec-19 07:41 AM] Sir Seven#7158
```
mkdir /home/ubuntu/komodo/zcutil
mv /home/ubuntu/komodo/fetch-params.sh  /home/ubuntu/komodo/zcutil/fetch-params.sh
```
You can run fetch-params script from anywhere, it doesn't really matter.


[12-Dec-19 07:42 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Otherwise - almost full installation, please do not forget about .komodo configs.


[12-Dec-19 07:43 AM] naezith#9757
I'm making `/home/ubuntu/.komodo/komodo.conf`


[12-Dec-19 07:43 AM] naezith#9757
if that's what you mean


[12-Dec-19 07:43 AM] naezith#9757
anything else?


[12-Dec-19 07:43 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Yep.


[12-Dec-19 07:43 AM] naezith#9757
alright thanks


[12-Dec-19 07:44 AM] naezith#9757
I better keep it in zcutil, some other thing might ask for that path


[12-Dec-19 07:44 AM] naezith#9757
no cost anyways


[12-Dec-19 07:44 AM] naezith#9757
oh wait it's not okay at all, those two binaries should be in `komodo/src/`


[12-Dec-19 07:48 AM] naezith#9757

[12-Dec-19 07:48 AM] naezith#9757
this should be equivalent to building it I think

[12-Dec-19 08:15 AM] naezith#9757
says 3.0


[12-Dec-19 08:15 AM] naezith#9757
hmm is there a way to get `5.0`


[12-Dec-19 08:15 AM] naezith#9757
@ca333


[12-Dec-19 08:16 AM] naezith#9757
since we manually put the url with 5.0, I'll enter this manually too I guess


[12-Dec-19 08:27 AM] ca333#0333
3.0.0 is ok - thats the daemon version


[12-Dec-19 08:27 AM] ca333#0333
0.5.0 is the KMD version


[12-Dec-19 08:27 AM] ca333#0333
@naezith ^


[12-Dec-19 08:28 AM] naezith#9757
```
echo -n 0.5.0 > /home/ubuntu/komodo_version.txt
wget -qO- https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/releases/download/0.5.0/komodo_0.5.0_linux.tar.gz | tar xvz -C /home/ubuntu/komodo
```


[12-Dec-19 08:28 AM] naezith#9757
we will manually edit this then


[12-Dec-19 08:28 AM] naezith#9757
since there is no way to get that programmatically


[12-Dec-19 08:29 AM] naezith#9757
I'll read from that file


[12-Dec-19 08:39 AM] ca333#0333
`getinfo` call returns you KMD version


[12-Dec-19 08:47 AM] naezith#9757
yeah but I don't want to fully launch komodod


[12-Dec-19 08:47 AM] naezith#9757
this is the template AMI


[12-Dec-19 08:47 AM] naezith#9757
anyways its fine


[12-Dec-19 08:47 AM] naezith#9757
I just read it from the file


[12-Dec-19 08:47 AM] ca333#0333
ok - yea reading out from file name works too - i am keeping this format komodo_<version>_linux.tar.gz


[12-Dec-19 08:49 AM] naezith#9757
file is not being created, it's directly passed to tar, I meant 
`echo -n 0.5.0 > /home/ubuntu/komodo_version.txt` above it


[12-Dec-19 08:49 AM] naezith#9757
it's fine though np, URL is also not `latest` url so we have to change it every time


[12-Dec-19 08:49 AM] naezith#9757
both


[12-Dec-19 09:27 AM] ca333#0333
https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/releases/latest will always route you to the latest version which has a tag that does equal the KMD version

I need the full instructions of updating an existing komodo installation:

```
mkdir /home/ubuntu/komodo_update
wget -qO- https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/releases/download/0.5.0/komodo_0.5.0_linux.tar.gz | tar xvz -C /home/ubuntu/komodo_update
mv /home/ubuntu/komodo_update/linux64/komodod /home/ubuntu/komodo/src
mv /home/ubuntu/komodo_update/linux64/komodo-cli /home/ubuntu/komodo/src
mv /home/ubuntu/komodo_update/linux64/fetch-params.sh /home/ubuntu/komodo/zcutil/
rm -rf /home/ubuntu/komodo_update
```

this will replace 3 files: `komodod`, `komodo-cli`, `fetch-params.sh`

 @ca333 @TonyL


[13-Dec-19 05:11 AM] naezith#9757
what other actions should be taken after this


[13-Dec-19 05:11 AM] naezith#9757
will restart the whole server at the very end, that will make the komodod open at launch


[13-Dec-19 05:11 AM] naezith#9757
but for example, is it needed to execute `fetch-params.sh`


[13-Dec-19 05:12 AM] naezith#9757
or do anything else


[13-Dec-19 05:15 AM] naezith#9757
I don't even need to stop komodod before replacing it with the new one I assume


[13-Dec-19 05:17 AM] naezith#9757
is this complete?
```sh
mkdir /home/ubuntu/komodo_update
wget -qO- https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/releases/download/0.5.0/komodo_0.5.0_linux.tar.gz | tar xvz -C /home/ubuntu/komodo_update

mv /home/ubuntu/komodo_update/linux64/komodo-cli /home/ubuntu/komodo/src
mv /home/ubuntu/komodo_update/linux64/fetch-params.sh /home/ubuntu/komodo/zcutil/

/home/ubuntu/komodo/zcutil/fetch-params.sh 
```


[13-Dec-19 05:24 AM] TonyL#3577
For daemon update you no need to execute params downloading script because it‚Äôs already downloaded


[13-Dec-19 05:24 AM] TonyL#3577
Just replace binaries and stop/start daemon


[13-Dec-19 05:24 AM] naezith#9757
is there any harm at executing it, guess not


[13-Dec-19 05:25 AM] naezith#9757
maybe something new needs to be downloaded I thought


[13-Dec-19 05:25 AM] naezith#9757
that's not a possibility?


[13-Dec-19 05:25 AM] TonyL#3577
No any harm, it‚Äôll just say that params already downloaded

[13-Dec-19 03:33 PM] Alright#0419
@naezith if that PR is to be merged and the assetchains.json from it is to be used, the `ac_pubkey` line from THC params must not be removed.


[13-Dec-19 03:34 PM] Alright#0419
it was removed from HUSH3 params as well


[13-Dec-19 03:35 PM] Alright#0419
`-ac_pubkey=` is the founder's reward address, it's part of consensus and must not be changed. Have a feeling you're confusing it with `-pubkey=` maybe?


[13-Dec-19 03:36 PM] Alright#0419
`ac_end 0 case is a bit complicated since code handles multiple eras etc, if it's not doing any harm, I'd rather keep it with others as it works good atm`
it's not doing any harm at all. It's literally doing nothing. The chain is exactly the same without it


[13-Dec-19 03:36 PM] Alright#0419
and I mean *exactly*. You can remove it from params all together and it will still sync with nodes who have it in params


[13-Dec-19 03:39 PM] Alright#0419
just to clarify, 
` ./komodod -pubkey=$pubkey -ac_name=NZT48 -ac_supply=250000 -ac_reward=100000000 -ac_end=0 -ac_halving=1000000 -ac_decay=50000000 -addnode=52.211.19.132 &`


` ./komodod -pubkey=$pubkey -ac_name=NZT48 -ac_supply=250000 -ac_reward=100000000 -ac_halving=1000000 -ac_decay=50000000 -addnode=52.211.19.132 &` ( no ac_end at all )

These are both the same exact chain and will sync to each other. The `ac_end=0` is just fluff and will do nothing. That's all I was trying to point out


[13-Dec-19 05:09 PM] naezith#9757
yes yes I understood


[13-Dec-19 05:09 PM] naezith#9757
but the way I'm handling them in code is a bit complicated


[13-Dec-19 05:10 PM] naezith#9757
about merging stuff, whoever does the merge should be aware


[13-Dec-19 05:15 PM] Alright#0419
do you have something automatically removing ac_pubkey from chains in assetchains.json/assetchains.old?


[13-Dec-19 05:15 PM] Alright#0419
or did someone manually do that


[14-Dec-19 01:46 AM] naezith#9757
hmm no as I remember


[14-Dec-19 01:47 AM] naezith#9757

How easy would it be to build a blockchain element into a game like this? https://www.minetest.net/

> Minetest is meant to be modded. Mods can add or change functionality and content.

I imagine there could be unique items that can be traded amongh the players, and of course an ingame currency. Perhaps an element of mining and digging up gold.


[15-Dec-19 08:18 PM] Audo#5667
_ _
but then I guess we wouldn't be making a game with the SDK, which defeats the purpose of building a reference game


[15-Dec-19 09:05 PM] Slyris#2880
@Audo since there is a Lua API it's will be to wrap a c++ module into a library and write a Lua module for it or directly use lua with our technology (nSPV for example) and use rpc.


[15-Dec-19 09:11 PM] Slyris#2880
So:

- Use lua HTTP to communicate directly with nSPV, mm2 or Komodod

- Build a Lua wrapper around a high level wrapper written in c++ with the SDK

- Build a Golang microservices that use gRPC to communicate with all of our product and use lua gRPC.


[15-Dec-19 09:15 PM] Slyris#2880
Basically the easiest way will be to communicate with Komodod with http/RPC call and use some CCs to store data on chain.

But it's heavy. 

Once we have CC's through nSPV it's will be more easy
