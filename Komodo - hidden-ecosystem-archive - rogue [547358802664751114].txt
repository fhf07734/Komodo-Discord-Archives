Hi üëã


[19-Feb-19 02:11 AM] CrisF#3405
```there are so many cases so more testers/testing needed```
Might be good to get some of the original players involved as testers?  They might be interested in promoting the revival of their game with modern tech. And possibly provided a base for the community?

**ROGUERS** 
Please update to latest version (jl777 and FSM are in sync). there are "hardforking" changes in gameplay interpretation and I will be enabling strict validation soon. When I do, if you are not running the latest, you will go on a fork

For multi-player:```be sure that you have latest daemon and update TUI
TUI have 3 new features: 
[6] Create new multiplayer game (you'll be asked for max players amount and buyin amount)
[7] Join (register) multiplayer game - it's scan chain for multiplayer game and asking for txid of game you want to join, then sending register
[8] Check my multiplayer games status / start - it's scanning for not finished multiplayer games you participating in, asking if you want to start any, if yes asking for game txid and starting rogue for this game
Then after you finish your rogue game it'll execute bailout if there is more than 1 player alive or highlander if you're last player alive
Amulet cases I'm not tracking yet```

[20-Feb-19 07:45 AM] SHossain#0007
you need to compile from latest source locally. daemon from Agama will not work

is this expected?


[20-Feb-19 08:10 AM] SHossain#0007
you are using macOS?


[20-Feb-19 08:10 AM] wookie#7663
yes


[20-Feb-19 08:10 AM] SHossain#0007
use `./zcutil/build-mac.sh -j8`


[20-Feb-19 08:10 AM] wookie#7663
oh, I only used -j4


[20-Feb-19 08:10 AM] wookie#7663
would that make a difference?

j4 is ok


[20-Feb-19 08:11 AM] SHossain#0007
i believe you used `./zcutil/build.sh -j4`


[20-Feb-19 08:11 AM] SHossain#0007
you need to use `build-mac.sh`

yes


[20-Feb-19 08:11 AM] wookie#7663

[20-Feb-19 08:11 AM] wookie#7663
you mean ./zcutil/build-mac.sh -j4

yes

not sure what I did wrong this time, but when I copy and paste the cmd to start the chain,
cd ~/komodo/src

 I get: 
-bash: ./komodod: No such file or directory


[20-Feb-19 08:43 AM] SHossain#0007
what were the last few lines after compile finished?


[20-Feb-19 08:44 AM] SHossain#0007
doesn't look like compile was finished

:Komodo:  **Hello Everyone!** 
I would really like to sort out some branding for The Rogue project.  I feel like we should really lock in a well chosen title for the project. I ended up putting "Rogue Chain" on twitter to get some accounts started, but i'm not happy with it.  I have a list put together for possible names to choose from and am open to more. I think selecting one banner to fly under is one of the most important things we can all decide on as it brings brand recognition, sets us apart from the other projects and shows strength as a community. 
 
I would like pretty much anyone's opinion so please feel free to tell what you like/do not like and WHY. 

Outside of my personal ideas I have seen Roguelike and Roguelander used alongside my current "Rogue Chain" . 

SO here is the list along with some comments from me. 
1 *Roguelander*  - what JL777c has named the multpilayer  game play(aka highlander can only be one.)
2 *Roguelike*  - Is a genre and technically... this game we have is ACTUALLY Rogue ..... so Roguelike as a title doesn't sit well for me.  
3 *RogueCC* - This grew on me over time, it showcases Crypto Conditions as the base of technology, it is short, simple and clear. It even has a nice ring to it and has this subconscious implication of being fast (500CC etc)  
4 *Rogue by Komodo*
5 *Komodo Rogue*
6 *KMD Rogue*
7 *Roguechain*
8 *Rogue Chain* (I'm personally burnt on the chain crypto names)
9 *Rogue Reinvented*
10(A) *Rogue Legacy*  - I really dig this one.
11 (B)*Chain Rogue*
12(C) *Crypto Rogue* 
13(D) *Rogue+*
14(E) *Rogue++*
Any other ideas?

[20-Feb-19 11:36 AM] nael55#5863
i got to 7 but keep losing access to warriors so continuously starting over


[20-Feb-19 11:37 AM] nael55#5863
anyone have an idea why this keeps happening?


[20-Feb-19 11:38 AM] TonyL#3577
How are you loosing em? Can you provide some game txid where you lost warrior?


[20-Feb-19 11:39 AM] TonyL#3577
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib games 17```
Is this call returning some txids in "games" ?


[20-Feb-19 11:40 AM] nael55#5863
i can't access them once i quit or when i die. sometimes after dying, i still can, but eventually i have always lost access


[20-Feb-19 11:40 AM] nael55#5863

[20-Feb-19 11:41 AM] nael55#5863

Hmm, all games are finished what means that bailout (quit game transaction) broadcasted


[20-Feb-19 11:42 AM] TonyL#3577
Please note txids of games which you find suspicious - game is still in testing so some bugs are possible


[20-Feb-19 11:43 AM] nael55#5863
does that explain why i'm losing access to warriors though?


[20-Feb-19 11:43 AM] nael55#5863
maybe i'm just not understanding game mechanics


[20-Feb-19 11:44 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe they are dying


[20-Feb-19 11:44 AM] TonyL#3577
To save warrior you need to quit dungeon by `shift + q` + `y` with alive warrior


[20-Feb-19 11:44 AM] TonyL#3577
And with gold > 0 and at least one monster killed


[20-Feb-19 11:44 AM] nael55#5863
ok once i die, then warrior is essentially deleted?


[20-Feb-19 11:44 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, when warrior dead he is dead


[20-Feb-19 11:45 AM] TonyL#3577
Token is burning and you can't use him anymore


[20-Feb-19 11:45 AM] nael55#5863
shift + q + y while i have a stash of gold should increase my rogue balance, right?


[20-Feb-19 11:45 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, 0.0005 ROGUE coins per 1 gold in singleplayer


[20-Feb-19 11:45 AM] nael55#5863
rogue token balance*


[20-Feb-19 11:46 AM] TonyL#3577
But your warrior should be alive


[20-Feb-19 11:46 AM] nael55#5863
right


[20-Feb-19 11:46 AM] nael55#5863
sometimes it updates but for my recent save my rogue balance didn't increase. had farmed about 500 gold


[20-Feb-19 11:46 AM] nael55#5863
can i see anywhere the otucome of a game? eg, how much rogue was earned?


[20-Feb-19 01:52 PM] TonyL#3577
If you're using TUI you can use `[0] Check current connection`


[20-Feb-19 01:52 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh I thought you're asking about total ROGUE balance


[20-Feb-19 01:53 PM] TonyL#3577
If you're playing singleplayer you should receive 0.0005 ROGUE per gold when succesfully quit the game but there is no such indication at the moment

When you're running the daemon you follow most of the commands in the guide, just remove ''./"


[22-Feb-19 11:18 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh yes, actually just usage of `.\` instead of `./` should make a trick
@andrew
Start ROGUE daemon in one cmd terminal, then In other terminal:
```.\komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE getaccountaddress ""
.\komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE validateaddress address^^
You'll get a `pubkey:` on this stage
.\komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE stop
```
Then restart ROGUE daemon with `-pubkey=pubkey_which_you_get_from_validateaddress` param

@Tylor zkFS  Ive been trying to think on how to answer your question. The money part I can not answer at all. As far as a GUI, someone will have to know how to work with ``C`` code and build from there, the game uses an engine called ``curses`` to create the current game interface.  There would also be some learning on the fly with the blockchain side of things as far as I know... JL777  can assist the GUI devs for ROGUE where *needed* (as well for new games to be put  on chain...)   There will be a GUI contest at some point soon for people to create one for our Crypto Rogue.....  a head start on that might pay off well.


[25-Feb-19 01:20 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
I think getting him involved right away will make huge payoffs in the future...I think he thinks hes gunna make a game on roblox and make 50k a week...maybe i will just let him fail/succeed and direct him from there

[26-Feb-19 11:01 AM] wookie#7663
is it possible to transfer items between warriors?


[26-Feb-19 11:01 AM] jl777c#5810
no. the rogue items arent unique in and of themselves, even if they are very rare


[26-Feb-19 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
for NFT, you want unique properties, which a player+pack will get


[26-Feb-19 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
now maybe there is a demand for FT so people can buy specific things like food, weapons, magics... but I think that would make the game too easy

Not if the in app purchases were for clothing and visual GUI things....I think I see a way....upgrading level s/weapons should be expensive and difficulty could also rise if i am understanding this D&D game correctly


[26-Feb-19 02:45 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
Just wondering if GUI should be updated to 3d and researching how to integrate with roblox...


[26-Feb-19 03:40 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@Tylor zkFS  any serious advancement of gameplay should be another game  really.


[26-Feb-19 03:40 PM] Cryptofist#7504
BUT if the talent is around.... D&D or other table tops are a great place to start for creating new games.

Favorite monster ability: "N" stole items, "A" weaken your armor, "L" give or stole gold,  "R" - strenght, "F" catch you,  "I" hypothermia, did I miss something?

[27-Feb-19 05:20 AM] ronyi#5719
Yes, but my english is not perfect, but if you proofread, then of course.


[27-Feb-19 05:33 AM] wookie#7663
@TonyL just to clarify, if I quit in the middle of fighting a monster, but my warrior is still alive, does my warrior get saved? I had 3 consecutive games where I quit and not get saved (the most painful loss was 3000+ gold, level 12)


[27-Feb-19 05:40 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Yes IF you got gold + killed at least one monster @wookie


[27-Feb-19 05:40 AM] Cryptofist#7504
OR it is supposed to be that way


[27-Feb-19 05:41 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Please let us know any time something like that happens, the devs might want more info so save the output print post game please.


[27-Feb-19 05:42 AM] Cryptofist#7504
ALSO, that sucks! I can send you some ROGUE if you want.


[27-Feb-19 06:15 AM] wookie#7663
@Cryptofist Yes. That happened yesterday. a level 12, 3000+ gold, a level 11 2000+ gold, and something else smaller. I thought it was resolved, but apparently it's still around. Is there a way for me to look up the post game output? I closed the windows terminal yesterday. @TonyL  this is using your 0.11n tui


[27-Feb-19 06:16 AM] Cryptofist#7504

You have to start daemon first for ROGUE chain: 
```./komodod -ac_name=ROGUE -ac_supply=1000000 -addnode=5.9.102.210  -ac_cclib=rogue -ac_perc=10000000 -ac_reward=100000000 -ac_cc=60001 -ac_script=2ea22c80203d1579313abe7d8ea85f48c65ea66fc512c878c0d0e6f6d54036669de940febf8103120c008203000401cc -daemon

And run daemon extracted from zip, and `./rogue_tui` executable from zip then


[06-Mar-19 09:05 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe you will need re-sync from scratch. For it just delete blockchain which you have now: 
```rm -rf ~/.komodo/ROGUE/blocks
rm -rf ~/.komodo/ROGUE/chainstate
rm -rf ~/.komodo/ROGUE/database```
And start daemon again

weird, i didnt even start rogue_tui. All i did was try to run ./rogue from the new extracted files and it asked me to put my rogue.conf in the current directory


[08-Mar-19 08:58 PM] Sdunbar#5064
so i did that and then ./rogue again and the game started up?


[08-Mar-19 08:58 PM] Sdunbar#5064
seems to work?


[08-Mar-19 08:58 PM] Sdunbar#5064
im guessing the chain is not running though?


[08-Mar-19 08:59 PM] Sdunbar#5064
i have no idea what im doing lol


[08-Mar-19 09:01 PM] Sdunbar#5064
Where is the rogue daemon in this package?


[08-Mar-19 09:21 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I believe you start with komodod


[08-Mar-19 09:21 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I'll take a look in a bit when I return  to my computer.


[08-Mar-19 09:23 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Double check the instructions from git hub in the meantime.


[08-Mar-19 09:24 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@TonyL is there anything additional to know about set up with the bundles?


[08-Mar-19 09:43 PM] TonyL#3577
@Cryptofist it's on github in releases page: just unzip, start daemon with rogue params, start tui


[08-Mar-19 09:44 PM] TonyL#3577
Tui will copy config, will ensure that rogue synced and set pubkey so unzip and start is all what is needed


[08-Mar-19 09:44 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@Sdunbar ^


[08-Mar-19 09:45 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Thanks  @TonyL  !


[08-Mar-19 10:03 PM] TonyL#3577
Daemon is `komodod`, tui is `rogue_tui`

Please help, human!
if you launch with -maxreorg=2701 it might be able to resolve this automaticallyError: A block chain reorganization has been detected that would roll back 2691 blocks! This is larger than the maximum of 99 blocks, and so the node is shutting down for your safety.

For fresh warrior name will appear in warriors list after your warrior back - it's fine that rogue printing blank name on this stage
