1. What is the #DogeDEX? 
DogeDEX is a decentralized exchange for all Shibas. It works as a non-custodial wallet that allows you to store Dogecoins without ever giving up access to your private keys. Your keys, your coins!

R u ready for #DogeDEX? With DogeDEX, you can create multiple orders with the same amount of Doge. Whichever order is fulfilled first will cancel the rest. It's like a bone multiplier!

is the kmd coin needed to trade on dogedex? (for fees etc)


[20-Feb-21 04:29 AM] Cryptoon#3362
nope


[20-Feb-21 04:30 AM] Cryptoon#3362
in the future it is on the to-do list that you get a discount in trading fees when you pay the fees in kmd


[20-Feb-21 04:30 AM] Cryptoon#3362
but not an obligation, if you want you can make DOGE/ICX trades if there is a market/counterparty for that pair


[20-Feb-21 04:31 AM] br#7886
have you promoted this within the doge community yet? This seems really nice


[20-Feb-21 04:32 AM] br#7886
Also, has the doge team picked it up yet and re-promoted itsself?


[20-Feb-21 07:51 AM] PTYX#6840
Yup, check the e dogedex Twitter


[20-Feb-21 07:52 AM] PTYX#6840
Not yet promoting because it takes time to build trust. We are in direct communication with them and are going to collaborate longterm.


[20-Feb-21 03:08 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Just an idea maybe have a big video icon on the top that says earn free doge and click it and a talking dog guides you through what an atomic swap is


[20-Feb-21 03:08 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Powered by Komodo etc


[20-Feb-21 03:08 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Then after going through tutorial or video give small sum of doge


[20-Feb-21 03:10 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Or two doge the chad one and the little doge and ask if they’re experienced or beginners


[20-Feb-21 03:48 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Also will doge officially announce a partnership with Komodo? That would be cool


[20-Feb-21 03:48 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Or even having doge devs tweet elon

On cryptoFr slack, there is lola who is working on doge and other projects since a while. We went on the #dogecoin channel to put 🎉 🥂 when DOGE raised above 100 sat. I don't know if KMD Team is in contact with her. I don't know her but I can ping her on the slack if needed

Not likely in the short term. We have to build trust. They shouldn't promote a wallet without checking the code and also building trust with us.


[20-Feb-21 06:15 PM] PTYX#6840
We could find a way to encourage an install and claim doge like a faucet for newcomers.

give ridiculously cheap doge in exchange for rfox

I found a new attack vector to get to Elon. 

Lex Fridman has worked directly with Elon in the past, can't remember if it was SpaceX or Tesla but has talked about calling Elon on the phone to get stuff approved for whatever they were working on. He hosts a podcast with guests such as Elon Musk, Vitalik Buterin, Joe Rogan, Eric Weinstein, and other notable public figures and intellectuals. He's been a guest on Joe Rogan's podcast a number of times.

He just tweeted about all the projects that piqued his interest and asked for suggestions so I made a thread about Komodo and shilled DogeDex at the very end. Retweets would be appreciated.

right, but they mention stonks and fiat gateway but not additional crypto. just wondering if thats a separate agenda someone knows about or if its not a priority over stonks and gateway.


[08-Mar-21 07:26 PM] c2k#6034
would think the crypto community which this was built for (guessing?) would prefer to have the ability to trade and store other crypto first before having access to stonks.

Buying "stonks" (doge) and storing it is doge's biggest issue that dogedex solves


[08-Mar-21 07:27 PM] PTYX#6840
The success of the app will come from its simplicity to understand what it does. We will slowly introduce the users to atomic swaps and the more complex functions of the dex


[08-Mar-21 07:28 PM] PTYX#6840
That's also why we're not overtly promoting it as a Komodo product. If someone looks hard enough, they'll see its a Komodo product but the simpler it is to understand, the more users will jump onboard.


[08-Mar-21 07:29 PM] PTYX#6840
The good thing that's coming out of dogedex is that we're already talking to multiple projects about different variations of the dex.

Q1. What is difference between dogedex & atomicdex?
Q2. Do I need to install dogedex to attend a dogedex competition? or Is it okay with atomicdex to attend a competition?


[09-Mar-21 03:30 AM] PTYX#6840
You do need dogedex for the competition. Under the hood everything is the same though.


[09-Mar-21 03:31 AM] PTYX#6840
The reason you need dogedex to compete is because we're using the unique taker identifier to rank in the leaderboard. We can tell if a swap is initiated from a desktop, mobile, or dogedex mobile


[09-Mar-21 03:32 AM] PTYX#6840
I'm very happy with the results and more users on the dex means more feedback, more exposure for kmd, and eventually more volume.

I mean as users, we could fill the atomic dex books with doge pairs so new users can see how many other coins they can swap doge for.

I paid a friend 5kmd to install dogedex on ios. This was his first crypto and his mind was blown. Playing with dogedex melted the rest of his brain. It even took me a few seconds to figure out what did what. But there is still massive learning curve. I think maybe in a few weeks I'll try to explain it again but am still moping up melted brain from my floor.

Hi,

I use Atomicdex, Binance Dex and Ledger Live. From all 3 I can swap from one to another. So yesterday i swap ETH to dodgecoin.

The reason why i use different DEX is that one app supports a number of coins, while missing one to swap find on another dex.

Just a penny for mine though

[15-Mar-21 07:52 AM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
This question comes from a few new users that I got to install Dogedex. Can prices be listed in $? Instead of calculating .001 kmd to .000whatever Doge, can users just simply say, I want to trade $1.50 of kmd for $1.50 Doge? Or $1.50kmd for $1.75 doge ?


[15-Mar-21 07:55 AM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
Getting the dex towards more how normal people think can only increase usage. It's relatively easy to explain dogedex as a multi wallet, however trying to explain trading causes the eyes to roll back in the head and the new user to pass out

the easiest way at the moment would probably be using COINS/USDC pairs so the market is value in $ instead of KMD or BTC etc


[15-Mar-21 08:17 AM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
The realization was that these new users had never seen an order book before. And had never owned crypto. What's red orders? Whats the green orders? .000what? Translate to sell orders, buy orders, $value and maybe they understand it.   Things a focus group might catch.


[15-Mar-21 08:28 AM] lightspeed393#5403
Yea i hear what you're saying. I have conflicting opinions on making trades/swaps as seamless as possible. In a way, great lets have the average user making trades with no understanding besides I have x, I want y.... done. On the other hand I think people should DYOR for a few minutes and learn, Red orders are sells, green orders are buys, etc. Trading isn't something to be taken lightly, people should understand what they are really doing.

I and I'm sure many others here have had to experience that learning curve. I remember making my first exchange account and having to learn how to look at the orderbook and understand whats happening before spending money and risk making some dumb trading mistakes. And making dumb mistakes and learning from them.

Sorry if this is the wrong place to ask, but is dogedex a different dex from atomicdex?  Or to phrase a different way, am I missing out on trading opportunities if I continue to use atomicdex desktop without getting the dogedex app?


[15-Mar-21 09:05 AM] CHMEX#0686
Its a different GUI with different logos the backend and the orderbooks are the same

Cool.  One of the reasons I found atomixdex was that I wanted to get some doge.  Fiat onramp would have made it so much simpler.  This is an awesome project!


[15-Mar-21 09:11 AM] CHMEX#0686
Looking at the dogedex website there is a fiat onramp in progress or maybe already working. Once that works i m pretty sure it will also come to atomicdex

Hi guys-ive swapped my doge to kmd ystd and i cant seem to claim the rewards. Funny thing is on the dexstats komodo rewards page it shows my unclaimed rewards. How do i go about claiming it?


[20-Mar-21 08:49 AM] bazinganerd#8575
Clicking on the dogedex claim button just shows theres nth from the app and im kinda stuck.

txn fees on the komodo chain are minimal. usually it is 0.0001 KMD.

[22-Mar-21 12:52 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Its possible to add, but the projects need to pay to be listed on the dogedex i think


[22-Mar-21 12:53 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@PTYX can give the details


[22-Mar-21 02:24 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I'm pretty sure you're limited on the phone app. But if you download the desktop atomic dex. You can manually add your erc20's to the wallet

Are there orders in the orderbook? If not your order will turn into a maker order until it matches or it's canceled


[23-Mar-21 08:22 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@Crunch check for return / refund / claim button


[24-Mar-21 07:27 AM] c2k#6034
not sure if my order is in orderbook but on the "orders" tab under Exchange it shows active (1)


[24-Mar-21 07:28 AM] c2k#6034
i will cancel for now.


[24-Mar-21 07:29 AM] lightspeed393#5403
I think ptyx meant were you buying/sell from an existing order in the orderbook. It sounds like you just created a maker order


[24-Mar-21 07:30 AM] c2k#6034
ty


[24-Mar-21 07:31 AM] lightspeed393#5403
it probably says somewhere on that orders tab if it's a maker or taker order


[24-Mar-21 07:32 AM] lightspeed393#5403
maker orders are designed to stay there just waiting until someone else buy/sells from it. Taker orders happen right away because they're buying/selling from an existing maker order


[24-Mar-21 07:38 AM] c2k#6034
is there a tutorial or video somewhere. id like to starty using it (or at least playing around wth it) but i need to figure out how to read the orderbook of any pairs first

@c2k  Here are some links. Of Note, Dogedex uses the same liquidity pool as the desktop apps AtomicDex and Marmara. Marmara right now is geoblock free.  Also in the links is the mpm (money printing machine) this is an automated way to interact with the order books.

would be good if there were some market makers on dogedex to tighten the spreads and make it more enticing to use. evey time i look at a swap it says at least 3% away from CEX price

Stay tuned for our release on April 20th. This wouldn't be possible without @KomodoPlatform team and we want to thank them for funding and helping the launch of #DogeDEX p2p exchange. This might be the biggest software development effort for Dogecoin in years! #dogecoin #dogearmy

What is #DogeDEX? 
It's a decentralized exchange for Dogecoin. It works as a non-custodial wallet that allows you to store Dogecoins without ever giving up access to your private keys. Free #Dogecoin from centralized exchanges. Your keys, your coins!

i'm excited to see the simple swap that we discussed.


[18-Apr-21 01:23 PM] PTYX#6840
not so much for desktop but i know once we have it on mobile, atomic swap will be smoother and also we can compete with shapeshift or offer atomicdex to build similar services

Custom coin airdrop with swap only in that market @PTYX

Snapshot then limited time market, say 100k blocks of custom chain.

Because the number of file descriptor is limited on mobile

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_descriptor
File descriptor
In Unix and Unix-like computer operating systems, a file descriptor (FD, less frequently fildes) is a unique identifier (handle) for a file or other input/output resource, such as a pipe or network socket. 
File descriptors typically have non-negative integer values, with negative values being reserved to indicate "no value" or error conditions....

It's discouraged to use older version, since there is bug fixing - however CLI can be used for such trade atm, easy if combined with tooling from @webworker01 for example

place some orders and keep it running. AtomicDEX needs more users providing liquidity


[04-May-21 01:08 PM] robertsemporium#4299
are there liquidity pools on atomic dex?


[04-May-21 01:08 PM] lightspeed393#5403
no


[04-May-21 01:08 PM] robertsemporium#4299
i wonder why KMD hasn't created liquidity pools yet, they are badly needed


[04-May-21 01:08 PM] lightspeed393#5403
because atomicdex has been their focus


[04-May-21 01:09 PM] robertsemporium#4299
yes, the dex could be great, but with zero liquidity its useless. LP's should have been a day 1

there are some LP's, anyone is free to do it

a pool is not necessary to provide liquidity on atomicdex. it's just like a traditional CEX orderbook. users place maker orders, takers buy and sell from them


[04-May-21 01:11 PM] robertsemporium#4299
you mean provide liquidity by place limit orders right?


[04-May-21 01:11 PM] robertsemporium#4299
yah, we need pools


[04-May-21 01:11 PM] robertsemporium#4299
slippage is huge


[04-May-21 01:12 PM] lightspeed393#5403
because not enough people provide liquidity. people just need to act and place some competitive orders or run the mpm bot to do it automatically


[04-May-21 01:13 PM] robertsemporium#4299
thats too hard to do. Liquidity pools will fix everything


[04-May-21 01:13 PM] lightspeed393#5403
whatever you say, but placing orders is really basic


[04-May-21 01:14 PM] lightspeed393#5403
people make it out to be much more difficult than it is


[04-May-21 01:14 PM] robertsemporium#4299
the entire defi crypto world has decided it likes the LP model, why not give the market what it wants


[04-May-21 01:14 PM] robertsemporium#4299
besides one sided limit orders are a very different type of instrument than providing liquidity into a pool to collect fees


[04-May-21 01:15 PM] robertsemporium#4299
seems like KMD is behind the times by not providing LP's

Does this mean that Dogedex is currently full, ie: no new coins can be added? When do you expect that coins such as chips will be added?


[04-May-21 01:43 PM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987

saw many small DOGE swaps and thought i remind people of one important thing: txfee on DOGE chain is 1 DOGE and dust amount is also 1 DOGE (so in the worst case txfee will be 1.9999.... DOGE)
it makes absolutely no sense to swap 10 DOGE, you will pay 10-20% on txfees
guess i need to introduce min_volume for DOGE too, just like with BTC and ETH

@elonmusk We can use @KomodoPlatform's tech to recycle #Dogecoin's hashrate like we did for Litecoin and Bitcoin to secure more chains - making it more eco-friendly and useful. We also used Komodo's tech to build DogeDEX - the first decentralized p2p trading platform for Doge. Buidl!

[14-May-21 05:36 AM] PTYX#6840
In theory, as dogecoin becomes more expensive, more miners will mine it, more hashrate will be added, and eventually it will have the same energy consumption. So is he planning on turning doge into PoS?

It doesn't make any sense. There's also much better solutions like KMD, eth2.0, and even xrp are more efficient

if he is pump and dumping btc or doge

then he is making xx times what tesla is making from normal operations

and because unregulated markets he can do whatever he wants


[14-May-21 06:00 PM] lightspeed393#5403
perfectly said. I keep seeing so many people on twitter talking about how DOGE is so much more efficient than BTC. If DOGE was worth what BTC was worth, the hashrate would be the same. Simple economics.

[24-May-21 07:38 AM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
I am of the opinion that beyond a simple user interface, there needs to be something to keep people's attention, even reward them for dex uptime. And an easy way to reach those with liquidity by advertising or pointing out request for liquidity


[24-May-21 07:39 AM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
As in: I pay a small fee to blast my request via push to those signed up to this service. Those signed up also get a cut of that fee.


[24-May-21 07:41 AM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
And or, if this is not a good fit for Adex or Dogedex, then I will propose a new dex flavor called earndex where as these features are prioritized. And potentially community funded


[24-May-21 07:46 AM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987

are there any ETH or BTC markets on dogedex today? im looking on mobile and there is nothing which seems strange.

any issues with the platform or anything we should be aware of?


[18-Jun-21 01:02 PM] c2k#6034
nvm...update fixed it


[18-Jun-21 07:11 PM] jspook16#3059
go DOGEDEX!!!

over the past 2 days i tried multiple times to withdraw ETH and BTC to an exchange and each time it says invalid address. are there some issues going on with withdrawals or anytihng that would cause this?


[21-Jun-21 04:51 AM] gcharang#6833
see if the exchange supports mixed case addresses for ETH and legacy addresses for BTC


[21-Jun-21 04:52 AM] c2k#6034
tx for the quick reply @gcharang  ...its kucoin which is a major exchange.


[21-Jun-21 04:54 AM] c2k#6034
i would think it does support those addresses for ETH and BTC but if not what are my alternatives?

To list on dogedex, do I just perform a swap and submit a PR, like on AtomicDex? Or just do it on AtomicDex? I tried about a year ago to perform a Ycash swap but, wasn't knowledgeable enough, I'd like to try again.


[21-Jun-21 06:39 PM] gcharang#6833
do it on AtomicDEX and then, ping @PTYX

Thank you

is simple mode available yet?


[27-Jun-21 02:28 PM] BoBot-LunaMaxi#8821
I don't see it on the regular Adex


[27-Jun-21 02:28 PM] BoBot-LunaMaxi#8821
is it only on DogeDex?


[28-Jun-21 03:09 AM] Slyris#2880
@BoBot-LunaMaxi It's on all branded dex !


[28-Jun-21 03:09 AM] Slyris#2880
https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/actions you can search for `[branded dex]:`

Is there any news on a new beta version of DogeDEX on iOS being released?

@PTYX any word on this? ^


[14-Sep-21 04:18 PM] Exile13#4458
Still says expired on iphone


[14-Sep-21 04:45 PM] PTYX#6840
Yes, the new version is being worked on and a rebrand of the logo and name


[14-Sep-21 04:45 PM] PTYX#6840
We had an issue with the playstore thanks to some patent trolls. The dogedevs don't own the brand of Doge, so they can't give us permission to use the logo


[14-Sep-21 04:45 PM] PTYX#6840
it's a mess but we're working it out.


[14-Sep-21 07:06 PM] Exile13#4458
Ok thank you

CSW already owns it :troll:


[18-Sep-21 10:08 PM] 777even | AgoraNodes#2624
Can one provide liquidity to the DEX?


[19-Sep-21 06:01 AM] CHMEX#0686
Yes anyone can


[19-Sep-21 04:51 PM] 777even | AgoraNodes#2624
Nice

This is Kabosu. She just turned 16 years old. She’s a rescue Shiba Inu who changed the world with an impromptu photoshoot back in 2010. Her slightly raised eyebrows and crossed paws remain one the greatest reaction images of all time. 15/10 such legend much wow

is  BNB/DOGE pair trading working in dogeDEX?   I placed order selling BNB  for DOGE,  matching price and order size exactly as buyer yesterday, the order stuck there, not done on trades.  I kind of gave up yesterday, but wonder if that actually is working or not for BNB


[08-Jan-22 03:54 AM] cipi#4502
there is only one bid in BNB/DOGE orderbook and that has a min_volume of 0.01xxx BNB, so you need to sell at least that, else the orders will not match... if they don't match, your order should be turned to a maker orders and posted in the orderbook... can't see any other order though
