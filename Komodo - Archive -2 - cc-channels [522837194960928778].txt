@TonyL Sorry that I did not notify anybody, I found a bug in channels and fixed it and also changed channelsinfo to be JSON format, and moved list of channels to channellist!


[22-Dec-18 10:00 AM] TonyL#3577
@Mihailo Sure, no problem 👍  I've found it as soon as continued to work on ChannelsCC GUI 😃

@Mihailo I'm making a channel between nodes A and B. Then broadcasting  one `channelspayment` transaction but not mine it to reveal secret of this transaction.
After it I'm stopping daemon on node A, waiting for some time and then trying to generate channelspayment transaction on node B using a secret from channelsinfo for not mined payment but getting: ```invalid secret supplied
 {"result": "error", "error": "couldnt create channelspayment transaction"}```
Am I missing something?


[19-Jan-19 04:53 AM] jl777c#5810
that should work...


[19-Jan-19 04:53 AM] jl777c#5810
seems a bug!


[19-Jan-19 05:03 AM] TonyL#3577
I've ensured that node B see this transaction from node A in mempool, also ensured that node B see a secret in channelsinfo. Mining was disabled on both nodes (only nodes in chain).
After Node A stopping Node B still see this channelspayment in mempool

is there a different rpc for receiver to make a payment?

once in the local mempool, the external node going offline better not be able to affect your local mempool


[19-Jan-19 05:06 AM] TonyL#3577
There is only one RPC call for channel payment as I know
Seems I've missed at least one commit which has changes for channels.cpp, let me rebuild and check again

[21-Jan-19 01:47 AM] Mihailo#5902
@TonyL The problem is that you made node B see the payment in meme pool. You must create a payment on node A that is totaly disconnected from the network, then when you see the secret you stop node A, start node B and make a payment. If the payment from node A is in mempool on node B then it is a existing payment and you won't be able to make it again, it must be a new payment.


[21-Jan-19 01:49 AM] Mihailo#5902
The case when you see the payment in your mempool and see the secret is when the chain reorgs and the payment is gone. But you are trying to test it without chain reorg so you must make it that the payment does not exist in node B!


[21-Jan-19 01:50 AM] Mihailo#5902
For the channelclose, it hsould work. I had some fix regarding this I think. Let me check.

Disconnected node A from network (banned node B and ensured that both nodes A and B have connections: 0)
Then revealed secret by transaction initiation on node A (ensured that secret is not available for node B), then initiated `channelspayment` from node B and it's worked fine 👍

In test framework daemon just crashed with this error above after I connected node A back to the network.
Will try to collect better backtrace If it's repeatable on non-regtest chain


[21-Jan-19 11:49 AM] TonyL#3577
Seems my problem actual in the `regtest` mode only - in usual mode cant reproduce it so far.
 In `regtest` getting ```komodod: txmempool.cpp:619: void CTxMemPool::check(const CCoinsViewCache*) const: Assertion `coins && coins->IsAvailable(txin.prevout.n)' failed.
``` as soon as both nodes with different `channelspayment` transactions in mempool are online and I'm trying to generate a new block


[22-Jan-19 02:23 AM] Mihailo#5902
Well, this should be investigated... Did you try this witout regtest mode, and what happenes when both nodes are online?


[22-Jan-19 02:49 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes I've tried this without regtest mode - in such case payment succeed.
Transaction from node B (transaction which created with revealed secret as an argument) mine as actual and transaction from node A mempool (secret revealing transaction) disappear


[22-Jan-19 03:14 AM] Mihailo#5902
Ok, never tried this if it happens that both sender and receiver some how publish payment - what would happen.


[22-Jan-19 03:22 AM] TonyL#3577
Node A is offline and publish `channelspayment` transaction to mempool for secret revealing
Node B publishing transaction with `channelspayment` to mempool  with secret usage
And then I'm not generating any blocks on node B and put node A back online

BTW, I see that you had a big merge in FSM recently. I know I'm boring, but could you merge it with squash commit, so that we can track changes and read git log easier? 😉


[03-Mar-19 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
no idea how to do that


[03-Mar-19 11:23 AM] jl777c#5810
I just use a git GUI with basic functionality and whenever i do anything else, i totally mess things up and create a days worth of cleanup work


[03-Mar-19 11:24 AM] Mihailo#5902
just make a PR on your branch first (and choose squash and merge), you can do it all in github, and then you make PR on FSM with just one comit now. So basically you add one additional step when merging.


[03-Mar-19 11:25 AM] jl777c#5810
it did come from jl777


[03-Mar-19 11:26 AM] Mihailo#5902
Ok, then you can just do squash merge to FSM.

[03-Mar-19 11:27 AM] Mihailo#5902

[03-Mar-19 11:40 AM] jl777c#5810
so just squash and merge from jl777 into FSM?

Yep 😛


[03-Mar-19 11:40 AM] Mihailo#5902
I have another step because I don't have permission to push to your repo so I need to PR from my branch to FSM, and than FSM to your FSM.


[03-Mar-19 11:40 AM] Mihailo#5902
But you can do it in one step 😉

That merge I tink may have been mine aswell... I thaught that by just doing it in a single PR it had all changes in once place. Thanks for showing me this too. I will make sure to use it next time I need to push a large merge up.

For small (few commit merges) it is ok to not sqaush it, especially if they have reasonable commit message, but for a lot of small ones changing only few lines it is better to squash

ChannelsCC returns now two keys witt same values:
``` "myaddress": "RWPg8B91kfK5UtUN7z6s6TeV9cHSGtVY8D", "myAddress": 
"RWPg8B91kfK5UtUN7z6s6TeV9cHSGtVY8D"```
Hmm  TokenCC too

[06-Mar-19 04:39 AM] Mihailo#5902
is this from channelsaddres and tokensaddress rpcs?


[06-Mar-19 04:39 AM] Mihailo#5902
Because they all call the same function, so I think someone modified the function and maybe added some redundant data


[06-Mar-19 04:42 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, from these calls

[06-Mar-19 04:45 AM] Mihailo#5902

|CCbalance                   | (numeric) | the unspent amount in the ChannelsCCaddress

| myCCAddress(Channels)       | (string)  | taking the contract's EVAL code as a modifier, this is the CC address from the `pubkey` supplied as the argument  

@Mihailo can you tell me if these descriptions are correct? specifically  ``pubkey` supplied as the argument ` part in  myCCAddress(Channels)


[13-Mar-19 09:13 AM] gcharang#6833
Also
what are the descriptions for:
1) PubkeyCCaddress(Channels)
2) ChannelsCC1of2Address
3) ChannelsCC1of2TokensAddress


[13-Mar-19 09:28 AM] Mihailo#5902
myCCAddress(Channels) is just a duplicate of myCCaddress. I think it was removed recently.

1) is the CC address of the pubkey supplied in channelsaddress command
2) This is the channel address where funds are stored when channel is opened (if using coins)
3) This is the channel address where funds are stored when channel is opened (if using tokens)


[13-Mar-19 09:30 AM] Mihailo#5902
And the ChannlesNormalAddress is the global address of Channel CC, but regular address - not CC. Every CC has one global CC address and one global normal address, and many used them but in cas of channels as it is between two pubkeys the global address is not used.

myCCAddress is the CC address of the pubkey used to start the daemon correct? @Mihailo

It seems it is not removed. I will fix it


[13-Mar-19 10:51 PM] gcharang#6833
@Mihailo as I understand it, the pubkey supplied in the `channelsaddress` method should be a destination pubkey. If a user supplies the same pubkey that was used to start the daemon, then the keys 
 ChannelsCC1of2Address
 ChannelsCC1of2TokensAddress
will be meaningless right?


[14-Mar-19 02:48 AM] Mihailo#5902
Yes, you usually supply destination pubkey as the Channel address is made from 2 pubkeys so you need the other one. But you can supply any pubkey you want, you will get the 1of2 address between the pubkey used to start the daemon and the given pubkey


[14-Mar-19 03:03 AM] gcharang#6833
Thanks. 
What happens to the 1of2 addresses when the pubkey in the argument is same as the node's pubkey, can a channel be opened from a pubkey to itself ?


[14-Mar-19 03:16 AM] Mihailo#5902
I haven't tried but I think it can be used. Basically, CC address will be created from two same pubkeys, and only you will be able to spend it 😉 You can try it for fun 😛

never trusted that regtest would have the same exact behavior as a real chain

those errors probably aren't insignificant btw. Seems the daemon built transactions that did not pass consensus rules, it should really never do that

Yep, I've tested it on usual chain and it looks fine


[19-May-19 12:10 PM] Alright#0419
if it is your tests causing it, try to figure out which values do it, so we can prevent people from doing it via rpc

It's very normal RPC calls actually

Hi, Could `Channels` be considered the same as 0conf in terms of usage?


[19-Oct-19 02:01 AM] gcharang#6833
it is more like lightning without routing problems, but needs a similar commitment of funds towards a receiver

can be used as a replacement for 0conf


[19-Oct-19 02:03 AM] gcharang#6833
and there is no sending to a third person through a person you have a channel open with
there is only sender and receiver, there is no bidirectional flow of funds @CrisF


[19-Oct-19 02:05 AM] gcharang#6833
if you think you will pay your local restaurant 100 KMD in the next month, you can open a channel with them for that amount
after that txn is notarised, you can make payments of any value < 100 KMD to them, that can be considered final the instant the txn hits the mempool


[19-Oct-19 02:07 AM] gcharang#6833
the same channel can be closed and all the remaining coins recovered at any time, will take one notarisation for a channel close too

I'm actually looking for a 0conf kind of speed transaction to use with tokens.


[19-Oct-19 02:28 AM] gcharang#6833
I don't think 0conf exists for tokens rn
maybe channels can be updated to include tokens support, I'm not sure


[19-Oct-19 02:33 AM] CrisF#3405
Ok, thanks @gcharang !
I tested tokens for a very short time when it was first developed.  Amazed at the speed.
I'm not sure if `Channels` will suit the project that was asking, but will pass along info on it.
Not sure how many usecases there would be for 0conf speed tokens, but imagine that there would be some.

They are using 0conf on BCH at the moment.


[19-Oct-19 06:36 AM] CrisF#3405
Not sure if `channels` will work in the same way.


[19-Oct-19 06:38 AM] gcharang#6833
it isn't as straight forward as 0conf @CrisF 
but the usage will be quite similar
the only addition is pre allocation of funds towards a receiver, which will take the time of one notarisation

they will also get on chain orderbook and trade with a Smartchain


[19-Oct-19 06:39 AM] gcharang#6833
if they manage to integrate gateways, they can even trade real crypto for these points on chain


[19-Oct-19 06:41 AM] gcharang#6833
they can even make the base coin very scarce (no public mining) and allocate it to registered customers -- this will restrict the number of transactions a person can do

@Mihailo 
`channelspayment open_tx_id payment_amount (secret)`
how is the `secret` used ?


[19-Oct-19 08:45 AM] Mihailo#5902
Secret is used only when destination issues the payment to itself from the channel. The cases for that is that the payment reached mempool but for some reason haven't been mined and it is gone. So the destination can makenpayment tx and supply the secret from the initial payment.

@Mihailo @dimxy do you know how to fix all these related hangs? we are putting together a release candidate, so we need all such hangs fixed. hopefully you can find and fix in code

@Mihailo seems this is the similar problem with lock ?


[07-Nov-19 03:53 AM] jl777c#5810
i think all the recently changed rpc calls needs to be checked


[07-Nov-19 03:54 AM] jl777c#5810
the ones changes for nspv or otherwise


[07-Nov-19 04:08 AM] Mihailo#5902
Yes, I will fix them today


[07-Nov-19 05:54 AM] Mihailo#5902
@TonyL @jl777c @dimxy I made PR that should resolve all RPCs that have new locking mechanism and tehre should not be any blocking now.

@gcharang <https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-api/channels.html#channelspayment> I think the arguments tables of `channelspayment` & `channelsrefund` are not correct, it isn't up to date with <https://docs.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-api/channels.html#channelspayment>

Hi, Is there a plan to upgrade the VerusHash option for Komodo-Antara smart chains (ac_adaptivepow) from v1.0 to the current version 2.3 now used within Verus?


[29-Jan-20 04:39 AM] Mihailo#5902
I think better channel for this would be #dev-modules as all CC related discussions will be done there soon. I don't have any insight on aPoW updates so somebody else can answer this. Perhaps @jl777c


[29-Jan-20 07:50 AM] gcharang#6833
I just want to add that apow is completely different from the ability to choose different hashing algos. the one that can enable verushash is ac_algo

Are channels more or less usable or is more Dev needed? It seems like it’s an under the radar feature of KMD that potentially puts lightning to shame.


[02-Feb-20 07:56 PM] jl777c#5810
it requires setting up point to point channels. so it isnt a pay to centralized hub model


[02-Feb-20 07:56 PM] jl777c#5810
i am not aware of any issues with it


[03-Feb-20 04:17 AM] Mihailo#5902
It should be usable normally, but as it is not used in production so far, some bugs could happen and if you find it you should report here so we can fix it right away.


[09-Feb-20 07:35 AM] jl777c#5810
@Mihailo i want to use channels for low value things, is there a way we can specify in the channel open (or some other call), that 1 confirmation is all we need?


[09-Feb-20 07:37 AM] Mihailo#5902
I have made TESTMODE flags for those things. If you export cppflags DTESTMODE and compile komodo with it it will work like that. But we don't have a way to specify it in open or etc.


[09-Feb-20 07:38 AM] Mihailo#5902
If it is needed I can modify it.


[09-Feb-20 07:38 AM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c


[09-Feb-20 07:39 AM] TonyL#3577
DTESTMODE require 2 confirmations if I remember correct


[09-Feb-20 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, please add this as a runtime option so it will work with the mainstream daemons after it is updated


[09-Feb-20 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no need to wait for notarization for a $1 channel, maybe not even a single confirmation, so if possible even allow mempool appearance to be good enough. i understand that if it never confirms or gets reorged, it could be funds that are lost


[09-Feb-20 07:45 AM] Mihailo#5902
Ok, should we limit some amount of funds for which this could work. As for higher amounts we shouldn't allow without confirmations.


[09-Feb-20 07:46 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no way to determine the value of the coins...


[09-Feb-20 07:46 AM] jl777c#5810
just make it require a specific extra parameter, so if it is being passed in, the user is forfeiting confirmation or notarization protection


[09-Feb-20 07:47 AM] jl777c#5810
there is not much value in speed if we have to wait for notarization for a one off channel
