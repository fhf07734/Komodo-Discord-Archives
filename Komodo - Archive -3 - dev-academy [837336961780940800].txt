I'm also looking for technical people to help produce content for the open curriculum! We're looking to cover a variety of topics - from getting started as a blockchain developer to in-depth tutorials. If you're interested in contributing, please send me a message.

As part of the Komodo Developer Academy, I'm starting up the Junior Developer Program to find new talent. If you already have some knowledge in development and are interested in getting real-world dev experience in the blockchain space, send your resume to ca333@komodoplatform.com and jobs@komodoplatform.com with the subject line "Junior Developer Program".

@ca333  is the academy learn at your own pace?


[06-May-21 11:13 AM] dewlinedew#8713
Or is their some minimum time commitment?


[06-May-21 05:16 PM] sems#7713
are we gonna wait too long  on waitlist?


[07-May-21 02:22 PM] sems#7713
Guess, no one knows. lol


[08-May-21 04:47 AM] smkhound#7640
It's a busy period this time of year with KMD and the upcoming new NN season - I'd expect hings here to pick up pace after that.


[08-May-21 09:38 AM] Audo#5667
The junior dev program that ca333 runs is a full hands-on experience where you work directly with ca333 & others.

The Komodo Academy has many other components as well, and those are yet to be launched. The other aspects are more like 'learn at your own pace' just as @dewlinedew was thinking.

I‚Äôd like to join the program


[12-May-21 10:22 PM] Mylo#8306
I am also interested, possibly as a scrum master (I am cerified).


[12-May-21 10:24 PM] Mylo#8306
Doing c++ dev I am also interested to port some of my experiments to crypto conditions, but a self learn timeframe is better for my current workload.


[12-May-21 10:24 PM] Mylo#8306
Thanks


[17-May-21 10:25 AM] Biz#0842
I'd also be happy to help with developer academy in whatever ways I can do so


[28-May-21 06:08 AM] LostDreamer#4024
hey guys @Artakush told me that you've got open spots in the academy
I'm very interested in hearing more about this


[28-May-21 06:10 AM] Artakush#4285
I can tell this much about @LostDreamer . Creative senior dev, with round 20 y exp profesionally ü¶æ


[28-May-21 06:12 AM] LostDreamer#4024
(but probably most of those in the wrong field üòâ web development) mostly intermediate systems joining together different systems via API's

@here like to invite someone to lead a dev environment setup for c++ development with komodo so i can learn what i need to get started. happy to pay a bounty and that i can record it and put on yt.

[02-Jun-21 11:16 PM] Mylo#8306
or if there is already a zcash/bitcoin dev env best practice to get familiar with


[22-Sep-21 03:55 AM] cryptosammy#3587
@Mylo just to setup a dev environment then follow build the daemon by source, look at the flappybird gaming sdk tutorial and adex build from source. Havent touched a C++ file from KMD, so not much help there.


[22-Sep-21 05:33 AM] Mylo#8306
thanks.
 building from sources no probs.
i'm interested in IDE, debugger options.
i guess it's a matter of starting with regtest mode and tinkering.


[22-Sep-21 06:58 AM] cryptosammy#3587
@Mylo your IDE is all about taste. I like Visual Studio Code. I build using powershell but not that I know it, just using arrow up


[22-Sep-21 08:27 AM] Mylo#8306
i used visual studio for c++ 21 years ago and eclipse/netbeans in java for a few years.
both had nice debuggers and some profiling, which was useful for the env (multi-threaded networking)
thanks for the chat üëç  i'll have a look whats on yt for coin dev


[22-Sep-21 12:22 PM] Slyris#2880
You can just use CLion it's the best C++ ide out there


[22-Sep-21 05:09 PM] thekaiky#4398
Hello, how is everything?

I'm a tech student and I'm 15 years old, I'm creating a Zcash fork to study cryptocurrencies, would you know how I could generate the genesis hash?

Thanks for listening

You should try out Komodo Smartchains, far easier/better option in my opinion.
You can find everything you'd need to start, here: https://developers.komodoplatform.com/

[23-Sep-21 03:26 AM] thekaiky#4398
I didn't find anything about the genesis block = /


[23-Sep-21 03:52 AM] cryptosammy#3587
@thekaiky its the first mined block, so you need the 2nd host for it to be mined.


[23-Sep-21 04:35 AM] thekaiky#4398
but i want to generate a new block with equihash for my blockchain, do you know how i can do this?


[23-Sep-21 06:51 AM] Mylo#8306
ok it looks good. i use pycharm community here & there


[23-Sep-21 06:51 AM] Mylo#8306
thanks for suggestion mate üôè


[23-Sep-21 04:45 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
All you have to do is setup the chain and use the 'setgenerate true` command and you will create a 'genesis' block and start mining


[23-Sep-21 11:37 PM] thekaiky#4398
but then what do I do with the genesis block that is already configured in chainparams?


[23-Sep-21 11:41 PM] thekaiky#4398
assert(consensus.hashGenesisBlock == uint256S("0x027e3758c3a65b12aa1046462b486d0a63bfa1beae327897f56c5cfb7daaae71"));
        assert(genesis.hashMerkleRoot == uint256S("0x4a5e1e4baab89f3a32518a88c31bc87f618f76673e2cc77ab2127b7afdeda33b"));


[23-Sep-21 11:41 PM] thekaiky#4398
in this line


[24-Sep-21 02:14 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Please read the documentation, you don't have to edit any of that!


[24-Sep-21 02:14 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
You create your own independent blockchain without touching any of that. Simply run the commands


[24-Sep-21 04:03 AM] thekaiky#4398
can you give me the documentation link please?


[24-Sep-21 04:05 AM] thekaiky#4398
but then I'll create a token, let it go, thank you so much for your help


[24-Sep-21 08:00 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
all chains derived from the komodo source share the same GenesisBlock and MerkleRoot
this is what allows for both cross-chain interoperability and chain independence


[24-Sep-21 01:41 PM] thekaiky#4398
oh yeah, got it, but there's no problem?


[24-Sep-21 01:46 PM] thekaiky#4398
so how does komodo have the genesis block different from zcash? how was this block generated?


[24-Sep-21 05:08 PM] NutellaLicka#4241

I'm not sure sorry, maybe someone here knows


[24-Sep-21 11:11 PM] thekaiky#4398
ok, sorry for the inconvenience


[24-Sep-21 11:35 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
No inconvenience at all, I apologise I don't know!


[13-Jan-22 05:41 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
It's a genesis block from Bitcoin if I remember correctly


[13-Jan-22 05:41 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
James used genesis block info from Bitcoin which applies to kmd and all of it's smart chains
