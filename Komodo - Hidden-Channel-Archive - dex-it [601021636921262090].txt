The atomicDEX mobile beta program successfully launched on iOS and android and you can now join us in #🤝│dex-mobile - We want to celebrate this big release with the first part of a special DEX campaign. Post a fancy atomicDEX mobile photo of you or trading screenshot and we will randomly tip you some KMD out of a 777 KMD pot - use one from the below scenarios:

a) Tweet a photo of yourself with atomicDEX mobile running on your phone (showing your KMD QR code - or post the KMD address in a 2nd tweet-comment)  from a cool location 
b) Tweet a screenshot of a successful atomicDEX mobile RICK/MORTY swap and one with your KMD address QR code (from within atomicDEX mobile) - add some info ref. your experience to the tweet
c) Tweet a video of you using atomicDEX mobile (the coolest video gets on our official channels and blogs)

Please use hashtags #dex-it #atomicdex #DEX and tag us in the tweets (@komodoplatform) - share your tweets in the #💬┃general and #dex-it channels. Happy beta!

It is good to do the atomic swaps on the mobile, but i think we need a plan to pull in other communities. Should we get a list of top 20 that we can trade KMD with?


[17-Jul-19 05:14 AM] Malti#3948
@ca333  might be easier to pin this message as it doesn't jump you to another channel

@hyperDEX yes i agree - we need to pull in some other communities as that will increase the campaign participations.

i got a pinned message in KMD discord (that I didn't write myself tho..) so proud 😄

@ca333 lets start at least with pirate/kmd and verus kmd


[17-Jul-19 05:18 AM] SHossain#0007
PIRATE?


[17-Jul-19 05:18 AM] hyperDEX#6586
arrr/kmd


[17-Jul-19 05:19 AM] ca333#0333
pirate is not fully supported yet in the app - but coming in the near future


[17-Jul-19 05:20 AM] ca333#0333
however, maybe their community would still join such a campaign.


[17-Jul-19 05:20 AM] hyperDEX#6586

yes i mean to get people using it to trade instead of DP


[17-Jul-19 05:23 AM] SHossain#0007
if you want to involve community, yes a good idea


[17-Jul-19 05:23 AM] hyperDEX#6586
DP wallet is down so it is a good option and real users


[17-Jul-19 05:24 AM] Malti#3948
DGB has a huge and good community as well


[17-Jul-19 05:24 AM] Malti#3948
+ the coin is already active on atomicDEX


[17-Jul-19 05:24 AM] SHossain#0007
DGB didn't respond about providing liquidity on atomicDEX


[17-Jul-19 05:24 AM] Malti#3948
so we could contact their discord admins to setup a bounty?


[17-Jul-19 05:24 AM] Malti#3948
ah too bad


[17-Jul-19 05:25 AM] Malti#3948
maybe now with all the fuzz they will change their mind?


[17-Jul-19 05:25 AM] SHossain#0007
if they would provide liquidity to their users, it would have been good


[17-Jul-19 05:25 AM] SHossain#0007
i've tested a lot of DGB swaps with this app


[17-Jul-19 05:30 AM] Pumtchak#0362
cool idea, but restricted for private beta users for now... maybe better to wait for open beta for such contest imo

I was just telling some friends I did some 'funtrades' on AtomicDEX and honestly I don't see any reason for CEX anymore or why I should use it. And I'm not even super concerned (yet) about giving control etc.. the convenience of this just beats everything

We need a plan of attack, we can do swaps all day but we need to get people of reach to use it. VoskCoin would be a good start, maybe get @TS  (there are 2 TS btw) to do a explainer video

@SHossain lets get a BNB to KMD swap and tag CZ

Cant we add more coins? I think adding BNB and LTC should be a priority in the next release


[17-Jul-19 06:02 AM] SHossain#0007
please talk to @ca333 for adding new coins 😃


[17-Jul-19 06:02 AM] hyperDEX#6586
CZ can retweet us pretty easily (especially if we send him an email before hand ......and ask for that USDT pair :troll_cool: ) if we use BNB

@ca333  he doesnt answer my emails any more lol, he used to.

[17-Jul-19 06:16 AM] hyperDEX#6586
will come around


[17-Jul-19 06:27 AM] Malti#3948

I can login to *my* wallets
Trade from *my wallets*
accumulate KMD interest

all through faceID on my phone

[17-Jul-19 06:36 AM] SHossain#0007
Apple doesn't provide a USB C to Lightning cable with a £1000 phone. They prefer you to buy one for £18.


[17-Jul-19 06:36 AM] SHossain#0007
what a ripoff!


[17-Jul-19 06:36 AM] SHossain#0007
their strategy is, if users are able to spend £1000 for a phone they def can spend £18 extra for a cable


[17-Jul-19 06:37 AM] Malti#3948
i think it's fair to charge 999$ for a screen stand


[17-Jul-19 06:38 AM] Malti#3948
if a sucker is stupid enough to pay it, then they won


[17-Jul-19 06:38 AM] Malti#3948

Just executed a swap on #AtomicDEX for #Android, it only took 4 min to complete. 

Am I living in the #future?

This time I used KMD/RFOX atomic interchange, not with test coins, it took 15 minutes, and the perfect interchange was successful, it feels great.

[19-Jul-19 06:57 AM] FtrSaroth#2069

I'm still missing the 13.37 verus in my balance right now, it says swap is still ongoing 2/3


[19-Jul-19 07:01 AM] Mr. Rager#6247
Maybe your swap failed, because I was trying to swap KMD for DOGE at the same time? Just thinking out loud


[19-Jul-19 07:05 AM] FtrSaroth#2069
Since were on beta test can be, but in all my failed attemps was only trying with one attemp at the moment, but failed every time the same way, only went until 2/3

[21-Jul-19 12:15 AM] actionslacks#4072
how about we just airdrop a deflationary erc20 token like ethplode and call it dexit. we could set up the smart contract to burn the dexit token once the swap is made. an assetchain called ethrekt will be created and distributed one for one for each dexit token burned. ethrekt will be a vehicle to to fund gas fees for future eth/kmd swaps. eth put into the address of your dexit token address will help cover the cost of gas fees, you can get a percentage of the dexfee for these conversions only. I have no idea how the minutiae would work, just spitballing. https://airdrops.io/ethplode/

On the HyperDex I can't put sell order of 3.77 Rick to KMD. 3 Rick to KMD is fine, 3.7 Rick to KMD is also fine. But 3.77 it hits Internal Server Error. It has been blocked by CORS(Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).

Should I be using DEX for tax purposes ?

I don't really like giving CEX my personal info

Didn’t you mean to ask: Should I be using DEX for tax-evasion purposes?

🤦 

[29-Jul-19 09:31 AM] JimD#9272
Its not tax evasion, its being smart


[29-Jul-19 09:32 AM] actionslacks#4072
all tax questions should be answered by a professional. any accountants in here?


[29-Jul-19 09:32 AM] JimD#9272
I guess the question would be.  Can the IRS get their hands on DEX data to enable enforcement of their tax policies ?


[29-Jul-19 09:43 AM] JimD#9272
I will take the silence to mean the DEX is hooked directly into the IRS database

I wouldn't doubt that they could get your wallet balances now, especially if you use kyc exchanges for anything.. Whether or not they can track shit down from 3-4 years ago is another question.


[29-Jul-19 10:41 AM] JimD#9272
I think it would be wise to switch over to dex


[29-Jul-19 10:44 AM] JimD#9272
when I liquidate 50 BTC after less than a year and move it to my bank account they don't need to know anything accept what I tell them


[29-Jul-19 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
since atomicDEX doesnt KYC, as long as you dont link your dex address to other addresses, then there is no link to you. keeping it segregated is pretty hard especially if you need to convert to fiat. zaddr based swaps will help immensely with privacy, and PIRATE will be the most private haven for funds


[29-Jul-19 10:48 AM] JimD#9272
Would sending BTC to coinbase from a DEX count as linking it my dex address ?


[29-Jul-19 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[29-Jul-19 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
but if you had 2 dex addresses you could intervene a BTC <-> PIRATE and PIRATE <-> BTC swap


[29-Jul-19 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
the ending BTC address being a never used address. there wont be a direct way to correlate, but this requires a lot of other such swaps so simply detecting you are doing this wouldnt be easy
