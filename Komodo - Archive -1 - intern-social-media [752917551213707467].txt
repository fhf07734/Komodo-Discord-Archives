@thebaselinetest some of our interns are working on Komodo content that they will either

a) publish on their own account in their name as a community contributor – and you can recycle that content and use it to create a Twitter campaign.
b) submit that to you as an idea – and then you can choose to do with the content what you best deem fit.

@Delton is availble as a proofreader/editor for you guys.

Medium article covering general highlights of the latest UI update.  
Used the 777 meme in the pics.  
Can you twitterize this @thebaselinetest and let me know what day you're going to release, and then I'll drop it on reddit Komodo & Cryptocurrency subreddits same day.

I made a series of tweets to be released 1/2 days after the other. The idea i have is that they could be used by the Komodo twitter page, or alternatively  I can tweet them from my account and komodo twitter page can supports/retweets my tweets.
