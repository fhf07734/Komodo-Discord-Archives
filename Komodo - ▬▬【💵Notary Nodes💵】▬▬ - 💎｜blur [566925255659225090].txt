@dukeleto @jl777c About XMR forks and BLUR. I didn't have time yet to deep-in inside XMR, due election preparation tasks, but seems XMR forks is totally different from Bitcoin-based coins and it's will very hard and impressive work if we can get it compatible with Iguana. From KMD side seems all remains the same (mean, how the nota tx is created, signing process and others). But from XMR side, currently it looks for me as a "deep jungle" or "other planet". First, XMR uses  RingCT (Ring Confidential Transactions) protocol, instead of well-known bitcoin protocol. It means (for me) that i totally don't know how to construct, sign and verify tx in XMR-based coin network. But one thing i know (it's good), seems it's possible to create and sign multisig tx with - prepare_multisig, make_multisig, finalize_multisig daemon RPC's (but this is also, still "deep jungle", bcz i'm  quickly read about it, but didn't tried). Also, all bitcoin forks, including kmd and zcash is utxo based. And iguana work guessed work with utxos ... but in XMR seems things are different, if i'm don't wrong with it: "Monero doesn‚Äôt have an UTXO set (the whole blockchain is the TXO set)" ... so, for now, i'm totally confused how XMR work and how dPOW should work in XMR. Hope, it's only for now, and future learning will clear something for me.

there are two main issues:
1. how to store the notarization data (2 hashes and height)
2. how to create a transaction that all the nodes in the network can recognize as a notarization


[14-Apr-19 03:00 AM] jl777c#5810
in bitcoin protocol we put the notarization data in opreturn data


[14-Apr-19 03:01 AM] jl777c#5810
for the recognition, we have the participating notaries all sign the same transaction that has the notarization data. that allows all nodes to verify the signatures are from the valid pubkeys and then they can see if the notarization data matches what they already have locally


[14-Apr-19 03:03 AM] Biz#0842
ah, this solution is actually fairly easy.  just not very well known that this is possible.  We have pay-to-scripthash type transactions as well.   The issue that @dukeleto is running into is probably the result of PoW hashes only being included in block hashes implicitly.  However, that's somewhat irrelevant to the ability for notarization nodes to be able to recognize a specific transaction.. within each transaction that occurs, we have a "tx_extra" field which is publicly viewable from the blockchain and is the same field that pools use for pool nonce.


[14-Apr-19 03:04 AM] jl777c#5810
how many bytes is it?


[14-Apr-19 03:04 AM] Biz#0842
This field is specifically left open, and not verified for content by other nodes, for the purpose of adding functionalities like this.


[14-Apr-19 03:06 AM] Biz#0842
it is the remainder of each block, until the block is full.  I will have to check to get you a number for sure... how many do we need?


[14-Apr-19 03:06 AM] jl777c#5810
80 is enough for the notarization data


[14-Apr-19 03:06 AM] Biz#0842
96?


[14-Apr-19 03:06 AM] Biz#0842
yes there is plenty of room for that and then some.


[14-Apr-19 03:07 AM] jl777c#5810
but I was thinking that if it has enough space for 13 signatures, we can put the signatures from the notaries there too


[14-Apr-19 03:07 AM] jl777c#5810
then we dont need to figure out how to determine which notary signed which input


[14-Apr-19 03:08 AM] Biz#0842
hmmm may have to get creative there.  I would just add a specific op_code for ntz txns.  Leading byte of the data in each field of transaction extra are parsed, which signal to the node parsing them how to handle the data that follows, and a size of bytes is included when the size isn't implied by the opcode/type of data itself


[14-Apr-19 03:08 AM] jl777c#5810
what would be easiest to integrate would be to put the rawtxbytes of a normal bitcoin notarization in there. that way the notarizer can just use the existing code to validate it. we then need to have some way of getting this tx confirmed


[14-Apr-19 03:09 AM] jl777c#5810
a notarization tx is about 2kb


[14-Apr-19 03:10 AM] Biz#0842
can you provide an explorer link to the precise formatting and length that would be necessary to support?


[14-Apr-19 03:10 AM] Biz#0842
or just a raw tx i suppose would be more helpful


[14-Apr-19 03:11 AM] Biz#0842
I could include this data in a transaction extra, and test it on our explorer, so we can know right away.


[14-Apr-19 03:11 AM] Biz#0842
basically, if the length fits, it will work.


[14-Apr-19 03:13 AM] Biz#0842
and as I said, this field is technically in the extranonce of a transaction's metadata, it gets seen by every node that comes in contact with it, but is never verified for content.


[14-Apr-19 03:15 AM] Biz#0842
I am not sure what you mean by getting the tx confirmed, but we could take that data, hash it with sha256, and give it a specific opcode as well or something as well if the data size is too large

[14-Apr-19 03:19 AM] jl777c#5810
had to split it in two parts, that is from RFOX chain but the data size wont change by more than a few bytes (length of chain name)


[14-Apr-19 03:19 AM] Biz#0842
ok


[14-Apr-19 03:20 AM] jl777c#5810
bitcoin does not support a 13 of 64 multisig


[14-Apr-19 03:20 AM] jl777c#5810
so I made a standard transaction with 13 inputs and the daemon compares it against the 64 valid pubkeys


[14-Apr-19 03:20 AM] jl777c#5810
this achieves the 13of64 multisig in a much more compact rawtx


[14-Apr-19 03:21 AM] jl777c#5810
even without the signatures, just the redeemscript would have been 2kb

that is the most comprehensive documentation that exists, probably.


[14-Apr-19 03:24 AM] jl777c#5810
if it can support 13 of 64 multisig, that would be one way to skin this cat


[14-Apr-19 03:24 AM] Biz#0842
thanks @Decker


[14-Apr-19 03:24 AM] Biz#0842
I am pretty sure that it would be possible actually.


[14-Apr-19 03:25 AM] Biz#0842
AFAICT there is support for N/N, M/N, and N-1/N schemes


[14-Apr-19 03:25 AM] Decker#3767
i'm read that monero itself supports N / N and N-1 / N multisig ... to sign participants should exchange private view and public spend keys ...


[14-Apr-19 03:26 AM] Decker#3767
but, all of this is a still "deep jungle" for me ((


[14-Apr-19 03:26 AM] Biz#0842
I do not think exchanging private viewkeys is smart for security purposes


[14-Apr-19 03:26 AM] Biz#0842
they are deterministic from private spendkeys


[14-Apr-19 03:26 AM] jl777c#5810
encapsulating the entire normal raw tx feels the easiest way to get the notarization onchain


[14-Apr-19 03:26 AM] Biz#0842
i agree.


[14-Apr-19 03:27 AM] jl777c#5810
assuming that works


[14-Apr-19 03:27 AM] Biz#0842
let me give it a go


[14-Apr-19 03:27 AM] jl777c#5810
then the issue is who is posting these tx onchain


[14-Apr-19 03:27 AM] jl777c#5810
it really doesnt matter as the contents are signed


[14-Apr-19 03:27 AM] Biz#0842
just logistically, yes i understand


[14-Apr-19 03:27 AM] jl777c#5810
but unless we have a way to make sure it gets onchain just once, we end up with a veriblock spam situation or nobody posting


[14-Apr-19 03:28 AM] Biz#0842
yeah, that kind of spam is a big part of why i didn't feel their system was the one for us


[14-Apr-19 03:28 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe some sort of deterministically based order and the notaries monitor to make sure it goes out, so there might be a delay of a few blocks if one some of the 13 signers are not posting it


[14-Apr-19 03:28 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, that works. (notarizationheight % 13)


[14-Apr-19 03:29 AM] Biz#0842
that sounds doable


[14-Apr-19 03:29 AM] jl777c#5810
that is the notary that should post the tx


[14-Apr-19 03:29 AM] jl777c#5810
if he doesnt, then the next block the next in line does


[14-Apr-19 03:29 AM] jl777c#5810
and since they just signed the notarization, we should get 99.9% success on the first one


[14-Apr-19 03:29 AM] jl777c#5810
just an untimely shutdown would need to have the second in line


[14-Apr-19 03:30 AM] jl777c#5810
but we have all 13 monitoring to make sure it is sent


[14-Apr-19 03:30 AM] jl777c#5810
@Deleted User


[14-Apr-19 03:31 AM] Biz#0842
yes that sounds good as long as we have all 13 waiting in line as you say. I also dont think it would pose an issue if we had say 3/10 send it


[14-Apr-19 03:31 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont like 3x inefficiencies, actually i dont like 10% inefficiencies...


[14-Apr-19 03:32 AM] Biz#0842
I think maybe relying on a waiting queue that has a single point of failure could maybe cause problems, especially if latency is the only thing responsible... could end up with some nodes sending more than one anyway in that event though


[14-Apr-19 03:32 AM] Biz#0842
you are right. probably best the way you say


[14-Apr-19 03:32 AM] jl777c#5810
its simple and if the mempool is also there we can prevent duplicates


[14-Apr-19 03:33 AM] Biz#0842
sure.  with only 13 nodes sending the transaction, duplicates aren't a huge concern.


[14-Apr-19 03:33 AM] Biz#0842
let me get to embedding this data, and i'll be right back


[14-Apr-19 03:37 AM] jl777c#5810
@Decker I think this method will require the least changes in the notarizer. Basically pretend BLUR is a normal coin, get a notarized tx fully signed. then instead of sending it out, embed it in a tx in the extra data and set the first height to broadcast


[14-Apr-19 03:59 AM] Biz#0842
we can include up to 2 times the median block limit: which is  `Median block size limit: 292.97 kB`.. compiling now, and then i'll send a tester


[14-Apr-19 03:59 AM] Biz#0842
so it should work either way. but lets make sure


[14-Apr-19 04:04 AM] Biz#0842
I think our blockchain would run into issues economically with bloat, honestly, before we hit a limit


[14-Apr-19 04:05 AM] Biz#0842
But ring sigs are sizeable too


[14-Apr-19 04:21 AM] Biz#0842
So, yes it will work. All that would need done is the extra field would need  extended beyond the 255 bytes of padding currently allotted


[14-Apr-19 04:23 AM] Biz#0842
Or we could add a separate field within the extra with a different opcode.  we will be changing consensus rules already for DPoW, extending this field to include additional op codes, even one a specific one for one for each notary node would be trivial to implement. Currently, the field is limited to 255 bytes. But blocks have much more room


[14-Apr-19 04:30 AM] Biz#0842
The size of the a given field in an tx extra (not the whole extra) is limited by the ability to encode the number 255 into the bytes that follows the opcode


[14-Apr-19 04:32 AM] Biz#0842
So we include a field field with the notation of 0xFA and include ten of those, to achieve 2.5kb necessary in a block, or we could do 13 iterations of a smaller field etc.


[14-Apr-19 04:33 AM] Biz#0842
This is the same way that pubkeys are read from transactions currently

[14-Apr-19 05:22 AM] Biz#0842
this is an example of a transaction with some embedded data.  I made that one two days ago or so.  codes not cooperating with my larger static sizes currently, but i may just be messing up the count..  i'll pm decker so that we can figure out way to go about this.  embedding the whole thing at once will not work though, on second thought, due to the reason i cited above.  we'll need to do something more creative but I'll pm @Decker and we have a project board up at https://github.com/orgs/blur-network/projects/1 if you'd like access to post there, decker

I'm not really sure that i'll be a person who can help with all of this, during my lack of knowledge about XMR based coins. At this moment, i think i know nothing about tx structure in xmr, ringct and other things. but i will try to do my best and learn something new, anyway, i think i can help with other things. so, for now, i'm more "reader", than "person who can produce nice ideas or write code".

whoops. yeah i was really tired when I was doing the transaction extra stuff it appears.  i gave you guys the wrong tx hash. here is a real example of one with custom data.  The other one simply had a payment id

[14-Apr-19 10:20 PM] Biz#0842
@jl777c a 13/64 multisig scheme, with 13 signatures required to send a tx would work, yes?


[14-Apr-19 10:21 PM] Biz#0842
If so, monero does have this functionality, but our codebase needs upgraded to support.  If that route is the best, I'll start getting BLUR up to speed there.


[14-Apr-19 10:24 PM] Biz#0842
Sorry, just paged back up.  Seeing that you said that would be best.  I'll start getting things moving on that.


[14-Apr-19 11:00 PM] jl777c#5810
13/64 likely would be much bigger tx and would require all the nodes doing xmr style multisig, which I assume would be much more work than sending the embeded notarization. but if the update for msig is a safe thing to do, it seems a good idea as having two ways is more flexible

[15-Apr-19 09:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Mylo my take is that BLUR is on the leading edge of research inside the XMR community, and is now integrating bleeding edge tech from KMD world, which makes this a very exciting project, since it will be hard proof that DPoW is compatible with coins which are not Bitcoin forks

@phm87 CryptoNote Dynamic, which evolved from CryptoNote Adaptive, I believe. @Biz invented it, or borrowed from others and improved, not sure


[16-Apr-19 09:13 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright very interesting algorithms inherited from XNV (Nerva) coin which BLUR source forked from, basically there are things that prevent a pool from ever existing

things in the block header, I don't fully understand but @Biz could

[16-Apr-19 09:14 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's like many params in an algo constantly changing


[16-Apr-19 09:14 AM] dukeleto#7326
and you must be a full node to constantly know what you do include in your valid block

connect several miners to a single full node?


[16-Apr-19 09:16 AM] Alright#0419
what prevents that


[16-Apr-19 09:16 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright there are ways to prevent it, i think you should try to break it


[16-Apr-19 09:16 AM] dukeleto#7326

[17-Apr-19 12:48 AM] Biz#0842
@dukeleto pretty good synopsis. A couple things slightly off, but over all very good. 

1.) CryptoNote is a protocol. CryptoNight is the hashing algorithm. They are worth being separate, in my opinion. 
2.) Being fully transparent, nothing about our current algorithm *prevents* pooled mining, just as CryptoNight-adaptive did not. In the long run, that may prove an exercise in futility. Rather than trying to remain pool resistant, we‚Äôre going to look to incentivize solo mining and try to make pools illogical. 

Why resist what miners *want* when you can make them *want something else*? I think incentives are what drove us here in terms of spec mining hardware, and pools... and I believe only incentives, with some help from faction-based inclusion of all miners and hardware, can correct the course we‚Äôve been running off toward. 

Our algorithm in CN-Dynamicv2 makes use of the previous blocks hash, a current timestamp from the daemon being hashed on, and the block height to create variation on an both, an inter-block and intra-block basis.  Most notably the the PRNG afforded by the previous block‚Äôs hash contributes the largest portion of this variation. We take the first 6 characters from the hash in hex, interpret that as an integer, and use it as a necessary variable in the calculation for iterations that are used at various points within the CryptoNight algorithm. Using constants in that calculation that aren‚Äôt known at compile time is what makes our algorithm CPU-specific. 

The unique algorithm has the added bonus of making our current implementation non-compatible with current pooled software. That‚Äôs very far from saying it couldn‚Äôt be done. These things will always find a way if incentives are there. This is why we don‚Äôt want to play cat-and-mouse. Our job is to make the mouse faster, and give the cat a new activity as well üòâ

@Alright I‚Äôve been dying for a good audit/pen-test kind of thing. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll be able to find some fun stuff. I‚Äôve found a ton myself already, but this has been (for me and our community) in large part a case-study of Monero‚Äôs tech, as well as experimentation to see what‚Äôs possible through application-based learning.  I feel strongly that unless the tech is tested, it‚Äôs well... not worth much.


[17-Apr-19 12:51 AM] Biz#0842
Only way we find that out is by seeing what falls apart when things get pushed. I don‚Äôt view attacks on blockchains as much of a problem really. If things get fixed in the end, it‚Äôs a good thing.

**An update on the state of DPoW integrations for BLUR (06/04/2019):**

Hey all, just wanted to keep everyone over here in KMD world informed on the changes taking place with regard to DPoW.  

Porting all of the BTC-derived code is taking a while, but things are moving along smoothly... particularly as of late.  Things finally beginning to click between XMR-BTC, mentally speaking.

At the following repo you'll see some recent changes (not all have been pushed yet, as I am trying to keep that repository in a state that actually builds without treating warnings as errors): https://github.com/blur-network/dpow-blur

[05-Jun-19 12:09 AM] Biz#0842
**Among those changes that have been pushed are:**

- There is now a binary that builds with the set of blur-specific bins that is titled `blur-notary-server-rpc`.  This will become the binary that will create the notarization transactions on BLUR's chain, once  the data has been written to into a raw btc transaction. 
- That raw BTC data is going to be affixed to the 'extra' field of a BLUR transaction.  This subfield in the `tx_extra` will be prefixed by a leading byte of `0x05` which will be unique to notarization transactions.  I am going to attempt to keep that an authenticated field, meaning only NN secret keys will be able to create this type of transaction (ideally).
- Can't promise the authentication, since this field is not verified for content by any node (as far as consensus goes). But since we are making changes to consensus anyway, I figure its worth a shot (really just mitigates performance hit from verification happening too often). 
- If you wish to compile that repo on your own you can also use the JSON-RPC calls for `notarization_data`, `height_MoM`, and `calc_MoM` to make a call to each of those three methods on the daemon.  I'll be adding documentation for these later on. 
- The above RPC calls will eventually be populated with data from the komodo state files, iguana's methods for merkle tree calculations, and all that good stuff.
- The backbone of the RPC calls and the notarization server are built.  So, what's left is a matter of actually plugging these functions into the RPC calls and making sure they work properly once that's complete.

[11-Jun-19 06:04 PM] Biz#0842
@Mylo haha I think you will find things quite different from the GAME integrations.  I am physically plugging all of the functions into our existing interfaces.  So it will be very portable to XMR-based coins, but probably difficult to discern whats going on if you're using the BTC-specific integrations as a comaprison


[11-Jun-19 06:05 PM] Biz#0842
My point with that is -- no worries if it all seems very foreign. BTC seemed that way for me as well, until very recently. And even now it's murky at times

[16-Jul-19 04:26 PM] Biz#0842
**An update on the state of DPoW integrations:** @here

**1.) Notary Node  addresses & wallet building is underway. You can see the beginnings of the address work  here: (https://github.com/blur-network/dpow-blur/commit/1d4397c4da4b70eb3a66a911c4e3c78b1c138b53).**

Understanding how this will work with NN pubkeys, requires a little background on XMR addresses.  In monero's ecosystem, each wallet address consists of two separate keypairs (4 keys in total, 2 public, 2 private). These consist of a viewkey pair, and a spendkey pair.  If keys are truly independent (they are deterministic in XMR, but will *not* be for notary nodes), the private viewkey can be used by third parties to transparently view the transactions. This is possible without the viewer having any way to actually compromise the funds of the wallet in question.  

 jl777 and I spoke about about ways to employ the existing BTC pubkeys that notary nodes currently use, and avoid requiring submission of private keys of any kind... What we settled on was repurposing the current btc pubkeys as private viewkeys for  notary nodes on BLUR.  For the other keypair (spendkey), a new crypto library, built on Ed25519 and GIMLI permutations, called `libhydrogen` will be used to generate a high entropy secret spendkey.

This means that NN operators will only have  to provide their pubkey on startup of `blur-notary-server-rpc`, and a unique wallet address will then be generated.


[16-Jul-19 04:27 PM] Biz#0842
**2.) An extra parameter for dpowconfs has been added to the wallet, and notary wallets: (https://github.com/blur-network/dpow-blur/commit/38d8a482302a57479d1b4e174d6b74145171e6d7).**

**3.) All of the types, classes, etc necessary from bitcoin have been consolidated into the directory `external/bitcoin` (which compiles as a static library).**

 I've also added a couple helper functions in `src/common/hex_str.cpp` for conversions between the two codebases. Converting from BTC style `uint256` to cryptonote's `crypto::hash` is pretty simple this way, and we don't have to do any crazy type-punning.

**4.) Unique `ntz_txn` tags & fields in the extra have been added, and have preliminarily been given a buffer of 4kB or so.** (https://github.com/blur-network/dpow-blur/commit/f6deef44d41847c7e8125e40c606379cc325af27 & https://github.com/blur-network/dpow-blur/commit/6ade53a6548c983dae100ef24159548ba188c999)


[16-Jul-19 04:29 PM] Biz#0842
**5.) komodo-related DPoW functions have been built with main lines into `cryptonote::core` via the `komodo_core` class.**  This class has a constructor that initializes `m_core` and `m_p2p` as references to `cryptonote::core` and `node_server`.  These are the two handlers that dictate consensus, effectively.

 - Here, core will allow us to load in state files, checkpoints, etc.  There are already placeholder functions (without bodies) for this.  You'll find all of `komodo_core` located in `src/komodo/komodo_validation.cpp & .h`

In BLUR consensus decisions begin in `core` and `p2p` as far as network communication goes.  These decisions are then finalized in `src/cryptonote_core/blockchain.cpp` where they are added to the blockchain, or rejected based on verification & hard fork rules.

Hello @Biz, I think we already discussed way back in the blur discord channel. I am just expressing my interest in co-developing the dPoW implementation with you in a Cryptonote protocol project. Since my company is starting a new project, and it would really help if I implement dPoW beforehand since we are still new, and we are starting a small chain. Let me know your thoughts. This is buggy super halfway code.

@josephnicholas GMT+8 interesting


[02-Aug-19 05:50 AM] dukeleto#7326
@josephnicholas GMT+8 which CN codebase did you fork?


[02-Aug-19 06:11 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
@dukeleto I forked Monero codebase. I think somewhat the recent one, but I changed the signature scheme.


[02-Aug-19 06:13 AM] dukeleto#7326
Is there a BCT ANN?


[02-Aug-19 06:16 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Not yet, we are still very new, and I am just the one doing everything.. :)


[02-Aug-19 06:16 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
So I might do that later


[02-Aug-19 07:36 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
@dukeleto is it Mandatory to create a BCT ANN?


[02-Aug-19 11:42 AM] dukeleto#7326
@josephnicholas GMT+8 to be considered real by many people, yes


[02-Aug-19 11:42 AM] dukeleto#7326
do you have a mainnet?


[02-Aug-19 11:52 AM] phm87#7395
@josephnicholas GMT+8  about the BTC ANN, from my personal point of view, please do it ASAP (maybe one day before launch of mainet) : as a pool owner and as a miner, I prefer to see one announcement that a good crypto will be launched today rather than to see a ANN of a coin launched, mined by few then announced. It is not a premine in my eyes but it is close to it. nothing personal here, I'm talking about the profits that we can do when mining a coin and when we read BTC each day (I stopped and I stick to KMD discord to find gems)


[02-Aug-19 11:54 AM] phm87#7395
I was really sad when another pool launch a coin and that I don't find any announcement or repo.
In addition, the BTC ANN will give you some visitors and some SEO/PageRank juice that is free and legit. Later, the same BTC ANN can be edited to show updated websites, links and so on


[02-Aug-19 05:07 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
@phm87 thank yiu very much. I will creat this ovee the weekend.


[02-Aug-19 05:08 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
@dukeleto point taken, we dont have mainnet yet we are still starting so we just released a alpha code release, which is buggy and nobody is testing it. :(

[10-Dec-19 12:34 PM] Biz#0842
I‚Äôm discussing with jl777 later today.


[10-Dec-19 12:35 PM] Biz#0842
Can say with certainty that nothing that comes from @Morningstar is of any value though


[10-Dec-19 12:38 PM] Biz#0842
Sorry, I should read things more closely. The bottom line is that notarizing directly to BTC is safer. So once I discuss with jl777, I‚Äôll have better update. But we have people helping out on BLUR side now. Which means things will proceed. Without help, blur couldn‚Äôt proceed. That much has not changed. What has changed is that we now have help.


[10-Dec-19 12:40 PM] Biz#0842
Hope that‚Äôs somewhat helpful. Since DPoW technically shortcuts nakamoto consensus, it needs done properly


[10-Dec-19 12:41 PM] Biz#0842
To be clear, the @ComputerGenie post was me. The @phm87 post was not me


[10-Dec-19 12:42 PM] phm87#7395
Yeah sorry I copied wrong msg


[10-Dec-19 12:42 PM] Biz#0842
That‚Äôs okay. It‚Äôs been a confusing few days


[10-Dec-19 12:43 PM] Biz#0842
Can‚Äôt blame you there. I would have liked for the trajectory for decentralization to be smoother. But that timeline is a luxury we don‚Äôt have Im afraid


[10-Dec-19 12:43 PM] Biz#0842
Fortunately we have a great community that really stepped up


[10-Dec-19 01:04 PM] Morningstar#3399
You said in Blur discord that dpow won't happen with Komodo.
Sadly i can't post an image here.


[10-Dec-19 01:07 PM] Biz#0842
And as I said, I‚Äôm discussing that with jl777. I was told that BTC notarizations cost $10k/yr if  I recall correctly. That much is simply not true by my math


[10-Dec-19 01:07 PM] Biz#0842
So these things need discussed again


[10-Dec-19 01:08 PM] Biz#0842
If we can‚Äôt speak honestly we are just wasting each others‚Äô time


[10-Dec-19 01:08 PM] Biz#0842

[10-Dec-19 01:11 PM] Biz#0842
@Morningstar I don‚Äôt see where questioning anyone‚Äôs role is constructive however


[10-Dec-19 01:11 PM] Biz#0842

roughly 1 KMD/day/chain with 7 minsigs at freq 5

64bit mask


[11-Dec-19 11:30 AM] Alright#0419
could be redesigned, but have to consider number of connections between nodes


[11-Dec-19 11:31 AM] Alright#0419
64 is a massive amount of connections already, adding even 1 more adds *a lot* more

That was my feeling as well @jl777c


[11-Dec-19 11:40 AM] jl777c#5810
for a 13 signature notarization, we are paying about $10 each


[11-Dec-19 11:40 AM] Alright#0419
it's like $9-10 every 10 minutes


[11-Dec-19 11:40 AM] jl777c#5810
about 50 BTC per year


[11-Dec-19 11:40 AM] Alright#0419
not including server costs, man hours, etc


[11-Dec-19 11:41 AM] Biz#0842
Ah, well what‚Äôs the point of a notarization every 10 minutes?


[11-Dec-19 11:41 AM] Biz#0842
When a single block can take longer than that to confirm once?


[11-Dec-19 11:41 AM] jl777c#5810
limiting the time to conduct a 51% attack


[11-Dec-19 11:41 AM] jl777c#5810
on the non-notarized blocks


[11-Dec-19 11:41 AM] jl777c#5810
if you notarized once per day, the cost would be a lot lower, but you would go an entire day between notarizations


[11-Dec-19 11:41 AM] Biz#0842
I don‚Äôt see how a non-confirmed BTC tx should be used to prevent that


[11-Dec-19 11:42 AM] jl777c#5810
the non-notarized blocks are at risk


[11-Dec-19 11:42 AM] jl777c#5810
BTC blocks arrive on average once per 10 minutes


[11-Dec-19 11:42 AM] Biz#0842
Okay. So just design choices we aren‚Äôt seeing eye to eye on really


[11-Dec-19 11:44 AM] Biz#0842
I would think once per hour would be sufficient to prevent large rollbacks.


[11-Dec-19 11:44 AM] Biz#0842
Or maybe once per 30 minutes


[11-Dec-19 11:46 AM] jl777c#5810
then the cost is only $500 per day

right, but there seems to be a major logic flaw in the code that decided the fee and then rejects the fee for being too small

[01-Jan-20 07:54 PM] 9oklp#8901
The best Cryptonote implementation IMO is Zano (swapped from boolberry, PoS & PoW based) , lead dev is CryptoZoidberg, who was part of the original Bytecoin dev team, which Monero cloned, and founder of BBR. It's quite bizarre how Monero has the credibility while Zano has the CryptoNote equivalent of Satoshi at the helm, and flies completely under the radar.

If Blur can add dPoW it adds something Zano doesn't have.


[01-Jan-20 07:58 PM] 9oklp#8901
My understanding is scammers launched Bytecoin in secret and stealth mined, and tried to falsify the history of Bytecoin to get 80% of the coins before anyone else heard of cryptonote, afaik zoidberg was just a developer of the tech, and not part of the stealth mine scam.


[01-Jan-20 08:00 PM] 9oklp#8901
I assume he launched boolberry to run his own coin and distance himself from Bytecoin and Monero, and then later created Zano PoS hybrid cryptonote and let BBR holders opt in for a swap.


[01-Jan-20 08:02 PM] 9oklp#8901
Zoidberg is Russian afaik, and is focused purely on tech, (a bit like jl777), and so Zano remains very obscure, but definitely cutting edge, and far superior to Monero IMO

We don‚Äôt claim to be ‚Äúbetter than Monero‚Äù we‚Äôre innovating in different ways. However, our nodes are more secure to run. This is due to not having miniupnp, unbound, or ZeroMQ as dependencies. We‚Äôve removed all of them.

Thanks for reposting. Both of those issues persist. Have a feeling it‚Äôs related to dynamic loading, but still getting to the bottom of it


[08-Jan-20 04:02 AM] Biz#0842
Also, refactoring the libraries to not compile as plugins seems to fix some things. Still some problems due to historical `blocks` library always linking as dynamic/static in certain libs, but we‚Äôve stopped using that as a historical record. All nodes sync the whole blockchain in our network, without masking PoW hashes


[08-Jan-20 04:02 AM] Biz#0842
Monero might do well, to do the same.

it's not "opinion"

@ComputerGenie i agree with you.  I just think inclusion is a good thing.  being PC gets no one anywhere, but when coupled with depictions of violence, thats harmful.

You guys were accusing someone I know of doing something they didnt do.  I protested and got banned days after


[15-Jan-20 04:34 PM] Biz#0842
from code of conduct: 
```
Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Focus on solutions rather than problems (the  latter is inherent within the former).
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences, within reason.
- Accepting constructive criticism without adversarial confrontation.
- Focusing on what is best for the community, over the self.
- Acceptance of all other community members, their ideas, and their solutions.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, personal altercations without reasonable cause
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission (i.e. ‚ÄúDoxxing‚Äù)
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate or marginalizing
```

@ComputerGenie wasnt me so i cant answer that.


[15-Jan-20 04:42 PM] Fart Master#6647
You posted a screenshot


[15-Jan-20 04:42 PM] Fart Master#6647
You said screenshots are easily faked


[15-Jan-20 04:42 PM] Biz#0842
that's not a screenshot


[15-Jan-20 04:42 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
`wasnt me so i cant answer that.`
seems to be everyone's lame answer


[15-Jan-20 04:42 PM] Biz#0842
you can fire up the testnet


[15-Jan-20 04:42 PM] Fart Master#6647
You said my GPU miner screens weren't to be taken seriously because screenshots can be faked


[15-Jan-20 04:43 PM] Biz#0842
test the code for yourself


[15-Jan-20 04:43 PM] Fart Master#6647
So why should we believe what your screens say


[15-Jan-20 04:43 PM] Biz#0842
same reason I asked you to post source


[15-Jan-20 04:43 PM] Biz#0842
no faith in screenshots necessary with public source


[15-Jan-20 04:43 PM] Fart Master#6647
Show me a notarizing transaction on a blockchain


[15-Jan-20 04:44 PM] Biz#0842
they hang in pool until they have 13 signatures.  We aren't testing a complete process, just the signature additions


[15-Jan-20 04:44 PM] Biz#0842
once they have 13, they're converted to standard blur transaction


[15-Jan-20 04:44 PM] Fart Master#6647
And please answer my question re checkpoint enforcement. Where is the code that has blurd actually utilizing these checkpoints


[15-Jan-20 04:44 PM] Biz#0842
and yes, mempool is technically in DB and therefore `on the blockchain`


[15-Jan-20 04:44 PM] Fart Master#6647
So you have not yet even generated a full notarization tx?

the checkpoint enforcement code isnt complete yet


[15-Jan-20 04:45 PM] Fart Master#6647
No. The mempool is not "in DB"


[15-Jan-20 04:45 PM] Biz#0842
@Deleted User that's reasonable, i guess


[15-Jan-20 04:45 PM] Biz#0842
again, you aren't the one sending the depictions, so my problem isn't with you


[15-Jan-20 04:45 PM] Fart Master#6647
Mempool does not exist in the blockchain


[15-Jan-20 04:46 PM] Fart Master#6647
If you think that, then how are you qualified to carry out this work?


[15-Jan-20 04:46 PM] Biz#0842
blah blah pedantics


[15-Jan-20 04:46 PM] Biz#0842
who determines who is qualified to write code?


[15-Jan-20 04:46 PM] Biz#0842
AFAIK i'm the only one writing it, so that would make me qualified


[15-Jan-20 04:46 PM] Fart Master#6647
Misunderstanding how code works is not good for someone tasked with modifying that code


[15-Jan-20 04:46 PM] Biz#0842
i'm no expert. these are learning exercises. but they're working


[15-Jan-20 04:47 PM] Fart Master#6647
But they aren't, cause you haven't made a notarizing transaction yet


[15-Jan-20 04:47 PM] Fart Master#6647
Half works, is not works

would seem to imply you're wrong


[15-Jan-20 04:47 PM] Fart Master#6647
And please, explain how your nodes will use these checkpoints and where is the code for that


[15-Jan-20 04:48 PM] Biz#0842
as I understand it, there is a notarization DB kept on iguana-side


[15-Jan-20 04:48 PM] Biz#0842
that's not code i'm tasked with writing, however


[15-Jan-20 04:49 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
`as I understand it, there is a notarization DB kept on iguana-side`
no


[15-Jan-20 04:49 PM] Fart Master#6647
You are tasked with writing the code that determines how blurd will use these checkpoints. Or did you not consider this?


[15-Jan-20 04:49 PM] Fart Master#6647
Do you think you just add notarizing transactions and then they magically turn into checkpoints?


[15-Jan-20 04:50 PM] Biz#0842
Yes, there's code here: https://github.com/blur-network/dpow-blur/blob/dpow/src/cryptonote_core/blockchain.cpp#L1479-L1495

Fact is you have not yet created a valid notarizing transaction. Not even completed the first step of integrating dpow into the blur concensus mechanism


[15-Jan-20 04:50 PM] Biz#0842
there's also a separate core instanciation that takes place here: https://github.com/blur-network/dpow-blur/blob/dpow/src/cryptonote_core/komodo_notaries.cpp that handles all of this

requires us having access to a BTC raw tx, which gets written into `tx_extra` field


[15-Jan-20 04:52 PM] Fart Master#6647
You seem confused


[15-Jan-20 04:52 PM] Fart Master#6647
Which chain are you writing notarizing transactions to?


[15-Jan-20 04:52 PM] Biz#0842
you seem to not be grasping what i'm saying. its okay. you've put in no effort to understanding


[15-Jan-20 04:53 PM] Fart Master#6647
I have read your code. It is incomplete and doesn't work


[15-Jan-20 04:53 PM] Biz#0842
BLUR merkle root will be written into the `OP_RETURN` field of a btc tx.  once that takes place, it will be communicated back to BLUR notary nodes, who will begin the notarization process, upon checking that tx exists properly on BTC


[15-Jan-20 04:53 PM] Fart Master#6647
Doesn't have a notarizing transaction... Says everything is working fine...


[15-Jan-20 04:54 PM] Biz#0842
@Fart Master if you're interested in the finished mechanism, you'll have to wait a bit.  I test along the way


[15-Jan-20 04:54 PM] Fart Master#6647
Hahahaha.


[15-Jan-20 04:54 PM] Fart Master#6647
So your already 6 months past your own deadline. How much longer do we have to wait?


[15-Jan-20 04:55 PM] Biz#0842
Are you writing the code? It's been thousands of lines


[15-Jan-20 04:55 PM] Fart Master#6647
Yes. Thousands of lines copy and pasted


[15-Jan-20 04:55 PM] Biz#0842
haha, i challenge you to do a diff


[15-Jan-20 04:55 PM] Fart Master#6647
Komodo and Bitcoin headers you copy in don't count


[15-Jan-20 04:55 PM] Biz#0842
i've rewritten the whole dpow mechanism for blur specifics


[15-Jan-20 04:55 PM] Fart Master#6647
Probably explains why it doesn't work


[15-Jan-20 04:56 PM] Biz#0842
mhmm, you seem to be awfully focused on it for something so uninteresting


[15-Jan-20 04:56 PM] Biz#0842
some might say you're obsessed with BLUR even


[15-Jan-20 04:56 PM] Biz#0842
regardless, thanks for proving a GPU miner was possible


[15-Jan-20 04:57 PM] Fart Master#6647
You'd like to have someone interested in you. But the truth is you just say dumb shit all the time and it is funny to read


[15-Jan-20 04:57 PM] Biz#0842
such simply doesnt happen without obsession and a spiteful motive, it seems


[15-Jan-20 04:57 PM] Fart Master#6647
Yes. Making a GPU miner over a coffee is obsession in the worst way


[15-Jan-20 04:57 PM] Fart Master#6647
You've spent more time denying it than I spent making it


[15-Jan-20 04:57 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
OK, so a dumb question (maybe)....
If you're creating your own dPoW that isn't using Komodo's, why is any of this here?


[15-Jan-20 04:57 PM] Biz#0842
how they say.. *Whatever helps you sleep at night*


[15-Jan-20 04:57 PM] Fart Master#6647
It's that kind of thing I like to watch


[15-Jan-20 04:58 PM] Fart Master#6647
@ComputerGenie this is why I say he is confused


[15-Jan-20 04:58 PM] Biz#0842
@ComputerGenie I'd like to involve KMD, as written, requires 64 notary nodes


[15-Jan-20 04:58 PM] Fart Master#6647
He says conflicting things


[15-Jan-20 04:58 PM] Biz#0842
which correspond to your pubkeys


[15-Jan-20 04:58 PM] Fart Master#6647
Don't have 64 nodes of your own?


[15-Jan-20 04:59 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
you can use a config and use as many (of, literally, whomever) to make it work as you want/need


[15-Jan-20 04:59 PM] Fart Master#6647
Public keys are... Public


[15-Jan-20 04:59 PM] Biz#0842
checking that tx's made it to BTC is simply for security


[15-Jan-20 04:59 PM] Biz#0842
not to work around anyone or anything


[15-Jan-20 04:59 PM] Fart Master#6647
You can write 5 lines of code to check a BTC explorer for a transaction


[15-Jan-20 05:00 PM] Fart Master#6647
So confused


[15-Jan-20 05:00 PM] Biz#0842
correct.


[15-Jan-20 05:00 PM] Fart Master#6647
So  @ComputerGenie's question is legit. What does KMD have to do with any of this if you are writing your own implementation and bypassing KMD?


[15-Jan-20 05:00 PM] Jules#2911

[15-Jan-20 05:01 PM] Biz#0842
lol, I dont do alt accounts


[15-Jan-20 05:01 PM] Biz#0842
@ComputerGenie can you elaborate on what that's doing?


[15-Jan-20 05:01 PM] Jules#2911

[15-Jan-20 05:02 PM] Biz#0842
I don't plan on working around KMD, i'd like to work together


[15-Jan-20 05:03 PM] Jules#2911
speaking of alts isn't it time you stopped hidding behind your fake alt fart account and let us know who you really are?


[15-Jan-20 05:03 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
you can use a file like that to tell iguana what to do
and use a file like
<https://github.com/Alrighttt/2019NNtestnet/blob/master/iguana/m_notary_testnet>
to run it


[15-Jan-20 05:03 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
you can, literally, use any number of nodes
and literally any number of coins


[15-Jan-20 05:03 PM] Hooftly#1337
Whats your Real name Jules? Biz?  Why does Fart Master have to reveal his real name and why is he an Alt? im curious.  Is Computer Genie An Alt? What makes him different from Fart Master

@Hooftly @Fart Master if the peanut gallery could stfu, we're trying to have productive talk


[15-Jan-20 05:05 PM] Hooftly#1337
Can you speak english Jules?


[15-Jan-20 05:05 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
the optimal would be to make it BLUR->KMD and ensure that bit works and then let Komodo do KMD->BTC, since it's already set up
but you can always fork it and go your own way after you know it works for you


[15-Jan-20 05:06 PM] Jules#2911
@Hooftly can you?


[15-Jan-20 05:06 PM] Biz#0842
@ComputerGenie that was somewhat the plan.  Obviously, KMD is cheaper, so i'd just like to make sure that txs make it to BTC, once they're written to KMD


[15-Jan-20 05:06 PM] Fart Master#6647
What? You're recommending biz use KMD? If that was an option, why didn't he just do that in the first place?


[15-Jan-20 05:07 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
`so i'd just like to make sure that txs make it to BTC, once they're written to KMD`
if using iguana, assume that bit is a given or else everything we have in Komodo would already be a fail


[15-Jan-20 05:07 PM] Biz#0842
no use having multiple KMD notarizaations contained in a given single BTC tx, or the "security of BTC" doesn't hold up


[15-Jan-20 05:07 PM] Biz#0842
at that point, its just security of KMD


[15-Jan-20 05:07 PM] Biz#0842
So this is why i'm wanting to have blur nodes check that it made it to both


[15-Jan-20 05:08 PM] Fart Master#6647
@ComputerGenie I think biz is saying the kmd devs are idiots


[15-Jan-20 05:08 PM] Biz#0842
KMD chain would still be the notarizer by proxy


[15-Jan-20 05:08 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
`at that point, its just security of KMD`
That's the only part you need to work out for your chain, the KMD->BTC bit is an added layer that's independent and already functional


[15-Jan-20 05:08 PM] Jules#2911
might upset notary node owners


[15-Jan-20 05:09 PM] Jules#2911
seems some of them are bad apples anyhow


[15-Jan-20 05:09 PM] Biz#0842
I don't think us checking that it made it to BTC does anything to subvert that. its just an added verification on blur side


[15-Jan-20 05:09 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
`might upset notary node owners`
We're all elected and no one "owns" their position


[15-Jan-20 05:09 PM] Biz#0842
@Jules Careful. not my belief


[15-Jan-20 05:09 PM] Fart Master#6647
Isn't kmd itself dpow secured by BTC? So  @ComputerGenie is correct, you only need to worry about KMD


[15-Jan-20 05:09 PM] Jules#2911
didn't you almost get kicked off genie?


[15-Jan-20 05:10 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
no @Jules


[15-Jan-20 05:10 PM] Biz#0842
ideally, 64 notary nodes and 13 required signatures does well to minimize bad actors


[15-Jan-20 05:10 PM] Fart Master#6647

[15-Jan-20 05:11 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
`there was a vote in Pirate. unrelated to NNs

Also, FYI, I asked for that vote and it was voluntary on my behalf 
I was willing to step down, not a question of being kicked out

Yes, that‚Äôs very true


[15-Jan-20 05:12 PM] Biz#0842

[15-Jan-20 05:12 PM] Jules#2911
hmm yes the "tone"


[15-Jan-20 05:12 PM] ComputerGenie#7004

[15-Jan-20 05:23 PM] Fart Master#6647
@Jules you still didn't say my name


[15-Jan-20 05:36 PM] Fart Master#6647
Why do you keep insisting I am some alt account like you know I am someone else, but refuse to say who it is you think I am an alt of @Biz @Jules


[15-Jan-20 05:44 PM] Fart Master#6647

@Fart Master you have a terrible knitted jumper collection


[15-Jan-20 06:20 PM] Jules#2911
tell me do you get them from 1 person each christmas?


[15-Jan-20 06:20 PM] Jules#2911
they must really hate you


[15-Jan-20 07:33 PM] Fart Master#6647
Let's add  @Biz and  @Jules not even knowing who they think I am an alt of to the collection of things they know nothing about


[15-Jan-20 07:34 PM] Fart Master#6647

[15-Jan-20 07:39 PM] Fart Master#6647
You're the one saying I'm an alt account of someone else, but then can't even explain who it is you think I am. You never seem capable of actually explaining what you think is happening. To call that an intellectual inferiority is a statement of fact, irrelevant of any other person's supposed intellectual superiority


[15-Jan-20 07:40 PM] Fart Master#6647
You say things, but can't explain them. That makes you stupid.


[15-Jan-20 07:41 PM] Fart Master#6647
And I'm not even asking you to explain anything technical. Just tell me and everyone else who it is you believe I am of I am not me.


[15-Jan-20 07:43 PM] Fart Master#6647

update on DPoW:

Added a new genesis transaction to blur testnet and dpow testnet. This should prevent network interference from across nettypes (has been doing so, so far)

also, regenerated all existing wallets for the new testnet (was a bit of a bitch to do)

those new wallets are available here: https://github.com/blur-network/dpow-blur/releases/tag/test-wallets but they are not yet funded

same pubkeys, but had to regenerate due to genesis tx change

Also got 5 more vps instances spinning.  so I'll probably get these funded and get 1 test round in with 16 mock notary nodes, before bed... I expect the sync issues to not make a difference given a couple extra nodes for error tolerance

only if we get down to 13-15 that I foresee any issue arising

The network id prevents interference from other nettypes. As does running nodes on different ports. Changing the Genesis tx isn't going to do anything. What even makes you think there is "interference"


[17-Jan-20 05:39 AM] Hooftly#1337
lol


[17-Jan-20 12:18 PM] Biz#0842
Run the old testnet code and you‚Äòll see. Nettype checking doesn‚Äôt work as it should. Appears all I had to do was change port handling, and the checks don‚Äôt work... go figure.


[17-Jan-20 12:19 PM] Biz#0842
Suspect this was why Loki had to add a testnet genesis tx too. Seems you don‚Äôt know protocol code very well


[17-Jan-20 12:24 PM] Biz#0842
As I‚Äôve said before, I‚Äôm much less concerned with how code *reads*, than how it *works*

Beauty of open source is that you can go back in commit history and verify this for yourself üôÇ

I do doubt you will actually do that though, as you seem to be intent on spewing misinformation


[17-Jan-20 01:25 PM] Fart Master#6647
Change the port handling? I know how the code works very well actually. Explain what changing port handling means, cause it looks like you're just doing something wrong... Again


[17-Jan-20 01:26 PM] Fart Master#6647
Do you even know where the net id is checked? Do you know what purpose it serves? Seems not


[17-Jan-20 01:27 PM] Fart Master#6647
You like to think I "spew misinformation" but all I do is correct you. You only see what I say as misinformation because it is the opposite of what you believe. But guess what, you are just incorrect. So what I am doing is correcting your misinformation.


[17-Jan-20 01:29 PM] Fart Master#6647
You say yourself you are regularly wrong, but refuse to listen to anyone that provides you with the correct information. That is a sign of a poor character. You are not interested in learning, just in preaching what you believe to people less knowledgeable in the hope they will listen to you


[17-Jan-20 01:30 PM] Fart Master#6647
And brand anyone who corrects your ridiculous comments as being hostile or unproductive


[17-Jan-20 01:40 PM] Fart Master#6647
Also... Just checked your code. You did not actually change the Genesis tx and you aren't using the different nonce. So your proposed fix doesn't actually do anything. Lmao


[17-Jan-20 01:41 PM] Fart Master#6647
I swear your just taking people for a ride right now. Nice trolling


[17-Jan-20 01:41 PM] Fart Master#6647
Fixes a problem with some code that doesn't change anything. Nice.


[17-Jan-20 02:06 PM] Biz#0842
The genesis Tx is indeed different. It loads on daemon init. You‚Äôre right that the genesis nonce isn‚Äôt being used though.


[17-Jan-20 02:06 PM] Biz#0842
You should test code after you read it üôÇ


[17-Jan-20 02:07 PM] Biz#0842
As I said, I didn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd actually test anything. Business as usual


[17-Jan-20 02:28 PM] Morningstar#3399
i am sorry @Farl , i should not have said idiot so i will rephrase it.
Is @Jules  still mentally challenged?


[17-Jan-20 03:14 PM] Biz#0842
@Morningstar I feel as though that‚Äôs even more derogatory, somehow. You seem like real standup guys


[17-Jan-20 03:29 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
Having spoken to Jules, it seems like a fair question to me ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


[17-Jan-20 06:53 PM] Fart Master#6647
Hahaha.


[17-Jan-20 06:55 PM] Fart Master#6647
Lol. "Your right, my code doesn't do anything, shame on you for not testing the changes..."
Classic biz. Still didn't answer my question. What is this "port handling" you have changed?


[17-Jan-20 06:56 PM] Fart Master#6647
Besides, why would I want to test code that doesn't work. You still haven't created a notary transaction. What do you want me to do. Run it, fail and then come and confirm for you that your code is broken?


[17-Jan-20 06:57 PM] Fart Master#6647
And you also still didn't demonstrate to me that you know what the network id is and what it does and how it is used


[17-Jan-20 06:59 PM] Fart Master#6647
And I also want to know if Jules is mentally challenged. His avatar is a Sesame Street character that counts really slow. Seems legit


[17-Jan-20 07:00 PM] Fart Master#6647
@Biz


[17-Jan-20 07:00 PM] Fart Master#6647
@Jules are you mentally challenged?


[17-Jan-20 07:00 PM] Fart Master#6647
Or are those words too big and that is why you don't answer??


[18-Jan-20 03:33 AM] Jules#2911

just out of curiosity, who do you hate more out of me and biz?


[18-Jan-20 01:52 PM] Fart Master#6647
I don't hate you. I feel sorry for you. Must suck to be mentally challenged. Having to live life not fully understanding what's happening. But not sure if you were talking to me seeing how 3 people asked you the same thing.


[18-Jan-20 04:43 PM] Jules#2911

[18-Jan-20 06:26 PM] Biz#0842
Lol it apparently does nothing in some contexts


[18-Jan-20 06:26 PM] Biz#0842
A lot of Cryptonote serves this purpose it seems


[18-Jan-20 06:26 PM] Biz#0842
`nothing` in some contexts


[18-Jan-20 06:27 PM] Biz#0842
I would guess those intricacies are what you intend to keep hidden


[18-Jan-20 06:27 PM] Biz#0842
But this bumbling bear is gonna stumble into all of it, and fix it where necessary.


[18-Jan-20 06:28 PM] Biz#0842

@Fart Master anyway i am calling you fugly from now on


[18-Jan-20 06:49 PM] Fart Master#6647
Lol. So in what context does it do nothing. That statement says to me that you know nothing of what it does


[18-Jan-20 06:49 PM] Fart Master#6647
And you talk about changing port handling to make your dpow testnet work. Can you please explain?


[18-Jan-20 06:50 PM] Fart Master#6647
@Jules didn't realise asking if you are mentally challenged was being salty. Does this mean @Morningstar and @ComputerGenie are also salty?

like your jumper collection


[18-Jan-20 06:54 PM] Fart Master#6647
Maybe I'm a concerned member of the crypto public. Concerned that we have a person with limited knowledge working on dpow


[18-Jan-20 06:54 PM] Jules#2911
concerned that is a loose word coming from you


[18-Jan-20 06:55 PM] Fart Master#6647
He can't explain how cryptonote works. He can't explain how the p2p network works. But we should just blindly assume he understands dpow and can implement it?


[18-Jan-20 06:55 PM] Jules#2911

you are like a broken record


[18-Jan-20 06:56 PM] Fart Master#6647
Yes. So just explain how it works and I'll go away


[18-Jan-20 06:57 PM] Jules#2911
you are boring like your jumper collection


[18-Jan-20 06:57 PM] Fart Master#6647
You keep refusing to explain how things work. Why? When it could make me go away. Just means you don't know what you are doing. Any of you


[18-Jan-20 06:57 PM] Jules#2911
you will never go away


[18-Jan-20 06:57 PM] Jules#2911
you will just find something else


[18-Jan-20 06:57 PM] Fart Master#6647
answer my questions and I will


[18-Jan-20 06:57 PM] Jules#2911
round and round we go

Is answering a question to find out really such a difficult thing?

yes


[18-Jan-20 06:59 PM] Jules#2911

[18-Jan-20 06:59 PM] Jules#2911
i think it is

[18-Jan-20 06:59 PM] Fart Master#6647
You boys are funny. All it takes is to answer a couple of questions with technical competency and you can't do it

Well you must not have scrolled back. Got @Biz and @Jules  talking about how much they like Sesame Street. It's a bit unreasonable to expect actual children to behave like adults


[19-Jan-20 01:56 PM] Fart Master#6647
So let's pose the question without "ad hominen attacks" @Biz can you explain the purpose and function of the network id in the Levin protocol and can you explain what you mean when so say you changed "port handling". Can you also explain who it is you think I may be if I am not the master of farts. You make repeated references to it being "my code" and "fake monikers". Surely you can tell everyone who you believe I am if not me


[19-Jan-20 01:56 PM] Fart Master#6647
Not difficult questions


[19-Jan-20 01:57 PM] Fart Master#6647
Answer the question and then I go away until I have another question, which I will then come back and ask repeatedly until I get an answer


[19-Jan-20 01:59 PM] mrlynch#5735
or you could ask in private


[19-Jan-20 02:00 PM] Fart Master#6647
Why does it need to be private?


[19-Jan-20 02:00 PM] mrlynch#5735
to spare the rest of us of this conversation


[19-Jan-20 02:01 PM] Fart Master#6647
Well it's a question about the technical underpinning of his network. Seems like a simple answer will suffice


[19-Jan-20 02:01 PM] mrlynch#5735
i've read the past few days worth of chat logs in here and there isn't much that could be classed as useful


[19-Jan-20 02:01 PM] mrlynch#5735
are you invested in BLUR?

check your DM, mind that steak hihi


[19-Jan-20 02:31 PM] Fart Master#6647
My investment is in determining if the developer is competent and the outcome of this dpow development. The inability to explain the simple mechanics of his coin suggest he isn't and the fact that dpow integration is 7 months behind schedule suggests it is probably a failed venture

Sounds subjective to me


[19-Jan-20 03:58 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
quite objective, really
> Crypto tokens represent a particular fungible and tradable asset or a utility that is often found on a blockchain.
so if it has no value, it cannot be that
> A cryptocurrency is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange that uses strong cryptography to secure financial transactions, control the creation of additional units, and verify the transfer of assets.
so if it has no value, it cannot be that
that whole pesky "words" thing ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


[19-Jan-20 04:31 PM] Fart Master#6647
I find it quite amusing. @Biz is willing to engage in these long arguments just to avoid answering simple questions about how his coin works. And as far as innovation goes. I see none. A broken half attempt at dpow? Not very innovative


[19-Jan-20 04:38 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
From your own "Project Roadmap":
> Expand outreach initiative to a larger number of exchanges
Why reach out to places that exist for the sole purpose of exchanging value if your widget doesn't have value?


[19-Jan-20 04:41 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
It's a rhetorical question and you can feel free to save the legalese for the IRS and just know that we know you know


[19-Jan-20 04:49 PM] Fart Master#6647
Yeah. Biz says different things out of different sides of his mouth. It's why I annoy him. Never know what new position he's gonna take or what new "exploit" he's gonna uncover. Always fun watching him flop around like a fish out of water and get slapped by the monero devs. But since @Biz thinks monero is my code, maybe it's the other alt of me that slaps him around


[19-Jan-20 04:53 PM] Fart Master#6647
But the overall point I am trying to make here  @ComputerGenie is how can we expect biz to implement dpow when he can't even explain the basics of how his coin works?


[19-Jan-20 04:55 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
Are you sure it's a coin? @Jules says it's a token and I guess I'm useless from this point on because I still cannot figure out what the parent chain of BLUR token is ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


[19-Jan-20 05:03 PM] Fart Master#6647
Well no. I'm not sure it's a coin, but that's what they've been calling it up until a couple of weeks ago. Up to the point that the exchange had all their coins burned and biz quit. Then when he came back (6 hours later) they started with this no value talk


[19-Jan-20 05:59 PM] Fart Master#6647
Another issue biz has refused to answer questions about I might add.


[19-Jan-20 08:07 PM] Biz#0842
I have absolutely no interest in engaging in these arguments. Value is subjective


[19-Jan-20 08:08 PM] Biz#0842
Blur is not a token. Blur is a coin.


[19-Jan-20 08:09 PM] Biz#0842
Any value attributed to those coins is at the discretion of free-market individuals, and their subjective view upon what our tech brings to the table. Supply and demand, of scarce virtual commodities, folks. Pretty simple


[19-Jan-20 08:15 PM] Fart Master#6647
There we have it  @ComputerGenie. Blur is a coin with value, but it is up to you how much it is worth. But that isn't what  @Biz has been saying... I thought the official position now was that it was some kind of experiment and not an investment vehicle. IDK. Seems like biz is having trouble understanding what he's even doing here


[19-Jan-20 08:18 PM] Fart Master#6647
And on scroll back I see you dismissing  @ComputerGenie as pedantic. If I remember right, that's what the monero devs said about you a couple of days ago. Does this mean you need to focus more on solutions rather than  pedantic non-solutions?


[19-Jan-20 08:28 PM] Biz#0842
Something having value or not, does not make anything an investment vehicle


[19-Jan-20 08:29 PM] Biz#0842
sounds like you need to study up on your micro and macroeconomics.


[19-Jan-20 08:30 PM] Biz#0842

No circles here. Just you repeatedly refusing to answer simple questions relating to the "coin" you develop

And you didn't disclose a vulnerability. Don't pretend you did


[19-Jan-20 08:32 PM] Biz#0842
I‚Äôm answering the questions. Your inability to understand is not my problem

Simple questions


[19-Jan-20 08:33 PM] Biz#0842

Bye bye now. Have fun twiddling your thumbs and obsessing


[19-Jan-20 08:34 PM] Fart Master#6647
Lol. So all you're doing is telling me you don't know what's happening


[19-Jan-20 08:34 PM] Fart Master#6647
See. Another refusal to answer a simple question


[19-Jan-20 08:35 PM] Biz#0842
You know. Your typing seems a lot like someone I know named angrywasp. He did the same thing with running in circles and diverting from things he‚Äôs outright wrong about

For the love of god, please stop wasting everyone‚Äôs time. And yes, that‚Äôs exactly the game you play


[19-Jan-20 08:36 PM] Fart Master#6647
Just admit you don't know so I can at least move on to the next question


[19-Jan-20 08:36 PM] Biz#0842
Keep diverting though, it shows your intent to manipulate very well


[19-Jan-20 08:37 PM] Fart Master#6647
You're doing it yourself biz. Would take less typing to answer the question, so your avoidance indicates a lack of understanding


[19-Jan-20 08:37 PM] Biz#0842
Jesus mate, it‚Äôs a UUID that should get compared on handshake


[19-Jan-20 08:38 PM] Fart Master#6647
Just admit you don't understand the underlying technology of your coin


[19-Jan-20 08:38 PM] Biz#0842
Lol, would be worse if I wasn‚Äôt learning and trying to confuse others. Speaks volumes on your motives


[19-Jan-20 08:39 PM] Biz#0842
I‚Äôve been entirely honest about my level of experience. The wall of disinformation is something I‚Äôm working on breaking down. I don‚Äôt view myself as a developer. Just a user who cares to learn for the rest of us. That walled garden of developer knowledge is exactly the problem in CryptoNote


[19-Jan-20 08:39 PM] Biz#0842
Those walls you are intent on misleading away from


[19-Jan-20 08:40 PM] Fart Master#6647
Yes. Cause expecting prospective coin developers to understand the code is unreasonable. Fool


[19-Jan-20 08:40 PM] Biz#0842
Lol, not many I see lining up to do work for Monero


[19-Jan-20 08:41 PM] Biz#0842
Fluffy and stoffu already left due to this shit probably


[19-Jan-20 08:41 PM] Fart Master#6647
And your response regarding the network id indicates you don't understand how it works, which was my suspicion. Thanks for clearing that up


[19-Jan-20 08:41 PM] Fart Master#6647
Monero has lots of contributors.


[19-Jan-20 08:41 PM] Biz#0842
And a quickly dwindling core team


[19-Jan-20 08:41 PM] Biz#0842
Some of your guys are perfectly reasonable. Selsta and SGP to name a couple


[19-Jan-20 08:42 PM] Biz#0842
Guys like you sour the bunch


[19-Jan-20 08:42 PM] Biz#0842
And drive away people who could genuinely contribute


[19-Jan-20 08:42 PM] Biz#0842
Anonimal seems like an alright guy too.


[19-Jan-20 08:42 PM] Fart Master#6647
Ooh. Well if we didn't have to deal with fools spamming the vulnerability reporting process, we'd get more done


[19-Jan-20 08:42 PM] Biz#0842
Oh, so you‚Äôre one of the VRP guys haha


[19-Jan-20 08:43 PM] Biz#0842
Thanks for that


[19-Jan-20 08:43 PM] Fart Master#6647
I am everywhere.


[19-Jan-20 08:44 PM] Biz#0842
You spend more time coming up with ledger bugs than fielding VRP disclosures


[19-Jan-20 08:44 PM] Fart Master#6647
And I see you trying to make a name for yourself by bashing monero, bit you fail every time to contribute positively


[19-Jan-20 08:44 PM] Biz#0842
I don‚Äôt bash Monero. I dislike a few guys you have on board


[19-Jan-20 08:44 PM] Biz#0842
And disagree with many of your decisions


[19-Jan-20 08:44 PM] Fart Master#6647
You can't identify a vulnerability


[19-Jan-20 08:44 PM] Fart Master#6647
You "feel" like there is one, but don't know


[19-Jan-20 08:45 PM] Fart Master#6647
So many feelings


[19-Jan-20 08:45 PM] Fart Master#6647
Little technical explanation


[19-Jan-20 08:45 PM] Biz#0842
Lol you‚Äôve had how many successful disclosures? For not having a doctorate in computer programming or any formal education... I‚Äôm doing pretty well üôÇ


[19-Jan-20 08:45 PM] Biz#0842
I know what I see. So do you. Otherwise code wouldn‚Äôt need merged to navigate around the issues I find


[19-Jan-20 08:45 PM] Fart Master#6647
So that is why I pester you with easy to answer questions. See how deep this hole in your knowledge actually is


[19-Jan-20 08:45 PM] Fart Master#6647
It is deep and wide


[19-Jan-20 08:46 PM] Biz#0842
How many unsuccessful disclosures have you had? Why not publish those? Guys like fireiceuk don‚Äôt even bother anymore because it‚Äôs so toxic@


[19-Jan-20 08:46 PM] Fart Master#6647
Yes. A pendantic dotting of is and crossing of ts. Very critical


[19-Jan-20 08:46 PM] Biz#0842
Haha, if you want to call it that


[19-Jan-20 08:46 PM] Fart Master#6647
Moo called it that


[19-Jan-20 08:47 PM] Fart Master#6647
I just agree


[19-Jan-20 08:47 PM] Biz#0842
Moo is a smart guy. But he doesn‚Äôt realize a lot of issues until after the fact


[19-Jan-20 08:47 PM] Biz#0842
Track record shows that


[19-Jan-20 08:47 PM] Fart Master#6647
Yes. Well that is why they ask you to describe the vulnerability you think exists. Something you fail to do every time


[19-Jan-20 08:48 PM] Fart Master#6647
Vulnerabilities are taken seriously when a person can identify and issue. Your latest pull request is more akin to giving a child a lollipop to make them quiet


[19-Jan-20 08:49 PM] Biz#0842
Lol, no, it‚Äôs more like me admitting that I haven‚Äôt fully looked into it


[19-Jan-20 08:49 PM] Fart Master#6647
Yes. If that is what you want to call it. I call it looking, but not seeing


[19-Jan-20 08:49 PM] Fart Master#6647
You look for issues, but can't find them.


[19-Jan-20 08:49 PM] Fart Master#6647
Other people can and get bounties for their effort.


[19-Jan-20 08:50 PM] Fart Master#6647
You cannot describe a vulnerability, so you are treated like a child


[19-Jan-20 08:50 PM] Biz#0842
But it‚Äôs okay, I can stop finding potential issues in your software, if you‚Äôd prefer I don‚Äôt follow your guidelines


[19-Jan-20 08:50 PM] Fart Master#6647
Imt actually surprised the guys still give you any air time at all


[19-Jan-20 08:50 PM] Biz#0842
I don‚Äôt go for bounties, so I can more easily publish the information, without proper disclosure channels, if you‚Äôd prefer


[19-Jan-20 08:51 PM] Fart Master#6647
Yes, do that. Idiot


[19-Jan-20 08:51 PM] Fart Master#6647
Just PR the next "vulnerability" you find


[19-Jan-20 08:51 PM] Biz#0842
I‚Äôll run it by anonimal and moo, since they‚Äôre the ones dealing with it in the first place


[19-Jan-20 08:52 PM] Biz#0842
If I were them, I‚Äôd definitely distance myself from you though. Just my two cents


[19-Jan-20 08:52 PM] Biz#0842
And hyc

@Biz I have come to understand that you are the dev of Blur project. If there are other Blur devs here let me know.

From what I gathered the purpose of this channel was dPoW intergration. Let's thus focus on talking about dPoW and how it can be integrated into Blur. In other words, technical topics. All other discussion is off topic and should not be allowed. I am sure Blur project got its own communication channels and other Blur project focused topics can be taken there.

I hope you are able to moderate this channel from now on @Biz as it seems like you are the channel owner. If there are further problems you can just tag @Community Moderator and we will help out.

In DPoW development news.... need a solution for better queueing of additional signatures. The way things are designed now, there is a partitioned section of the mempool where a multi-signature transaction gets signatures tacked onto it. The issue I‚Äôm running into is that mempool is not in consensus until those txs are included in a block. Mempool is not actually a central location, as it can vary from node to node


[20-Jan-20 12:02 PM] Biz#0842
Once those signatures hit a count of 13, the pending Ntz tx is converted to a standard tx (different verification context). So need to come up with a centralized mutex sort of thing


[20-Jan-20 12:02 PM] Biz#0842
Will be trying different relay message types to see if that improves the mempool determinism we‚Äôre encountering


[20-Jan-20 12:04 PM] Biz#0842
If anyone has any suggestions from KMD world, input is appreciated. This is a distributed computing problem, so general programming solutions are relevant. Not just blur specific


[20-Jan-20 12:07 PM] Biz#0842
As it stands, the mechanism works, but has a tough time if mempool splits at a given `sig count`, as it appears that it hampers connectivity once mempool states are different. Strangely, flushing the `ntzpool` appears to re-establish connections that split due to mempool state, immediately upon flushing ü§î


[20-Jan-20 12:08 PM] Biz#0842
Will be seeing if the relay messages from new block notifications solve the problem In the mean time, as getting more momentum behind the relay messages may help propagation


[20-Jan-20 12:09 PM] McLOLins#3309
imo, the key thing would be insuring that the txes are respected by the code as checkpoints
after that, then work on what mechanism to use for creating the txes


[20-Jan-20 12:11 PM] Biz#0842
That‚Äôs not a bad idea. Tacking consensus rules onto an incomplete transaction will limit flexibility though. Was designed this way so far, so that notarization tx creation can be done somewhat asynchronously... I.e. not having to restart the sequence if a new KMD/BTC notarization is seen mid-sequence


[20-Jan-20 12:12 PM] Biz#0842
That tx data gets embedded into a blur tx‚Äôs extra, which is a free-form field. So it is just a matter of removing and embedding  the new tx, when this takes place. This can be done with each signatures addition, as written


[20-Jan-20 12:13 PM] McLOLins#3309
will add more thoughts when the silly mute is over, I hate this PC

@McLOLins's raises a good point. Has any work been done to enforce the checkpoints yet?

i'm talking about Blur-side checkpointing
---


[21-Jan-20 04:41 PM] Biz#0842
successful test with `10 minsigs` though, for transaction creation.  So the hardest part is done, since we used none of Monero's existing multisig design... rewrote 10/64 from ground up nearly


[21-Jan-20 04:42 PM] Biz#0842
---
for some reason, issues only occur after `sig_count = 10`... so we are limiting minsigs to `10` for now, to get things moving.   If that limitation persists, size of the `signers_index` will be changed to account for the `10` sigs rather than `13`... So, checkpointing code, and some ntz-specific transaction relays are next.  Then, we'll be ready for some actual testing of the mechanism


[21-Jan-20 04:44 PM] Biz#0842
both of those have "stand-in" code, mostly commented out currently, so not all that much more to get done.


[21-Jan-20 05:02 PM] Fart Master#6647
Blur side checkpointing is optional


[21-Jan-20 05:07 PM] Fart Master#6647
And how do you fetch these checkpoints. That is the code I am interested in


[21-Jan-20 05:31 PM] Biz#0842
you should check `src/cryptonote_core/komodo_notaries.cpp`


[21-Jan-20 05:32 PM] Biz#0842
all of the SuperNet code is localized there, and `src/komodo/komodo_validation.cpp`


[21-Jan-20 05:32 PM] Biz#0842
there are also a couple lines in `blockchain.cpp`

[21-Jan-20 05:36 PM] Biz#0842
previously, all of the code was localized to `komodo_validation.cpp` but I ran into issues with cyclic deps and shared library builds.  So it was moved to `core` in a refactor 2 weeks ago


[21-Jan-20 05:36 PM] Biz#0842
you'll want to look at the `komodo_core` class.


[21-Jan-20 05:37 PM] Biz#0842
note that not all of that code is functional. but that will be the work for remainder of the week, since we had a successful test in terms of `ntz_txn` creation today.


[21-Jan-20 06:37 PM] Fart Master#6647
So I'm looking at this code and I don't see any code that fetches anything from any Komodo services. To the point that besides copying in some code with the word "Komodo" in it I see nothing tying the 2 coins together.


[21-Jan-20 08:24 PM] Biz#0842

We're talking about prospective development here.  if you wish to keep asking aimlessly step-by-step advancing questions, ask them of yourself.  You'll find something to make you feel complete there, maybe. Otherwise, the questions (without discussing solutions) are just trolling.  Go do so elsewhere.  I have asked you to do this many times. Continuing to do so won't be given a response, any longer

`In DPoW development news.... need a solution for better queueing of additional signatures.`

From the other day.  This is no longer necessary, for anyone interested.  Successful creation of a notarization tx with 10 signatures, has displaced this need.

[22-Jan-20 08:52 PM] jl777c#5810
it is possible to do a 51% attack in less time than half an hour, but there isnt a guarantee that all can be setup properly, alternate chain mined, etc. so having a definite 10 to 15 minute time limit makes doing the 51% have a big chance of zero gains. then there is the dpowconfs that makes it so that even if you succeed with the 51% of a non-notarized tx, it wont be credited as it wont have notarization. together it makes it so there is not a point to try to 51% attack a properly dPoW'ed chain

Ok. So now that we're past all this banning shenanigans, can we get back to the issue at hand. The size restriction on the tx metadata seems arbitrary. Is that a requirement of dpow of a self-imposed size restriction for some other reason? The question I really want to get to the root of though is why can't the size of the metadata be increased rather than decreasing the  number of notaries?


[23-Jan-20 01:58 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
BTC kept size small to dissuade "abuse" of "non-relevant" data 
other chains have raised and lowered the size


[23-Jan-20 01:59 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
The key thing to remember is that whatever size you opt for there is a possibility that __every__ tx can carry that weight and either you are or are not willing to accept that storage


[23-Jan-20 02:08 PM] Fart Master#6647
Right. I figured it was due to the size limit of the block metadata.

But then the bit I don't get is why it won't accept all the signatures. From what I understand of the code biz is creating a structure that contains the notary information and adding it to a pool to be collected later. He isn't actually trying to add a transaction to a chain.


[23-Jan-20 02:13 PM] Fart Master#6647
Because if he was, there would be a visible error in the logs that the metadata was too big and the transaction rejected


[23-Jan-20 02:14 PM] Fart Master#6647
So your theory makes sense, but I'm not seeing that biz is even up to a stage where the block size would become an issue


[23-Jan-20 02:17 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
I haven't actually looked at what he's doing, it's been that kinda week
imo, the optimal is a multisig tx that carries the specific data in the tx
the sigs being x of y would make it valid and the data would be then be nothing more than the state of the chain
a bit over-simplified, but that's essentially how the working model is now


[23-Jan-20 02:20 PM] Fart Master#6647
I find it hard to keep track when there are commits, reversions, more commits, moving code all over the place. It's all very messy and hard to follow development in logical steps. Of course it would help if biz could answer some questions. Might be able to work out the next move if someone could explain the state of the game as it stands

being the corresponding tx on the notarized chain


[23-Jan-20 02:24 PM] Fart Master#6647
Oof. I asked biz for an example tx on a chain a week ago. Would have thought all this testing would have yielded a tx on a chain somewhere.


[23-Jan-20 09:09 PM] Biz#0842
@Fart Master if you‚Äôre going to criticize development, contribute some code üôÇ


[23-Jan-20 09:10 PM] Biz#0842
The Tx meta I‚Äôm referring to is the database `txpool_meta_t` equivalent, but for notarization tx‚Äôs. They use the same size meta for DB values, but use up all of the padding in that struct (`ntz_pool_meta_t`). So, yes, size of the struct in bytes matters.


[23-Jan-20 09:11 PM] Biz#0842
`src/blockchain_db/blockchain_db.h`


[23-Jan-20 09:13 PM] Biz#0842
This is simply for ntz pool metadata. The transaction type used for the multi signature scheme is a `split_transfer`. Previous signatures are evaluated by storing previous signers `wallet2::pending_tx` struct as a binary blob. That is then added to database, when a pending notarization is added to pool.


[23-Jan-20 09:15 PM] Biz#0842
The prior signatures are evaluated using viewkeys from the hardcoded table  in `src/cryptonote_core/komodo_notaries.cpp`. 

pending_tx blobs are retrieved from DB by hash, according to that meta we talked about,  in pool (hash is stored here). Ptx blobs then get converted back  to structs, as well as checked against key derivations, in the `append_ntz_sig` RPC call function.  


This is located in `src/notary_server/komodo_notary_server.cpp`


[23-Jan-20 09:23 PM] Biz#0842
There is also a validation that checks signers index at each entry point to these transactions. 

This will tie into a `NOTIFY_NEW_NOTARIZATION` relay protocol message, which has already been forked off of the standard tx notification. Therefore, the transactions will process normally on network, once they clear that validation and get converted. 

The only permissioned part in this, is the actual notarization process (`pending_ntzpool`). Everything else is something a normal node could do.


[23-Jan-20 09:24 PM] Biz#0842
Think that answers all of the questions raised above. If I missed one, I trust you‚Äôll let me know


[23-Jan-20 09:33 PM] Biz#0842
But fart already knew all of the database bits.


[23-Jan-20 09:40 PM] Biz#0842
Oh, the `sig_count` stuff, from 13 to 10, right. It‚Äôs not a size limit, but an efficiency trade off. Due to the forked nodes that were occurring, 10 makes things a lot smoother. And from what I‚Äôm told, Genie is right that the 13/64 was chosen due to size limitations in BTC. This is not quite that, so much as a design choice for efficiency. If the troubles above 10 signatures magically stop, we‚Äôll increase to the optimal speed-security tradeoff.


[23-Jan-20 09:43 PM] Biz#0842
We‚Äôll just have to make some changes to those 192 bytes in Ntz pool meta, to compensate, if we increase signatures count. This multisig scheme isn‚Äôt bounded by composite keys, and doesn‚Äôt need predetermined. It‚Äôs a piece-wise signature addition, and squashing of destinations, using RingCT.


[23-Jan-20 09:43 PM] Biz#0842
This scheme wouldn‚Äôt work in the absence of zero-commitments.


[24-Jan-20 01:04 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`Genie is right that the 13/64 was chosen due to size limitations in BTC`
I was referring to the max size of opreturn, not minsigs


[24-Jan-20 01:13 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
as far as why 13 was picked, I never said because I don't think I ever knew


[24-Jan-20 02:33 AM] Fart Master#6647
@Biz I did contribute code. I made a GPU miner for your coin. As far as I am aware, I have contributed more to the blur code than any other person.


[24-Jan-20 02:38 AM] Fart Master#6647
But as to the number of nodes signing a tx. Why 13, why 10. The point I make here is that blur is a small cap coin with limited contributors. Fact is I am by all standards more a code contributor than Jules, 4ever of that Dan's legs dude. So I ask this. Is 10 even a number that is achievable right now?  Is there 10 people independent of you that can guarantee to run a notary node? If you can honestly say that you can't get that, then why not just 3 or 4. Still gets dpow integrated, but we can guarantee 3 or 4 independent people instead of 3 or 4 running 10 nodes which defeats the point of it


[24-Jan-20 02:40 AM] Fart Master#6647
Now I know you will think I'm attacking you here, but truthfully I'm not.


[24-Jan-20 02:42 AM] Fart Master#6647
No... Does deleting that message mean you won't notarize blur?


[24-Jan-20 02:43 AM] SHossain#0007
wrong channel


[24-Jan-20 02:43 AM] Fart Master#6647
Lol. Ok. My bad


[24-Jan-20 02:44 AM] Fart Master#6647
But it's a legit question of blur. Theoretically even though dpow is possible, does blur have the community support to run it?


[24-Jan-20 02:48 AM] Alright#0419
could probably get a dozen KMD community members easily


[24-Jan-20 02:49 AM] Alright#0419
I would guess we could get something like 15-20 people interested


[24-Jan-20 02:49 AM] Fart Master#6647
Sweet


[24-Jan-20 02:49 AM] Fart Master#6647
More than enough


[24-Jan-20 02:50 AM] Alright#0419
not a promise üòÖ


[24-Jan-20 02:50 AM] Alright#0419
a guess


[24-Jan-20 02:51 AM] Fart Master#6647
Well better than thinkig it's all hinging on a Sesame Street character. 
So @Biz do you have any code you need your smelliest code contributor to work on?


[24-Jan-20 02:51 AM] Alright#0419
wonder showzen -_-


[24-Jan-20 02:52 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`wonder showzen -_-`
are you even old enough to remember that far back? :troll_compadre:


[24-Jan-20 02:53 AM] Fart Master#6647
I know the code better than you. I could argue that, but I'll win and you know it. So just admit defeat and tell me what you're having trouble with and I'll see if I can make it work


[24-Jan-20 02:53 AM] Fart Master#6647
Or we can continue childish insults? Up to you really


[24-Jan-20 02:54 AM] Fart Master#6647
But just know I like childish insults as much as I like coding


[24-Jan-20 03:05 AM] Fart Master#6647
Better yet. Unban me from the blur server. Although I can't guarantee I'll stop trolling


[24-Jan-20 03:05 AM] Fart Master#6647
But better than expecting Jules to write code


[24-Jan-20 03:58 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Fart Master the number minsigs=13 is related to having 64 notary nodes and the sortition algorithm, it's not a random number pulled out of jl777's bunghole. The smallest number of servers I would recommend for a *production* DPoW network is 8 with minsigs=3 or 5


[24-Jan-20 03:59 AM] dukeleto#7326
that is what notary nodes use for their "testnets" when testing new dpow changes/etc


[24-Jan-20 04:01 AM] dukeleto#7326
having more nodes not only reduces centralization but safety against attacks


[24-Jan-20 04:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
With KMD prod NN network, half the network can be down/DoS'ed and you still have 32 nodes to fill in 13 slots (the same NN cannot fill slots continually, so you need more than 13 nodes up to have good dpow performance, otherwise the dpow lag (currenttip-notarizedheight) will increase


[24-Jan-20 04:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
With a network of 8, half the network upgrading at the same time and minsigs=5 means => no dpow


[24-Jan-20 04:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
with minsigs=3, you could have half the network down/upgrading and you would still have dpow


[24-Jan-20 04:03 AM] dukeleto#7326

_would compliment on how well that's written, except for the whole you blocking me thing_


[24-Jan-20 04:16 AM] Fart Master#6647
@dukeleto yeah I understand the more nodes the better. I also understand that your not expecting every single node to sign a notarizing tx. That's obvious. my main concern is whether blur can get the required number of notary nodes when there are only 2 people that even talk in the blur server.


[24-Jan-20 04:27 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Fart Master since all servers can be setup exactly the same, and automated via snapshots or docker/etc, it could be run by 1 or 2 people. Most likely, the BLUR community will want to find people with good sysadmin skills and pay them to notarize. KMD notaries get paid 75% of KMD block reward, BLUR currently has no mechanism to pay those who notarize and that does need to be figured out


[24-Jan-20 04:30 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`KMD notaries get paid 75% of KMD block reward,`
for clarity:
all KMD notaries combined receive about 75% of the sum total of block rewards


[24-Jan-20 04:30 AM] Fart Master#6647
Ok. So what I'm asking is this. Is there a point to 2 people running 10 nodes each as opposed to 2 people running 1 node each. That's my point. To me 3 nodes run by 3 different people is as useful as 3 people running 30 nodes. If decentralization is the aim, then we need more people, not just more nodes


[24-Jan-20 04:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Fart Master yes


[24-Jan-20 04:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
You are not understanding the math


[24-Jan-20 04:32 AM] dukeleto#7326
there must be at least 4 or 8 nodes, regardless of how many people run them, for the sortition algo to work at all


[24-Jan-20 04:32 AM] dukeleto#7326
and number of nodes must be a power of 2 as well


[24-Jan-20 04:33 AM] dukeleto#7326
there is the concern of centralization-by-humans (fair concern) and then can-this-work-at-all


[24-Jan-20 04:33 AM] jl777c#5810
the more people the better


[24-Jan-20 04:33 AM] jl777c#5810
doesnt have to be power of 2


[24-Jan-20 04:33 AM] jl777c#5810
code supporting more, even without the required people at least prepares for the day when there are the people


[24-Jan-20 04:34 AM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c ok, i should clarify "the current code assumes a power of 2" but that is not a core property of dpow, you are right (as usual)


[24-Jan-20 04:34 AM] jl777c#5810
but even if it is run by one person, there is value in having multiple nodes


[24-Jan-20 04:34 AM] Fart Master#6647
Yeah, but my question is more fundamental. Let's say biz spins up vps instances to give the required node count. How does that help? One person can collude with the nodes they control. So if 1 or 2 people control all the notaries, then how can we be confident in what they say


[24-Jan-20 04:34 AM] jl777c#5810
the reason is that the normal chain consensus can reach consensus across the nodes so that by the time the notarization is proposed, it matches what is already on peoples nodes.


[24-Jan-20 04:35 AM] jl777c#5810
i explained how it helps


[24-Jan-20 04:35 AM] jl777c#5810
the notarization is just a proposed checkpoint


[24-Jan-20 04:35 AM] jl777c#5810
if the notaries cant agree then it isnt even submitted


[24-Jan-20 04:35 AM] jl777c#5810
even if it is agreed, if a local node has different hash at the height, it ignores that notarization


[24-Jan-20 04:36 AM] jl777c#5810
so the notarization only reinforces the consensus that is already there, it does not force a checkpoint onto the network


[24-Jan-20 04:36 AM] jl777c#5810
even if someone is trying to control the notarizations, if the nodes dont agree with it, then it is ignored


[24-Jan-20 04:37 AM] jl777c#5810
of course it is better to have each notary node run by a different independent person


[24-Jan-20 04:37 AM] jl777c#5810
but multiple nodes scattered geographically is better than 2 nodes in a single data center, for obvious reasons


[24-Jan-20 04:39 AM] dukeleto#7326
in theory, one person can run 64 notary nodes all by themselves, and that is better than one person running just 4 or 8, but a whole lot more work. Every dpow network needs to balance how much work it wants to do (size of network) with ability to withstand attacks/internet outages/natural disasters/etc


[24-Jan-20 04:39 AM] Fart Master#6647
Yeah. I get that. Bit what I ask is this. If one person controls all the notary nodes and can collude between them, how does it help to run more nodes?


[24-Jan-20 04:39 AM] Fart Master#6647
As you say, more people, more nodes, betyer


[24-Jan-20 04:39 AM] Fart Master#6647
And I agree


[24-Jan-20 04:40 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Fart Master a fiber cut in one region or AWS DC down wont' bring down the dpow network, if there are more nodes in more places


[24-Jan-20 04:40 AM] Fart Master#6647
Bit one person running 1 node or 64 is the same is it not?


[24-Jan-20 04:41 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
if all of them are in one DC then it's not of as much value as in different locations
that's why Komodo has world regions


[24-Jan-20 04:41 AM] Fart Master#6647
My understanding is that 64 notaries are voted on to prevent collusion


[24-Jan-20 04:41 AM] jl777c#5810
did you read what i wrote?


[24-Jan-20 04:42 AM] jl777c#5810
do you understand that nodes in different parts of the world will have different network connectivity?


[24-Jan-20 04:42 AM] Fart Master#6647
Yes


[24-Jan-20 04:42 AM] Fart Master#6647
So ok


[24-Jan-20 04:42 AM] jl777c#5810
so you should be able to understand that a single node can go onto a fork much easier than 64 nodes, regardless of how many people manage them


[24-Jan-20 04:43 AM] jl777c#5810
no argument that more people is better


[24-Jan-20 04:43 AM] jl777c#5810
there should also be no argument that the more nodes that are in sync, the better


[24-Jan-20 04:43 AM] jl777c#5810
and notaries can collude to make a false notarization, but the network will reject it


[24-Jan-20 04:43 AM] jl777c#5810
like if you try to double spend, the network will reject it


[24-Jan-20 04:44 AM] Fart Master#6647
Ok. Hold on. I'm a slow typer


[24-Jan-20 04:44 AM] Fart Master#6647
So what you say is this


[24-Jan-20 04:44 AM] Fart Master#6647
Of all the notaries agree on a hash


[24-Jan-20 04:44 AM] Fart Master#6647
Bit that hash is different to the wider network


[24-Jan-20 04:44 AM] Fart Master#6647
Then the notarizing tx is rejected?


[24-Jan-20 04:45 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[24-Jan-20 04:45 AM] dukeleto#7326
This is a deep and important point


[24-Jan-20 04:45 AM] dukeleto#7326
It took me a very long time to understand


[24-Jan-20 04:45 AM] jl777c#5810
it is what makes it a decentralized checkpoint


[24-Jan-20 04:46 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
notaries are just record keepers ensuring that both chains carry the same record


[24-Jan-20 04:46 AM] Fart Master#6647
So for simplicity of argument. If biz runs 10 nodes that say 1 hash and I run 20 nodes that say a different hash, then the notarizations are rejected and my hash is the correct one?


[24-Jan-20 04:47 AM] dukeleto#7326
not quite


[24-Jan-20 04:47 AM] jl777c#5810
if the majority of notaries agree, then that is what is submitted to the network at large


[24-Jan-20 04:48 AM] jl777c#5810
so if you are running 20 and they all agree, the notarization will converge on that and it will submit that to the network


[24-Jan-20 04:48 AM] jl777c#5810
i assumed you meant 10 notaries and 20 notaries


[24-Jan-20 04:48 AM] jl777c#5810
if you mean 10 notaries and 20 non-notary nodes, then it is the same as there not being any notarization


[24-Jan-20 04:49 AM] Fart Master#6647
So I can still attack the network if I can overwhelm the notaries with a competing hash? So the point of dpow is not to be an ultimate source of truth, bit to make an attack more difficult?


[24-Jan-20 04:49 AM] dukeleto#7326
One big misunderstanding I see is people asking about "malicious" or "wrong" notarizations, by perhaps colluding notaries that want to attack the network. A notarization, if valid, must have correct Merkle tree data. Notaries cannot make "fake" notarization that aren't valid, the worst they can do is nothing at all @Fart Master


[24-Jan-20 04:49 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Fart Master dpow makes attacking the chain at least as hard as attacking BTC


[24-Jan-20 04:50 AM] dukeleto#7326
not just "a bit more difficult"


[24-Jan-20 04:50 AM] jl777c#5810
only the notaries determine amongst themselves what the proposed notarization is


[24-Jan-20 04:50 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure how you plan to overwhelm the notaries with a competing hash, unless you mean 51% attacking the network, in that case whatever the chain is that has reached consensus is the "real" chain and it will be notarized


[24-Jan-20 04:51 AM] jl777c#5810
once notarized, it cant be undone


[24-Jan-20 04:51 AM] jl777c#5810
so by waiting for a notarization, you can know what the final hash for that height is, regardless of who created that block


[24-Jan-20 04:52 AM] jl777c#5810
in practice, during a 51% attack, the network is forked and notary nodes cant reach consensus among themselves and no notarization is submitted


[24-Jan-20 04:52 AM] Fart Master#6647
Well that's what I mean. If I have for arguments sale 80% of the nethash then the blocks I produce are what gets notarized


[24-Jan-20 04:52 AM] jl777c#5810
so the lack of a notarization is  a very good indication that some network level event is happening


[24-Jan-20 04:52 AM] jl777c#5810
of course, dPoW notarizes the chain after it has reached consensus using its normal mechanism


[24-Jan-20 04:53 AM] jl777c#5810
it however does not allow 100% hashrate to overturn a block once it is notarized


[24-Jan-20 04:53 AM] Fart Master#6647
I see. So if the network is forked and no notarization happens it falls back to the last notarization which we assume was on a valid chain


[24-Jan-20 04:54 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
yes, the longest notarized chain is "the chain" just like as if it were a hardcoded checkpoint


[24-Jan-20 04:54 AM] jl777c#5810
by definition the longest notarized chain is the valid chain


[24-Jan-20 04:54 AM] Fart Master#6647
Ok

Awesome


[24-Jan-20 04:54 AM] jl777c#5810
so having a single person manage all the nodes isnt great from an opsec standpoint and allows them to stop notarizations at anytime


[24-Jan-20 04:55 AM] jl777c#5810
but it doesnt allow creation of a valid notarization from an invalid hash


[24-Jan-20 04:55 AM] Fart Master#6647
Yeah. That's my primary concern


[24-Jan-20 04:55 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems a graceful degradation, as the worst is that it reverts to not having the notarizations


[24-Jan-20 04:55 AM] Fart Master#6647
Blur is almost dead. It's going to come down to biz himself running all the notary nodes


[24-Jan-20 05:00 AM] dukeleto#7326
Those are 2 orthogonal ideas


[24-Jan-20 05:01 AM] dukeleto#7326
Blur price could be pamping, but still, Biz would have no Founders Reward to pay notary nodes to notarize BLUR. The price of BLUR does not solve anything, because there is no way to pay notaries, that I see currently. Figuring out a way to pay notaries sounds like what Blur needs to do


[24-Jan-20 05:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Fart Master "almost dead" doesn't mean anything in this industry, just look at ZCL+ BTCP üòâ


[24-Jan-20 05:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
miners will mine a "dead coin" for years, because "dead coins" pamp sometimes


[24-Jan-20 05:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
I see a lot more custom dev work going on in BLUR than most Zcash forks


[24-Jan-20 05:07 AM] Fart Master#6647
I look at community engagement, of which blur has none. Price means nothing.


[24-Jan-20 05:08 AM] Fart Master#6647
So whole I am interested in dpow as a technology, I am doubtful of blur being the vehicle that drives it forward.


[24-Jan-20 05:09 AM] Fart Master#6647
And it is a lack of community engagement that makes me think that. Hence all the questions about notary collusion


[24-Jan-20 05:10 AM] Fart Master#6647
Because I feel blur simply doesn't have the community backing required


[24-Jan-20 06:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Fart Master just a random idea, but an official "BLUR dpow donation" address could be made public, and the community can put some miners towards it, and that pool of funds could be used to pay dpow ops. This could work for any coin. Not perfect, but better than nothing. If the community doesn't value dpow enough to donate, then maybe it doesn't deserve it.


[24-Jan-20 06:07 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Fart Master you bring up a lot of valid points. Regardless of which CN coin puts dpow into prod first, most likely they will use some BLUR dpow code because Biz figured out so many low-level internals things to bridge stuff and documented it well


[24-Jan-20 06:19 AM] Fart Master#6647
Hmmm. I agree with the donation bit. Not the "biz done well" bit. I don't actually see what biz has done special here. Bit I am a critic. I have not seen a tx on a chain


[24-Jan-20 06:19 AM] Hooftly#1337
He needs to fix his tail emission first and foremost


[24-Jan-20 06:19 AM] Fart Master#6647
I have not seen a working tx at all


[24-Jan-20 06:19 AM] Hooftly#1337
his tail emission is 0.2 coins per block not 2 as advertised


[24-Jan-20 06:20 AM] Fart Master#6647
What I have seen is a custom structure which collects signatures from notaries. This is not special or CN specific


[24-Jan-20 09:01 AM] Biz#0842
@jl777c you mentioned that for doing this work, that you would support Blur notarizations, free of charge, for 3 years, at one point. Is that offer no longer on the table?


[24-Jan-20 09:03 AM] Biz#0842

[24-Jan-20 09:09 AM] Hooftly#1337
Still needs to be fixed regardless of when TE takes effect.  What parts of the code do you need to change?  Would it not make sense to do this now then create a bunch of new code for dPow that you then have to work around?  Fix your issues first before trying to impl new features.


[24-Jan-20 09:24 AM] Biz#0842
When the effect is 5 years out, it can wait. Emission is touchy.


[24-Jan-20 09:25 AM] Biz#0842
I don‚Äôt plan on writing any rules into block reward, due to jl777 and my arrangement. If that arrangement has changed, then that design will change. But then, so has our arrangement. Things have been written as they are, under that assumption. But not without flexibility to change


[24-Jan-20 09:26 AM] Biz#0842
Regardless. There is a bigger issue in the premine from Nerva code, not being taken into emissions account. @dukeleto can shed light on that one, as they encountered the exact same issue with a hardcoded premine and its eventual effect on emission in Hush

[24-Jan-20 11:47 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Hooftly i think the gist Biz linked to describes the situation clearly in Hush (which is a source code fork of KMD), but I can answer questions if you have them. I don't much about Nerva at all, don't claim to know their codebase at all. Also, I agree with Biz that getting dpow into production (something that has months of work behind it) is more pressing than fixing a bug that we know exactly when it happens and it's years out. Bitcoin Core knows that 32bit data types in the internals will break and a hard fork of BTC will definitely need to be done in the 2100's, but other things need to be done first.


[24-Jan-20 11:49 AM] dukeleto#7326
and speaking from a code perspective, the code that calculates emissions is probably self-contained and not likely to cause merge conflicts with dpow code. They could be worked on at the same time, given enough dev resources. But we know there is not much of that to go around


[24-Jan-20 12:06 PM] Hooftly#1337
Well he claims there is a bug in The Premine Code from Nerva Based on somthing you said and provided that Gist as "Evidence".  Its stuff like this that kept getting said in his discord that caused me to speak up becuse frankly its blatant and malicious disinformation about his upstream project.  There is no Bug.  That be like you Guys saying there is a Bug in Zcash because so and so who runs an asset chain said there is but then provided a Gist and Code Example from Stellar Lumens Repo as evidence of said bug in Zcash.

Can you see how this is wrong?


[24-Jan-20 12:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Hooftly i see what you are saying, i see what Biz is saying, and I think this is miscommunication going on, and valid points being made on both sides


[24-Jan-20 12:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
The thing that happened in HUSH is unique to what those devs did, with a BTC-like halving schedule. It's very different than any *potential* bug in the emission curve of XNV or BLUR. I would like to clarify what Biz said: I do not know if there is a bug in the emission schedule of XNV + BLUR, Biz did talk to me about it at length, but I am not expert enough in CN codebases to say. If there is a bug, surely somebody can point to the line(s) of code the bug lives at, and exactly when/what will happen


[24-Jan-20 12:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
Biz likes to think in the abstract, and he did make a valid abstract connection between potential supply bugs with this hard-to-parse statement `It‚Äôs specific to hardcoded premines, and an unaccounted for emission bias`


[24-Jan-20 12:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
IF XNV devs increased block rewards for early blocks and did not alter the emission schedule they inherited from, then basic math tells us there is likely a supply bug. That is what Biz was trying to make a point of.


[24-Jan-20 12:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
And again, I have no evidence of supply bugs in XNV/BLUR, but if it's so contested by both communities, both communities should publish their proof/disproof of said bugs and just get on with it


[24-Jan-20 12:33 PM] Hooftly#1337
We have been asking for proof of all the Bugs that he as Claimed exist that are non existent.  Surely we can agree that the burden of proof is on the person disclosing a potential bug and not the other way around?


[24-Jan-20 12:33 PM] Hooftly#1337
As I said Earlier if he knows of a bug please file an Issue with the code that shows said bug!


[24-Jan-20 12:34 PM] Hooftly#1337

@CrisF irrelevant. The guy who pinged you left the server.

enough of this puppet show pls.


[24-Jan-20 02:44 PM] CrisF#3405
Archive this, saving the content related to `technical discussion surrounding dPoW` and start an ANN channel for BLUR?

Will need to give time for others to add their thought.


[24-Jan-20 02:46 PM] Biz#0842
Requesting that this channel stay open for updates.


[24-Jan-20 02:46 PM] Biz#0842
Me not subjecting myself to the lack of hygiene is different from disallowing discussion


[24-Jan-20 02:47 PM] Biz#0842
Our blur Moderators will be forwarding messages from Blur Discord to here. I'm just not dealing with the antics of Fart and Co.  That doesn't mean discussion should be off-limits.


[24-Jan-20 02:50 PM] Biz#0842
--

I've no need for moderation, if things can be kept productive. but this channel has begun getting in the way of my productivity.  I don't take that lightly.  So I removed myself.  I've done this with other discords, where these guys have popped up. and it's to preserve my ability to focus on what matters -- the code.  For most intents and purposes, moderators from BLUR Discord @4ever @Jules will relay messages from our discord... for anyone not wanting updates by-proxy...

Our discord is in the pinned messages.

Thank you @Deleted User.  
You have a complaint that the rules were violated and you would like that addressed.
You would like a decision made on changing the channel to an ANN channel.
You would like to discuss 'KMD methods' of decision making?
Is my summary of your thoughts on the issue correct?  Anything to add to that?


[24-Jan-20 03:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
I would like a fair conversation with @Farl . The fate of this channel is up to you. We do not need more side conversation of summoning other people for questioning here. It detracts more from the original technical discussion

I was really thinking we'd made a breakthrough with some really productive conversation about the practical application of dpow to the blur chain. But if discussing basic principles like how you're actually going to run the required number of nodes etc is outside the scope of the discussion, then please inform us as to what we are allowed to discuss. As for baseless claims of bugs, the monero vulnerability response team have told him many times to go away cause he says bugs and vulnerabilities exist but is unable to provide any evidence of solid reasoning. It's just his thing. Says all the upstream projects are bugged, but he's fixing them all. Bit we aren't allowed to know what. Blur marketing.

@Fart Master "who is actually going to run the blur dpow network? who will pay the ops? who pays for servers?" is a very valid question, imho. And I have seen Biz try to report bugs to Monero and from the outside, it doesn't look good with how Monero treats Biz. I am not saying Biz is 100% correct about all the bugs he thinks exists. I am saying, it sure would reflect better on Monero to take Biz's reports seriously and *seriously* dispel them, if they are wrong. Instead, things devolve pretty badly into 4chan/8chan level stuff

[24-Jan-20 03:56 PM] CrisF#3405
Hi @Fart Master,

Yeah, that was a very productive discussion.  I got a lot from that and am hungry for more like that.

The channel was made for `For technical discussion surrounding dPoW.` according to the topic.  I got a lot of technical info from the NN discussions.

What is allowed for discussion is really up to the people discussing I think.  I imagine some people might like to move things back to productive discussions if they get too far off topic.

That seems to have happened when someone called for mods.

I'm curious if you have a way to keep things productive like they were above?


[24-Jan-20 03:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
Ranting about supply bugs of Monery, XNV and even BLUR is probably off-topic for this channel, that is a good point. This channel is about dpow+blur


[24-Jan-20 03:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
if we stick to the internals of dpow, attacking NNs, and all that, errybody is happy üëº


[24-Jan-20 03:59 PM] CrisF#3405
Yes, that seems like things that would get things of the tech and maybe better discussed in another place.

A new year and that means: more 51% + double spend attacks! Because coins won't implement the solved problem of Delayed-Proof-of-Work  + protect themselves with $BTC hashrate. $BTG just had some ~15 block reorgs steal ~$75K USD. Binance used only 12 confs!

[24-Jan-20 04:17 PM] Jules#2911
highly relevant CN space is still a target for this kind off attack


[24-Jan-20 04:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
That is how I originally found Biz+BLUR, I liked the coin and I was the main person adding dpow to BTC forks. It seemed like a perfect match, to see if dpow could work for Blur. The dpow algorithm is very abstract and can in theory be implemented for any PoW hash of any size, but since CN coins have 256bit block hashes, dpow doesn't care much at all


[24-Jan-20 04:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
256 bits of data looks the same to dpow, regardless of PoW algo


[24-Jan-20 04:19 PM] Jules#2911
i still remember monero team saying it can't be done

@Jules in the beginning, it was not clear to me or biz if CN coins could make checkpoints at run-time. maybe some forks can or can't


[24-Jan-20 04:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
once we saw they could, at least in Blur codebase, it seemed it was viable


[24-Jan-20 04:21 PM] dukeleto#7326

I think DPoW, in general, is very strategic for small Monero forks, otherwise, you must constantly spend so much energy changing PoW algos hoping to fend off 51% attacks


[24-Jan-20 04:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
It's strategic for the entire CN/Monero fork world to have this tech, to at least choose from. These stupid attacks are a solved problem.

@dukeleto history is the problem between biz and monero. I have seen the situation devolve from cordial conversation to where we stand now that they consider biz to be a pest and a time waster and it is for the exact reasons previously mentioned here. Consistently saying there are bugs but refusing to accurately and concisely disclose what they are. It's been happening a lot. Quite simply, if biz is able to identify and explain an issue he has found, then he will be taken seriously. Until then there is nothing to dispel. How do you argue someone is wrong when they won't even fully explain their position?

[24-Jan-20 05:33 PM] Biz#0842
Think what duke was getting at with OTF checkpointing, is that CN has none.  Was never a question of whether or not that was possible.  IIRC, DPoW was said to be "incompatible" with CN.  But that much has been proven incorrect

Monero and it's capabilities are within scope here. Blur is a monero fork and inherits features from that project. Monero, and subsequently blur  are capable of OTF checkpointing out of the box. Look up moneropulse.


[24-Jan-20 09:36 PM] jl777c#5810
having checkpointing built in is good, but not enough, additional checks needs to be added, at least in the bitcoin protocol and the way it deals with reorgs. no idea about CN codebase details


[24-Jan-20 10:07 PM] CrisF#3405
Seem that the uses for notarizations, apart from security, aren't often mentioned.
Will notarizations allow Blur to make use of the tech that they make possible?
nSPV or cross chain migration or syncing for example?

@Fart Master as a Bitcoin person knowing only about BTC protocol stuff, *I* personally didn't know if run-time checkpoints were possible (I even talked to a few Monero fork devs from zawy's LWMA discord, and it wasn't something obvious for people. Maybe my terminology confused them. Biz was the one that verified *to me* that they were possible, at least in Blur codebase

Are you planning a hardfork to make this public? That code, particularly the tx version change looks like a hardfork will be required


[01-Feb-20 07:23 AM] Biz#0842
Yes, DPoW is a hardforking change.


[01-Feb-20 07:25 AM] Biz#0842
But tx version is not the reason, consensus rules are.


[02-Feb-20 01:30 AM] Fart Master#6647
ü§¶


[02-Feb-20 05:32 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Biz @Fart Master some clarification is in order here, and I can give it


[02-Feb-20 05:33 AM] dukeleto#7326
dpow is indeed a consensus rule change BUT, if no notarization xtns exist yet in the network, it's essentially a no-op. So, you can add dpow consensus rules to the full node in a normal release, before notaries are actually injecting data into the network


[02-Feb-20 05:34 AM] dukeleto#7326
at some point, you do want to force a mandatory update so everybody is on new consensus rules, by the time notaries are injecting data, otherwise, an attacker will use non-updated nodes against the new dpow "honest" nodes


[02-Feb-20 05:35 AM] dukeleto#7326
so it's an additive consensus rule change that does not really take effect until data is injected into the network. This gives some flexibility


[02-Feb-20 05:35 AM] dukeleto#7326
you don't need to do everything exactly right at one block height


[02-Feb-20 05:36 AM] dukeleto#7326
this turns out to be a huge feature and makes it more reasonable to add dpow


[02-Feb-20 05:37 AM] dukeleto#7326
So, the normal way a coin adds dpow is for the code to go live in full nodes, and nodes update, then later on data is injected into mainnet and nodes start using that data. I hope this explanation helps, let me know if I can explain anything else


[02-Feb-20 11:44 AM] Biz#0842
@Fart Master maybe you could explain why you think a new transaction version requires a hardfork?


[02-Feb-20 11:45 AM] Biz#0842
I see nothing that would necessitate that, if only notary nodes are the ones using them, and they have the same structure as regular txs


[02-Feb-20 11:47 AM] Biz#0842
Tx version was incremented for notarization txs.... but not because they use different semantics. this was done to add an easily distinguished transaction property, for differentiating which txs are notarizations. Nothing about that is  a hard forking change


[02-Feb-20 11:51 AM] Biz#0842
The multisignature transaction created by notary nodes is just a `split_transfer`. A hardfork wouldn‚Äôt be necessary at all, if we weren‚Äôt adding notarizations in a mandatory update... pretty much what duke said.


[02-Feb-20 01:27 PM] Fart Master#6647

[03-Feb-20 04:26 AM] Fart Master#6647
You'll take the miner code I made for you eventually. But you know sometimes I think of helping, then you give a condescending attitude and I have second thoughts. But isn't it fun to ask questions and be ignored? I thought it had to be since you always ignore questions I ask and instead complain about me repeating questions


[03-Feb-20 04:26 AM] Fart Master#6647
And whether you like to admit it or not, that GPU miner is more code than any of your friends in the blur server have tossed your way

[03-Feb-20 12:01 PM] Biz#0842
@Fart Master those Monero guys say awful shit about me, and to me. Not to mention untrue assertions, quoting things I *never* said....

But I `keep helping` and actually contribute code to core, once in a blur moon (typo- but I like it). 

You‚Äôre right that it‚Äôs more code than anyone aside from me has contributed. But, it‚Äôs still not a contribution to core. If you really want to help out, you can do things like PRing your speed-up.  That‚Äôs done, now, but I‚Äôm talking about the optimizations you added for the algorithm‚Äôs varint area.  I didn‚Äôt know string conversions were so expensive.

That much was helpful. But it would be nice, to have a simple, single PR where I‚Äôm not having to page through Nvidia code, rapidjson (*eek! Tencent!*) and incidental buffer size disagreement in rapidjson vs miner code.


[03-Feb-20 12:02 PM] Biz#0842
That could just include a small thing like the algorithm speed up.  I did actually use your work to give our miners a significant boost. So At end of day, I am still glad you opened the source code. 

I‚Äôm just letting you know ways you can help that are easier for both of us. Surely,  It would be much simpler than coding up a whole GPU miner from scratch (over your morning coffee, from what I‚Äôm told üòâ)

Didn't realise I needed to package everything as a pull request for it to be useful. Can't anyway, been banned. But you know and I know that I never wrote a GPU miner from scratch.

Check out that portion of the algorithm @Fart Master. I don‚Äôt use `write_varint`. I packed an int with a Union and bitwise operators. I didn‚Äôt ‚Äúuse your code‚Äù . I learned from it and avoided the rapidjson route your code went

 I‚Äôve Added a lot of code to DB recently for notarization transactions, including functions that store an index for each Ntz in DB. This struct includes block height (May change that to hash, not sure yet), a chronological index for notarizations on-chain, and the Ntz txns hash. Will be adding functions for fetching hash by index, shortly as well

Monero just had a ZeroMQ vulnerability too... so security-hardened holds up. We don‚Äôt have ZeroMQ, MiniUPnP, or any DNS-related functionality, including unbound & OpenAlias. We‚Äôve  completely removed all of these. Lighter, and better node security for operators. This cut out a huge amount of dependency code, each of which was a potential security risk. ZeroMQ is now confirmed risky, with that recent vuln. Regex + unbound + MiniUPnP doesn‚Äôt sound good to me either

Rapidjson has nothing to do with varints. And I didn't write any rapidjson related code. It is as it is in the xmrig master branch. All I did was add your algorithm mods to xmrig. As for varints. The block hashing blob encodes some values, like the timestamp as a varint. To not decode it as a varint is incorrect.


[04-Feb-20 08:30 PM] Fart Master#6647
And it should also be pointed out that the vulnerability you linked is related to zmq 4.1. it relates to an old outdated version. It was current in Ubuntu 16.04. the latest LTS release of Ubuntu does not use that version. So calling yourself "security hardened" based on that is silly


[04-Feb-20 08:30 PM] Fart Master#6647
Also, moneros DNS functions all rely on dnssec. Are you saying dnssec is a broken technology?


[04-Feb-20 08:35 PM] Fart Master#6647
As a final thought, back to zmq. It should be pointed out that use of the code is not mandatory. You do not need to use zmq. You can simply not allow communication through the zmq port.


[05-Feb-20 04:34 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Fart Master I would say DNSSEC is completely broken and useless, yes

[05-Feb-20 10:16 AM] Biz#0842
@Fart Master interesting to know that Timestamp is a varint. I assume that uses protobuf encoding, and doesn‚Äôt follow the comments in code (in `varint.h`)? Tpruvot raised an issue on this in monero repo, but I don‚Äôt see that the misleading comments have been removed, or amended


[05-Feb-20 10:17 AM] Biz#0842
Decoding it properly doesn‚Äôt matter in terms of our algorithm. An integer is an integer is an integer (intentional redundancy)


[05-Feb-20 10:43 AM] Biz#0842
Block-hashing blob is different though, there you‚Äôre right, since xmrig creates this on its own


[05-Feb-20 01:08 PM] Fart Master#6647
Xmrig creates a block hashing blob on its own? What? Did you even look at the code? And how do you not know how the block hashing blob is encoded. It exists in the blur code. You can easily see in the blur code how the block hashing blob is serialized and then extract the data required via the reverse process. You clearly don't know what you're talking about


[05-Feb-20 01:09 PM] Fart Master#6647
@dukeleto care to elaborate on what is wrong with dnssec?


[05-Feb-20 01:13 PM] Fart Master#6647
@Biz how does not decoding a timestamp properly not matter? If it didn't matter, then none of the code using that timestamp in the algorithm would matter. Pretty sure you haven't read or understood the code. Otherwise you wouldn't have said all this and wouldn't need to make assumptions


[05-Feb-20 03:40 PM] Biz#0842
variable length integer.  Encoded value doesn't matter. Decoded value for the math, does. You can represent a value using *any* encoding scheme. I'm really not sure what you're getting at. seems as though you're just running in circles trying to confuse yourself.

Perhaps, it is you that doesn't understand what you're talking about.  I'm having trouble following any logical basis in your words except for obsessive combativeness.  That would indicate you probably have some talking with your inner-self to do, rather than this endless ranting


[05-Feb-20 03:43 PM] Biz#0842
Now, I'll ask again, that the talk remain relevant to DPoW development, and productive talk. I see none of this in your words, and you never answer questions asked of you. You simply keep asking questions, so that you never seem wrong.


[05-Feb-20 03:57 PM] Fart Master#6647
I am asking you if you know how to decode a timestamp from the block hashing blob? Seems you don't


[05-Feb-20 03:59 PM] Biz#0842
Ah, I see the point of confusion... You think this is necessary for our miners to work.  Nope, information can be taken directly from the header, since there's no deserialization done unless you're using a third party miner.  Pretty simple to use `b.timestamp`, which is a `uint64_t`


[05-Feb-20 04:02 PM] Biz#0842
same can be done with previous block's hash (`b.prev_id`).  Can use a union and bitwise operators to pack an int, for that truncated value, too.  No need to read and write varints when we're not dealing with encoded values, to start with.


[05-Feb-20 04:04 PM] Fart Master#6647
Yeah, but that is using the built in miner. Not the a standalone miner


[05-Feb-20 04:05 PM] Fart Master#6647
Prev_id isn't even a topic of discussion. Bitwise operation is what I did. So if you did that, your using my code


[05-Feb-20 04:06 PM] Fart Master#6647
But I saw how you rewrote it in some weird not at all efficient way. That's up to you I suppose

@Biz you said you could derive a spend key from a view key. That would mean you can reverse a keccak hash. So you did say that. So yes,  @Morningstar is absolutely correct

Yes, not showing that the premine is intact is great "opsec", but as "motivation" for people to get involved (on any level) not so much "great"

Yes. Talk to us about monero keys and give us an example relating to Bitcoin. Do you understand they are different code bases and operate completely differently?

Although I find it quite funny that instead of reading the code you are modifying you're forming an opinion about that code based on a Bitcoin magazine article.

And just to make it clear  @Biz, we're not captivated by blur. That's rubbish. We are interested in the stupid things you say, but interested in the same way one might stare at a deformed person.


[11-Feb-20 06:58 AM] dukeleto#7326
Classy, in true XMR style


[11-Feb-20 06:58 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Biz so you are saying that blur notaries don't give out a viewkey that lets people see ALL xtns they make, but a viewkey that only lets them see notarization xtns. Did I understand that right?


[11-Feb-20 07:00 AM] dukeleto#7326
if so, that seems good. Right now in KMD, because of them being the same, a notary can have bad personal opsec, use their address for "other things" and everybody in the network will be watching every tx they do in every wallet, such as transactions to consolidate UTXOs which happen constantly, and are not actual notarization xtns


[11-Feb-20 07:00 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Biz there is probably a pure performance benefit of not storing unnecessary data on every node, the way you did it


[11-Feb-20 07:00 AM] dukeleto#7326
also, it isolates metadata leakage a bit which seems good


[11-Feb-20 07:01 AM] dukeleto#7326
As background, in coins that do not have `txindex=1` by default (all KMD/Hush coins have this), DPoW requires "watching" (adding as watchonly) all 64 NN addresses, which means in that situation all nodes will keep local copies of all NN txs (which includes mining, utxo management, actual ntz xtns, and "other")

@ComputerGenie loled


[11-Feb-20 09:09 AM] Biz#0842
@dukeleto not quite. Their viewkey is computable from the existing secp256k1 keys, as those values are used to seed generation of the viewkeys. 

However, spendkey is completely separate and not related in any way to those viewkeys. They are seeded using a random value, which is generated using libhydrogen (primitives are ed25519 and GIMLI permutations in that library), so, all notary node activity is transparent to those who care to look. This is intentional.

For purposes of the blockchain, wallets do not have the option of ignoring a given tx‚Äôs `extra` field. So, all UTXOs are checked by every wallet, provided that the `tx_extra` holds a tx public key, for which we have a private key. Kind of similar to how segwit segregates signature data, in BTC.


[11-Feb-20 09:10 AM] Biz#0842
So, in bitcoin speak, all nodes have `tx_index = 1` on Xmr-style networks


[11-Feb-20 09:11 AM] Biz#0842
There is an option to make those wallets not check Coinbase txs. But that doesn‚Äôt mean the data isn‚Äôt stored. It simply isn‚Äôt checked for outs received.


[11-Feb-20 09:15 AM] Biz#0842
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
Notary wallets also do not use subaddresses for Ntz txn creation. So there is an option there for these consolidation txs, or whatever, to take place on Subaddresses, which would not be not be viewed as an Ntz txn, since those txs use master keys (basic addresses, prefixed with `bL`) only. That logic would need to be added to ignore those subkeys, however.


[11-Feb-20 09:18 AM] Biz#0842
So, it would be correct to say that in these nodes, where viewkeys and spendkeys are mutually exclusive, that disclosure of a viewkey should not compromise a spendkey in any way, even if a spend pubkey & view privkey were given out at the same time. 

With keys that are hierarchically derived (as in deterministic keys) that bitcoin magazine post by Vitalik, seems to state clearly that this would **not** be a safe thing to do.


[11-Feb-20 09:22 AM] Biz#0842
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
There is also an option of not using these secp256k1 keys to derive viewkeys from. If we went that route, a Tx private key, and a recipient‚Äôs BLUR adress, would be sufficient for tx proving. That can be done on the BLUR explorer, the same way bisq arbitrators perform this auditing

[11-Feb-20 10:39 AM] Biz#0842
To your consolidation point: consolidations should not be necessary, typically, once Ntz sequences are started. Each notary node receives 0.00000001 BLUR when a notarization takes place, and sends that same amount whenever they sign a notarization txn. Only reason that they would need to do so is: if they don‚Äôt have any outputs to select from... when creating a ring signature (shouldn‚Äôt happen, if the wallet is funded anyway)


[11-Feb-20 10:40 AM] Biz#0842
Since notarizations only take place every `unlock_time + 1` or 16 blocks for non-coinbase txs, locked outs shouldn‚Äôt occur, since they will unlock at least 1 block before a notarization takes place


[11-Feb-20 10:41 AM] Biz#0842
If a notary node decides to use their wallet for other standard txs, it will adversely affect their ability to notarize.

[12-Feb-20 04:49 PM] Fart Master#6647
@Biz saying there is a vulnerability, when a cursory examination of the code you have been looking at for 2 years says you are wrong is not responsibly reporting vulnerabilities


[12-Feb-20 04:50 PM] Fart Master#6647
Like saying there is a vulnerability where you can derive a spend key from a view key.


[12-Feb-20 04:51 PM] Fart Master#6647
A committee... Is @Jules on that committee? I think it might be a stretch to call him "sharp"


[12-Feb-20 04:56 PM] Biz#0842
Seems you‚Äôre set on wasting your own time. Have fun


[12-Feb-20 05:04 PM] Fart Master#6647
So you have nothing to say now about being able to derive a spend key from a view key?


[12-Feb-20 05:05 PM] Jules#2911
@Fart Master even just the fact you keep mentioning me in pretty much every chat you write fart lets me know you see me as threat and i can assure you we are only just getting to know each other


[12-Feb-20 05:11 PM] Jules#2911
i look forward to more melees with you


[12-Feb-20 05:17 PM] Fart Master#6647
Hahaha. I only keep pinging you to check in to see if you have figured out if we're making fun of you yet. You guys are funny. Think we're shit talking you cause we're threatened by your presence. Could it not be just cause you say dumb stuff all the time? Your previous comment being a prime example. @ComputerGenie are you threatened by  @Jules and  @Biz?

are you an adult?


[12-Feb-20 05:37 PM] Biz#0842
Btw, before I‚Äôm off for the night: here‚Äôs a paper detailing this exact parent-child key issue, that also specifically references Monero: https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/956.pdf


[12-Feb-20 05:38 PM] Biz#0842
Note that it‚Äôs from two years ago.


[12-Feb-20 05:40 PM] Biz#0842
Since the security relies on the assumption that master public keys are kept secret (impossible in Monero, since they‚Äôre exposed directly by standard addresses), it would appear the situation in XMR is both rather grave, and is consistently understated/ignored by people like Fart. In situations like this, informing people of the possible issues is the only defense.


[12-Feb-20 05:46 PM] Biz#0842
`Note that for the vulnerabilities of the deterministic wallet and stealth address algorithms, as well as the problem pointed out by Courtois and Mercer [17], the essence is that the derived secret keys are not insulated from each other, neither from the master secret key, so that one derived secret key being compromised will lead to the compromising of the master secret key and all other derived secret keys. From a cryptography security point of view, this is a fatal flaw, as when a minor fault happens (say, one derived secret key is compromised somehow), the damages spread and the whole system collapses. As a counterexample, for a old-style wallet where each key pair is generated independently by running the key generation algorithm of the signature scheme, if a secret key is compromised, only the coins on the corresponding public key may be stolen, without affecting the security of other keys or coins. Furthermore, assume this old-style wallet uses cold address mechanism, where each public is used only once and the corresponding secret key appears in hot storage only when it is used to generate signature to spend the coin on its public key, even if a secret key is compromised somehow when it appears in hot storage to generate signature, it does not cause any damage, since the coin on the corresponding public key has been spent by the generated signature and the public key will not be used any more to receive payments.`

Parent child keys are not related to the relationship between view and spend keys


[12-Feb-20 06:19 PM] Fart Master#6647
So you are once again looking left when you should be looking right


[12-Feb-20 06:23 PM] Fart Master#6647
So I looked at that article. You say you can derive a spend key from a view key and provide a link to that article. That article talks about stealth addresses. Why do you keep providing "evidence" that does not related to what you are talking about? Unless there is a method detailed in that article to reverse a keccak hash which I missed. @Biz


[12-Feb-20 06:24 PM] Fart Master#6647
So it would appear  @Jules I have not been handed my own ass at all. If you were a smarter person and could understand the details placed in front of you, you would also know that biz has once again failed to provide evidence to support his claims of a vulnerability


[12-Feb-20 06:45 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
so, employ the system that Courtois and Mercer designed and be done with it ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


[12-Feb-20 06:46 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
```Our new method is resistant to the
leakage/compromise of one or several private keys. It
can also resist to other incidents at operation such as
bad-random  events.   The  price  to  pay  for  this  is  an
m-fold increase in the size of the higher level public
keys.  The size of the actual transactions which need
to be published on the blockchain does not need to
increase.```

Shame we have no replies from  @Jules or  @Biz as to why they keep trying to prove their incorrect statements with unrelated "evidence" although an article that talks about monero stealth addresses at least talks about monero. Marginally better than a Bitcoin magazine article


[12-Feb-20 07:40 PM] Fart Master#6647
@Jules why do you always leave whenever  @Biz leaves. Did you get told it was past your bed time


[12-Feb-20 07:50 PM] Biz#0842
Monero‚Äôs deterministically derived viewkey practice would be the new style... ‚Äúold style‚Äù are non-deterministic.  i.e. you‚Äôre wrong. But boy does truth elicit a harsh response from those benefitting off of disinformation


[12-Feb-20 07:50 PM] Biz#0842
Get some sleep. Borderline personalities and lack of rest don‚Äôt mix well. Clearly.


[12-Feb-20 09:34 PM] Fart Master#6647
Explain the difference between this "new style" and "old style" you speak of. Because you are still talking about the wrong thing


[12-Feb-20 09:36 PM] Fart Master#6647
It's funny. You say I'm wrong and you are right, yet you still can't actually even explain what is happening. You link to random internet articles that are totally unrelated. Just explain how the code works that makes you think what you do


[12-Feb-20 09:37 PM] Fart Master#6647
Cause as I said. To derive a spend key from a view key, you would have to reverse a keccak hash. You said you couldn't do that. So how can you derive the spend key from the view key?


[12-Feb-20 09:39 PM] Fart Master#6647
Simple question  @Biz. If there really was a vulnerability where you say it is, you could point to the code and show us. Happens every time. You read some random article on the internet and imagine scenarios that don't exist in monero. Explain clearly how you can derive a spend key from a view key. You said it was possible, now i am asking you to explain how


[12-Feb-20 09:41 PM] Fart Master#6647
It is also ironic that you claim other people are benefiting from misinformation when it is you that is spreading it. Saying there are vulnerabilities when there are not and then telling people you have fixed those and they should use blur. That is a deliberate and malicious attempt to profit by spreading lies and misinformation


[12-Feb-20 09:41 PM] Fart Master#6647
And you say you're not a scammer


[12-Feb-20 09:48 PM] Fart Master#6647

@Fart Master Your arrogance is appalling.  It would be irresponsible at best and negligent at worst for a project to not take these possible risk vectors seriously and do their best to shore them up.  Ignoring these types of things out of pride is a recipe for disaster.  Try a slice of humble pie once and a while and you might actually learn something.  my 2 cents.

One problem with this. Biz is unable to explain how any research papers relate to his code. There have been no fixes. Cause he doesn't even understand what those papers are saying to be able to explain it or apply the principles to code. Just the same thing over and over. Says there are issues, but can't explain them, let alone fix them

`3) The Vendor SHOULD NOT assume that the risk or impact of the
   vulnerability is limited to what has been identified by the Reporter
   or involved Coordinator.

   Rationale: The Reporter or involved Coordinator may not have
   sufficient experience or time to identify the full scope of the
   problem.  Sometimes, a theoretical vulnerability is later found to be
   more easily exploitable as a result of follow-on analysis or the
   creation of a tool. `

mental illness is one of the most ignored conditions in the world


[13-Feb-20 04:28 PM] Fart Master#6647
What I ask is for an explanation from biz. Didn't realize  @Biz's explanations were fictitious or absurd


[13-Feb-20 04:28 PM] Jules#2911
i said yours are


[13-Feb-20 04:28 PM] Jules#2911
please get help


[13-Feb-20 04:29 PM] Jules#2911
take a week off from the internet and enjoy some life outside your 4 walls


[13-Feb-20 04:29 PM] Jules#2911
exercise is great for mental health


[13-Feb-20 04:30 PM] Jules#2911
it releases endorphins


[13-Feb-20 04:30 PM] Fart Master#6647
So still refusing to answer the question. Why the resistance to explaining a vulnerability you claim exists?


[13-Feb-20 04:34 PM] Jules#2911
get in contact with mental health australia fart they are a charity


[13-Feb-20 04:46 PM] Fart Master#6647
That would an expensive phone call since I'm not Australian. Just a simple explanation will suffice. According to git, @Biz "discovered" this issue almost a year ago. Surely he's had enough time to work out how these keys are derived. Just answer that. Probably a simpler question. How is the view key derived from the spend key? Easier to answer that than how you might derive it in the opposite direction. Biz should know if he really did change the code as he claims


[13-Feb-20 04:48 PM] Jules#2911
i always thought you were australian i am from the UK where are you then?


[13-Feb-20 05:02 PM] Fart Master#6647
Like the clouds and the air, I am everywhere. So I am not going to ask a question, rather make a statement. If biz can't answer questions about code he has modified and his reasoning for modifying it, we can assume he has not done the work he said he has done.


[13-Feb-20 05:02 PM] Jules#2911
maybe you should go over the code he has posted


[13-Feb-20 05:03 PM] Jules#2911
you know how to code?


[13-Feb-20 05:03 PM] Jules#2911
so go look


[13-Feb-20 05:03 PM] Fart Master#6647
Well that code is a good example of going around in circles


[13-Feb-20 05:03 PM] Jules#2911
commits on git willpoint you in the direction you need to go


[13-Feb-20 05:04 PM] Jules#2911
i know the feeling of going round in circles


[13-Feb-20 05:04 PM] Jules#2911
i know it very well thanks to yourself


[13-Feb-20 05:08 PM] Fart Master#6647
Lots or adding and then later removing code. Then re-adding, then commenting, uncommenting, moving. Itt almost like he's trying to hide not doing it


[13-Feb-20 05:09 PM] Jules#2911
almost but not confirmed?


[13-Feb-20 05:09 PM] Fart Master#6647
Lots of deflection and misdirection in the code. Much like how you handle people asking questions


[13-Feb-20 05:10 PM] Fart Master#6647
More confirmed than biz's view key issue


[13-Feb-20 05:10 PM] Jules#2911
incase you missed the memo that is what CN code is like lol


[13-Feb-20 05:10 PM] Jules#2911
infact that part is inherited


[13-Feb-20 05:10 PM] Jules#2911
thanks for pointing out what most people already know


[13-Feb-20 05:10 PM] Fart Master#6647
No. The monero code is quite easy to understand


[13-Feb-20 05:11 PM] Fart Master#6647
It is biz's commit history that has issues. But you don't know how to count, so I don't expect you to understand


[13-Feb-20 05:11 PM] Jules#2911
you know when someone is trying to be nice and you insult them it makes it very difficult to be nice back


[13-Feb-20 05:12 PM] Jules#2911
i will put that down to you being socially awkward


[13-Feb-20 05:12 PM] Jules#2911
i forgive you


[13-Feb-20 05:12 PM] Jules#2911
but do try to be nice


[13-Feb-20 05:12 PM] Jules#2911
can you be nice?


[13-Feb-20 05:13 PM] Fart Master#6647
Lol. You people are trying to be nice


[13-Feb-20 05:13 PM] Jules#2911
i am trying but i must admit it is very difficult


[13-Feb-20 05:14 PM] Fart Master#6647
So in a polite conversation, someone asks a question and then that question will get answered. Unless someone doesn't know the answer and they would politely inform you they don't know the answer


[13-Feb-20 05:14 PM] Fart Master#6647
So is that what is happening here? You don't know the answer to my question?


[13-Feb-20 05:14 PM] Jules#2911
you have been told multiple times


[13-Feb-20 05:15 PM] Jules#2911
you still say you have not been told


[13-Feb-20 05:15 PM] Jules#2911
you have asked the same question 1000 times


[13-Feb-20 05:15 PM] Jules#2911
it gets boring after the 3rd time


[13-Feb-20 05:19 PM] Fart Master#6647
No. Nothing has been explained at all. Biz is just hoodwinking you. He posts some articles that most people don't understand and calls that proof, when in fact it proves nothing and isn't even related to the issue he claims exists


[13-Feb-20 05:20 PM] Fart Master#6647
Which is why I ask him to explain it, in plain terms how you can derive a spend key from a view key. If you can show me on scroll back where he explains that then fine


[13-Feb-20 05:22 PM] Fart Master#6647
This is what biz does. He plays bullshit bingo and says a lot of big words in the hope of confusing people and trying to sou d credible. Then someone who actually knows something about the subject matter comes along and he fails completely to properly explain himself


[13-Feb-20 05:22 PM] Fart Master#6647
It has also happened many times on the monero git issue tracker and on hacker one


[13-Feb-20 05:23 PM] Fart Master#6647
To the point the monero devs consider him a waste of time. All he needs to do is explain himself and he will be taken seriously. Yet every time he doesn't and is made a mockery of.


[13-Feb-20 05:24 PM] Fart Master#6647
Why would anyone want to be made a mockery of when a simple explanation would resolve all issues? Unless of course you really don't know what is happening and are just making it all up?


[13-Feb-20 05:29 PM] Jules#2911
you seem to know an awful lot about monero and hacker one and biz's reports


[13-Feb-20 05:29 PM] Jules#2911
have you really got that much spare time you can follow someone footprint all over the internet?


[13-Feb-20 05:30 PM] Jules#2911
you really need to get out and enjoy life fart


[13-Feb-20 05:30 PM] Fart Master#6647
Monero and hacker one is hardly "all over the internet"


[13-Feb-20 05:31 PM] Fart Master#6647
But you seem happy to follow a fraud, so good for you


[13-Feb-20 05:31 PM] Jules#2911
you follow him everywhere this is seriously unhealthy


[13-Feb-20 05:32 PM] Fart Master#6647
I am actually getting paid for this conversation, so I got time


[13-Feb-20 05:32 PM] Jules#2911
so someone is paying you to try and attack biz's project?


[13-Feb-20 05:32 PM] Jules#2911
makes sense now


[13-Feb-20 05:33 PM] Jules#2911
dont you think there are better ways to earn money than doing stuff like that?


[13-Feb-20 05:33 PM] Jules#2911
pretty sure that is a criminal offence in most countries


[13-Feb-20 05:34 PM] Jules#2911
now i know why you didnt want to tell me where you are from


[13-Feb-20 05:35 PM] Fart Master#6647
I already told you. I'm everywhere.


[13-Feb-20 05:35 PM] Jules#2911
shameful you should have some paying you to attack biz like this


[13-Feb-20 05:37 PM] Jules#2911
so basically you have no vested interest in biz just the fact that someone is paying you to attack him non stop


[13-Feb-20 05:37 PM] Fart Master#6647
It's funny the silly things you believe. Now I understand why you follow biz


[13-Feb-20 05:37 PM] Jules#2911
you said it not me


[13-Feb-20 05:38 PM] Fart Master#6647
My interest is getting him to explain the vulnerabilities that exist.


[13-Feb-20 05:38 PM] Jules#2911
yeah and get paid by a 3rd party for doing it?


[13-Feb-20 05:38 PM] Jules#2911
you really are an awful person


[13-Feb-20 05:39 PM] Fart Master#6647
I'm a blur contributor bruh


[13-Feb-20 05:39 PM] Jules#2911
getting paid to discredit does not make you a contributor


[13-Feb-20 05:39 PM] Fart Master#6647
I'm just holding him to account and not blindly following what he says


[13-Feb-20 05:40 PM] Jules#2911
that is espionage


[13-Feb-20 05:41 PM] Jules#2911
that is pretty low even for a person like you


[13-Feb-20 05:43 PM] Fart Master#6647
But you know if biz just answered my questions when I first asked them, then there would be nothing to attack him about. And maybe if you had of worked with me instead of trying to discredit my GPU miner we could have been friends


[13-Feb-20 05:44 PM] Fart Master#6647
But no. You said I was taking it and was a fraud. Well turns out biz is the real fraud


[13-Feb-20 05:44 PM] Jules#2911
your miner still uses the cpu and is not more efficient than a cpu


[13-Feb-20 05:45 PM] Jules#2911
hardly a step forward


[13-Feb-20 05:45 PM] Jules#2911
and you are not the kind of person that makes someone trust them especially when you have a 3rd party paying you to attack him


[13-Feb-20 05:46 PM] Jules#2911
dicredited yourself without any help on that one i am afraid


[13-Feb-20 05:47 PM] Jules#2911
question is who is this person and why do they want to stop biz so much?


[13-Feb-20 05:48 PM] Jules#2911
is crypto espionage an advertised service you can hire on?


[13-Feb-20 05:48 PM] Jules#2911
like the oposite of reputation management

{Reactions}
üêΩ 

[13-Feb-20 05:58 PM] Fart Master#6647
So little you understand. It does not require the CPU to mine. But I'll put your question back to you. What makes you think blur is so good that someone would pay to attack it in the Komodo server?


[13-Feb-20 05:59 PM] Fart Master#6647
But the GPU miner actually proved more of biz's claims and the selling point of his coin to be fake


[13-Feb-20 05:59 PM] Fart Master#6647
Multichain... Fail


[13-Feb-20 06:12 PM] Fart Master#6647

@Biz i remember when dpowconfs were just a twinkle in jl777's eyes, they are all grown up


[29-Feb-20 05:20 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Biz originally dpowconfs only affected return values from RPC, but then I extended it to all RPCs and all arguments, inputs and outputs (some RPCs filter on a number of confs, and those should be dpowconfs by default)


[29-Feb-20 05:21 AM] dukeleto#7326
otherwise, somebody asks to filter by 2 confs but internally it's using rawconfs to filter, and then returning data with dpowconfs, which is really confusing and weird


[03-Mar-20 10:59 AM] Biz#0842
@dukeleto sorry, just saw this! So I only patched it into the RPC calls for `get_transfers`. For some reason, there is also a parameter for confirmations in `check_tx_key` too. I‚Äôm unsure of why that is the case, still

i downloaded the latest release, synced the chain and mined for a cpl hours with 4 threads, it said it found a block and explorer has the blockhash.  says it mined to a stealth address but not the address according to my wallet (from what i understand).
is there mining instructions of blur or monero available? (link)


[24-Mar-20 08:37 AM] Biz#0842
@Mylo Im not sure what you‚Äôre asking


[24-Mar-20 08:39 AM] Biz#0842
Mining to a stealth address isn‚Äôt something that is supported, so you must be mistaken somewhere.


[24-Mar-20 08:39 AM] Biz#0842
Does your address start with `bL` or `Ry`? `bL` would be a standard address, and `Ry` a stealth one

You may also want to try issuing the commands `set refresh-type full` and then `rescan_bc` in wallet. If your wallet file is older, you‚Äôll need to run those commands to see your mined outputs

**UPDATE (April 8th, 2020): DPoW Development Progress**

**1.)** Code for transaction extra parsing/addition of a bitcoin transaction to BLUR-side notarizations, has been completed.

**2.)** Our codebase now has the ability to run `doublesha256` calculations for hashing of that embedded transaction.  Testing functionally, correct bitcoin hashes are returned for the embedded transactions.

See here: https://github.com/blur-network/dpow-blur#rpc-calls for an overview of what this makes possible.  Specifically, the note below `get_notarization_data` RPC call.  The embedded transaction, in that BLUR-Side notarization, is an actual upstream BTC notarization.  One may follow the link to the BTC explorer to see the `OPRETURN` data from KMD.

**3.)** A `has_ntz_data` boolean has been added to `ntzpool` transactions, for quick discernment of whether or not data is, in fact, embedded in a pending notarization.

**4.)** Consensus rules and checkpointing process, both appear complete, and consensus rules are halfway tested.  

**5.)** The public testnet for DPoW on BLUR can be accessed by using the binaries located here: https://github.com/blur-network/dpow-blur/releases/tag/test-apr8

**Work Remaining:**

**1.)** Testing of rollback cases for consensus code (this is the only portion of checkpointing code that has not been tested, thus far)

**2.)** Iguana integrations for actual cross-chain communication in real-time.

[23-Apr-20 02:29 PM] Biz#0842
@dukeleto please advise, as I was not sure on values to plug in for quite a few fields.


[23-Apr-20 02:32 PM] Biz#0842
I gather that many of these may be unnecessary, since BLUR-side changes may affect prior functionality.  See comment in above PR.  I think minimum functionality could be good for a v1 or at least testing.  But hopefully someone can point in the proper direction, whether here or on PR thread.


[24-Apr-20 01:33 AM] Alright#0419
@Biz I don't understand how this is meant to work with a XMR-based coin


[24-Apr-20 01:33 AM] Alright#0419
won't iguana be completely incompatible? What am I missing here


[24-Apr-20 06:46 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Biz how does iguana interact with all your new code? that file is how iguana knows the port numbers and genblock txid of your coin, the other fields probably don't apply


[24-Apr-20 07:51 AM] Biz#0842
I am not quite sure what modifications need made to iguana-side @Alright @dukeleto


[24-Apr-20 07:51 AM] Biz#0842
I did patch the notarization data stuff into our get_info RPC call


[24-Apr-20 07:52 AM] Alright#0419
unless you've made some serious work arounds, iguana is likely completely incompatible


[24-Apr-20 07:53 AM] Alright#0419
it was written as a BTC client originally, I can't see how you expect it to work with cryptonite stuff


[24-Apr-20 07:56 AM] Biz#0842
@Alright there have been serious modifications, Blur-side, yes


[24-Apr-20 07:57 AM] Biz#0842
Roughly a year of writing code


[24-Apr-20 07:57 AM] Alright#0419
is the blur client expecting a btc-like transaction?


[24-Apr-20 07:58 AM] Biz#0842
It could be KMD or BTC, yes


[24-Apr-20 07:59 AM] Biz#0842
We also create a back-notarization, on our side. That KMD/BTC tx gets embedded directly into a BLUR tx. And gets hashed using doublesha256, for hash lookup


[24-Apr-20 08:00 AM] Alright#0419
ok, so you'll use iguana only for the KMD side of things?

[24-Apr-20 08:00 AM] Biz#0842
Yes, that‚Äôs correct. See above for BTC hash calculation, and other notarization data


[24-Apr-20 08:01 AM] Biz#0842
Everything on blur-side has been completely rewritten and baked deeply into our existing codebase


[24-Apr-20 08:01 AM] Alright#0419
have you checked that each rpc command iguana typically makes is recreate in blur client?


[24-Apr-20 08:02 AM] Biz#0842
Just the notarization data and get_info calls.


[24-Apr-20 08:02 AM] Alright#0419
can't give a list off hand, but I imagine there are quite a few


[24-Apr-20 08:02 AM] Biz#0842
I left out the MoM stuff for now, as I was told it was not necessary. But wouldn‚Äôt be a lot of trouble to get that working as well.


[24-Apr-20 08:02 AM] Biz#0842
Notarization_merkle, is already a type of MoM, technically speaking

@TonyL you should compile the testnet branch


[06-May-20 10:02 AM] Biz#0842
Alternatively, if you dont want to use the testnet playground for notarizations, just launch your existing blurd with `./blurd --testnet`


[06-May-20 10:03 AM] Biz#0842
You‚Äôll see in your `get_info` call that you‚Äôre currently connected to mainnet

all of that is handled natively, by `blurd` & `blur-notary-server-rpc`.  Firing up the `blur-notary-server-rpc` with procedure here: https://github.com/blur-network/dpow-blur#create-wallet.

You'll see a link to pre-generated wallets, funded and ready-for-use on testnet, there.

Correct, I do not think that will be necessary.  And yes, I'll be providing funds for notarization tx's, from our pre-mined BLUR (first block's reward was 360k blur).

now have to undestand from what season pubkey should I use for that call in case if I've used pre-generated addys ü§î : 

```
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7779" --data "{\"agent\":\"iguana\",\"method\":\"dpow\",\"symbol\":\"BLUR\",\"pubkey\":\"$pubkey\"}"
{"error":"source address or dest address has no privkey, importprivkey","tag":"2943999209274401723"}

we have to pass this one

would be great if you can DM me BTC pubkeys from which you've prepared the test wallets or maybe there is a way to get my pubkey from blur daemon


[11-May-20 07:57 AM] TonyL#3577
however unlikely it'll work even if we specify correct pubkey :)
iguana will start to try call bitcoin methods which doesn't presists in blur as I understand:
e.g. https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/dPoW/blob/master/iguana/dpow/dpow_rpc.c#L614
or https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/dPoW/blob/master/iguana/dpow/dpow_rpc.c#L943

so to use iguana with blur some custom rules like a `if coin->symbol == "BLUR"` needed with some rpc calls analogues/outputs transformation
from other side even more modifications needed because blur managing inputs for notary txs creation on its end and generating/sign transaction without iguana
in general current blur-dpow implementation looks like a iguana just without broadcasting on KMD step if I understand everything correctly


[11-May-20 08:24 AM] TonyL#3577
so now iguana should validate somehow that privkey for our BTC pubkey is imported into Blur daemon (https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/566925255659225090/709379895314219008) 

https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/dPoW/blob/master/iguana/iguana_notary.c#L398 now it's checking this way


[11-May-20 08:26 AM] TonyL#3577
https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/dPoW/blob/master/iguana/dpow/dpow_rpc.c#L446 and `dpow_validateaddress` using bitcoin-like RPC `validateaddress` call and checking now if `ismine` field true or not
for Blur needed some different condition or (what we expected) some implementation of validateaddress to confirm if privkey for notary pubkey is imported into blur wallet

@TonyL  

You will find those here: https://github.com/blur-network/dpow-blur/blob/testnet/src/cryptonote_core/komodo_notaries.cpp

If you used a testnet wallet, that was pre-generated. Would it be helpful to make pubkeys available for fetching over RPC?

@TonyL 

Yes, your understanding seems correct.  If you wouldn't mind letting me know exactly which RPC calls are needed, I can create analogues fairly quickly.  The connecting of iguana and modifying our existing consensus rules to incorporate these, is essentially the last step.  

I do not think any validation needs added `iguana`-side for the pubkeys imported to BLUR daemon.  The notarization process will fail if any keys other than those specified attempts to make a notarization transaction.  But, if that is important on `iguana`-side, I can make those pubkeys available over RPC, no problem.  

Which RPC call is used for this on bitcoin-side?  I will ensure that the same RPC input is used


[11-May-20 04:28 PM] Biz#0842
Those BTC pubkeys are used to generate the viewkeys, as I said.  So a simple boolean would probably suffice, which would regenerate those viewkeys from the pubkey seed... and return `true` if the viewkey is found in the `notaries_elected` table


[11-May-20 05:41 PM] Biz#0842
You may want to make a condition for ‚ÄúCryptoNote‚Äù coins, rather than merely BLUR, though.


[11-May-20 05:42 PM] Biz#0842
As the same pubkeys can be used for any CN fork, once the wallets have been generated

@Biz is there a concept of "validate this address" in CN world?


[17-May-20 05:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Biz in btc world, `validateaddress` will tell us if an address is in the current wallet, and what it's pubkey is, if it's watch-only and if it's valid/invalid


[17-May-20 05:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
many things in btc software world call validateaddress to verify an address is in the local wallet before doing some operation and that is what @TonyL is talking about

If you‚Äôre using the new wallet, you wont be able to authenticate, without hard coding the new pubkeys, so that is the source of the signers index error

Maybe the issue with the `getblockhash`is in the formatting of JSON response. Do you know if the response needs to be binary data?


[20-May-20 10:43 AM] TonyL#3577
@Biz https://docs.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/smart-chains/smart-chain-api/blockchain.html#getblockhash response is JSON like a :
```
{
  "result": "08674c7a6ab6c40000d45e2094f2cafc6575bfcfdd1ce90fa0060fa573803024",
  "error": null,
  "id": "curltest"
}
```

UPD: oh, no it's not a json - I believe it's a string


[20-May-20 10:44 AM] TonyL#3577
hmm I've tried to use pre-generated wallet - let me re-check maybe I did smtng wrong


[20-May-20 10:47 AM] Biz#0842
Ah, it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs not returning as ‚Äúresult‚Äù with that call. I used bitcoin semantics, which I think said the field should be ‚Äúhash‚Äù

iguana trying something like a (what works for btc/komodo): ` curl --user $rpcuser:$rpcpassword --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "getbestblockhash", "params": [] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:21111` 
(note that calls executing address is `http://127.0.0.1:21111`, without additions like json_rpc in address)


[20-May-20 11:46 AM] TonyL#3577

[20-May-20 11:58 AM] TonyL#3577
maybe just `http://127.0.0.1:21111/json_rpc -> http://127.0.0.1:21111` will be enough ü§î


[20-May-20 04:24 PM] Biz#0842
@TonyL that sounds like it will work to me. I will look into how to do it tonight/tomorrow. Shouldn‚Äôt be too difficult. Our daemon also supports different formats of RPC calls, so I can try our others. 

Old style was `http://local host:21111/get_info`. Is that format working for `get_info/getinfo`?


[20-May-20 04:24 PM] Biz#0842
For get_info I did both styles, so if that one works, I will just port the existing commands into that format


[20-May-20 04:54 PM] Biz#0842
I think I know what to do. Will check back in once I get it worked out

FYI, POST vs GET appears to make no difference as far as success of call. I think you mentioned somewhere that you thought that to be a possible issue. Maybe, but doesn‚Äôt look to be the problem here, anyway


[22-May-20 01:46 PM] Biz#0842
@TonyL ported over both. Think they should work now, but if they do not, let me know and we can continue work on it


[23-May-20 02:36 AM] TonyL#3577
@Biz oh in the main I wanted to mean that problem is that

`curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:21111/json_rpc -d '{"method":"validateaddress"}'`

looks like 

`curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:21111 -d '{"method":"validateaddress"}'`

for BTC coins so iguana should call it like that

Yep GET/POST shouldn't make difference since it's JSON-RPC format - it was misguess most probably. 

Will test current option (`curl -X GET http://localhost:21111/getblockhash -d '{"height":1000}'` tonight but I don't think that it'll work

because it's `curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "getblockhash", "params": [1000] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:8332/` https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/getblockhash.html (note that server address finishing just with port for BTC calls)

@TonyL managed to get it to work, by going with your suggestion, and removing the `json_rpc` from mapping..

See here: https://github.com/blur-network/dpow-blur/commit/47c2d0d6ca6e0a7269e335112391def6333ec876

which gives us:

-    {
-        dp->symbol[0] = 0;
-        return(clonestr("{\"error\":\"source address or dest address has no privkey, importprivkey\"}"));

okay, in process of porting that over, actively, along with `calc_MoM`. I'll add the `validateaddress` to new mapping, while i'm at it


[28-May-20 02:46 PM] TonyL#3577

[28-May-20 02:47 PM] TonyL#3577
maybe thats because expected value missmatched with current stub value - have to check what exactly iguana expect to see there


[28-May-20 02:48 PM] Biz#0842
that looks like its trying to encode a bitcoin address, from the `7779` file


[28-May-20 02:48 PM] Biz#0842
i.e. WIFval


[28-May-20 02:48 PM] TonyL#3577
`"message": "Method not found"` looks like one more method is missing (not sure which) but second is missmatch in validateaddress response I guess


[28-May-20 02:48 PM] Biz#0842
okay. i'll have all of them added, momentarily. compiling w/ changes now


[28-May-20 02:49 PM] Biz#0842
FYI, `vY1k7HviUT4vgcR6xnjtxnowY7Kfa9QdJj ` is the encoded address i'm referring to, looks like same length as KMD address, but with a different prefix


[28-May-20 02:49 PM] Biz#0842
but i may be misinterpreting

[28-May-20 03:07 PM] Biz#0842
assumed so. any idea what should be done here, for a workaround?


[28-May-20 03:07 PM] Biz#0842
maybe just same values as those for KMD?


[28-May-20 03:08 PM] TonyL#3577
hmm yeah sounds like a good plan - so in case if there is validation in KMD daemon it'll find this addy and blur will return this addy and ismine:true on validateaddress


[28-May-20 03:09 PM] Biz#0842
ok, can change it


[28-May-20 03:11 PM] Biz#0842
still compiling, but `getblockchaininfo` is now functional, same with `calc_MoM`.  Haven't tested `validateaddress` yet, since latest commit. but it should work too

I think I have blurd up


[28-May-20 03:37 PM] Biz#0842
type `flush_ntzpool` into daemon, those errors are merely telling you that your wallet found a `pending_ntz_tx` in pool, which you've already signed.  You actually don't need the notary server open, for any of this testing.

@TonyL as far as the `validateaddress` call goes, I'm just going to have the call return the same field as your logging above, and same values.  

But, are scriptPubKeys unique? as in, different one for each transaction? if so, that may present an issue we need to work around


[28-May-20 03:48 PM] TonyL#3577
validateaddress still not passing if I enable the check:

```

 first one is a call to blur endpoint
second one to kmd daemon (it's fine that it's failing because I don't have alien_EU privkey imported)


[28-May-20 03:51 PM] Biz#0842
okay, i'll fudge it so that its a clean analogue anyway, for now


[28-May-20 03:52 PM] TonyL#3577
i think that scriptpubkey is the const value, but I'm not a huge expert in internal details


[28-May-20 03:53 PM] TonyL#3577
in validate address scriptpubkey will be always the same


[28-May-20 03:53 PM] TonyL#3577
if question was about that one


[28-May-20 03:53 PM] Biz#0842
okay, pushed the changes. values in `result` will reflect static for that address (changing address will not change result of RPC call)


[28-May-20 03:55 PM] TonyL#3577
`okay, pushed the changes. values in result will reflect static values for that address` in general iguana should only check `ismine` value so I'm thinking maybe it's just can't parse the response


[28-May-20 03:55 PM] Biz#0842
that was my thought, as well


[28-May-20 03:56 PM] Biz#0842
lets add the fields, anyway, just to be sure we can eliminate that route.


[28-May-20 03:58 PM] Biz#0842
if it still fails to parse, maybe we need to get creative with formatting again


[28-May-20 03:58 PM] TonyL#3577
I'll re-test tomorrow üëç 

 could you please add my pubkey for which I have a privkey:
` "pubkey": "03a8db38075c80348889871b4318b0a79a1fd7e9e21daefb4ca6e4f05e5963569c"` ?


[28-May-20 03:59 PM] Biz#0842
so, `a8db38075c80348889871b4318b0a79a1fd7e9e21daefb4ca6e4f05e5963569c` goes in scriptPubKey field?


[28-May-20 03:59 PM] Biz#0842

open your notary wallet with `./blur-wallet-cli --wallet-file <yourfilenamehere> --testnet`


[28-May-20 04:01 PM] Biz#0842
then, type into the CLI `spendkey`, and post the resulting `public:` field, so that I can hardcode that too.

I am also not sure about your internals, but depending on how that json is parsed, fields being out-of-order in the list could be causing the problem

oh right, it's C not python


[28-May-20 04:14 PM] Biz#0842
right, so we may need to pack those exactly as they appear in BTC.  I tried putting them in order, but our serializations are putting them in a strange arrangement...  that doesn't line up with order of fields in source files. I can dig to find out why, if need be

üëç (2) 

[08-Jun-20 01:58 PM] Biz#0842
@TonyL so, after talking it over... I think there is a fairly simple way to do this.  But, the explanation isn't quite as simple, so bear with me:


[08-Jun-20 02:03 PM] Biz#0842
our RPC interface has **2** options for the way `stdout` is formatted..

The *first*, is the JSON-RPC 2.0 output, that we already found out does not work.

The *second* is the API endpoints with methods trailing the end of the URI, like below:

```$ curl --data-binary '{"params": [1000]}' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:21111/getblockhash```

Will give a response formatted like so:

```{
  "hash": "59b031d83bd562a36a355d5a0ff223f55a28134bb1ebb82da7d4afa92c06644c",
  "status": "OK"
}```

From the looks of it, this will work better than the JSON-RPC 2.0 output, for a workaround


[08-Jun-20 02:03 PM] Biz#0842
-------------------

Now, for the easiest way to create a wrapper...


[08-Jun-20 02:06 PM] Biz#0842
when calling these methods, using the trailing `http://IP:PORT/method`... it is apparently fine to have the curl call formatted like below (despite the fact that a "method" is included in the curl call.. our RPC interface simply ignores the `method`, in this case):


[08-Jun-20 02:06 PM] Biz#0842
```
$ curl --data-binary '{"method": "getblockhash","params": [1000]}' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:21111/getblockhash
```


[08-Jun-20 02:07 PM] Biz#0842
**so, a wrapper that reads the `method` from your curl call, and appends it to the end of the URI *should* be sufficient**


[08-Jun-20 02:07 PM] Biz#0842
`method` can be left in place, which makes this a little easier than I originally thought.


[08-Jun-20 02:10 PM] Biz#0842

With that all said, I'm not sure how to most efficiently wrap your `curl` from iguana.  Is it best to modify the curl call on `iguana`-side, or `blur`-side?


[08-Jun-20 04:19 PM] Descartes#5580
Ultimately, a json 2.0 implement needs created to stay current in the technology space.


[08-Jun-20 04:50 PM] Biz#0842
> Ultimately, a json 2.0 implement needs created to stay current in the technology space.

Supporting JSON 1.0 from our current codebase is also not straightforward, so understandable to work around it for now


[08-Jun-20 05:09 PM] TonyL#3577
`With that all said, I'm not sure how to most efficiently wrap your curl from iguana.  Is it best to modify the curl call on iguana-side, or blur-side?` 
Hi!
Afaik the initial goal was to implement integration without code changes on iguana side. CA is on vacation till the weekend - I can discuss it later with him @Biz 

I thought about this problem a little bit too - maybe some intermediate json converter is simplest solution? Like a simple listener server (written on python or go maybe) - receiving a call from iguana, executing call to blurd, providing output in needed form to iguana and so on


[08-Jun-20 05:30 PM] Biz#0842
Sure, we can find a way to make it work with iguana, if necessary. I think it would make a lot of sense to just wrap the request on iguana-side. But I can try to work on it this week, and see if there is a way to get things moving before weekend. Thanks for quick response


[08-Jun-20 09:42 PM] Descartes#5580
So now we're getting into the realm of possibly using NGINX to rewrite HTTP calls


[08-Jun-20 09:42 PM] Descartes#5580
I may have to dust off the regex skills, because it could be a wild one


[08-Jun-20 09:46 PM] Descartes#5580
but that might be too hacky and best served without network sockets as an in-between, thusly best served with blur C code


[12-Jun-20 01:20 PM] Biz#0842
@TonyL I think you may be right about best solution being an intermediary abstract stub server, if the trailing endpoint formatting (in our codebase) won‚Äôt be sufficient for iguana to understand.

It seems like we could use libjson-rpc-cpp (https://github.com/cinemast/libjson-rpc-cpp) or similar for compatibility between 1.0 and 2.0 formatting


[12-Jun-20 01:22 PM] Biz#0842
Despite that repo claiming full support for 2.0 and only partial support for 1.0... it looks like there are other repositories on git, that use libjson-Rpc-cpp, with both bitcoin and Monero... so looks promising


[12-Jun-20 04:06 PM] Biz#0842
After further testing and tinkering with libjson-rpc-cpp, it looks like it will work.

However, if we can make a wrapper that might be more secure. Regardless, I should be able to reformat with some creativity and that library


[12-Jun-20 04:07 PM] Biz#0842
I am just worried about the security implications of running an intermediary server


[13-Jun-20 10:44 AM] Descartes#5580

[22-Jun-20 11:28 PM] Mylo#8306
@Biz  if you have received a response from team, that over rides my suggestion. also, depending on your resources/roadmap/expectations

my 2c (and i'm not a pro full time dev since 10+ years) is to use solution A as a temporary solution that will work for the temporary time.  3-12 months.
my opinion is because dPoW 2.0 is due to be written according to the roadmap.  https://komodoplatform.com/roadmap/
when dpow2 is in a concrete realized state, then moving from the temporary solution to dpow2 will bring blur into alignment with the latest version of the tech.


[23-Jun-20 06:30 AM] Biz#0842
@Mylo have yet to receive a response from the team, on a plan of action. But generally, yes, whatever solution is easiest is the best route to go for now. We can fully support 1.0 later down the line (we plan on doing so anyway, for better interoperability), or if DPoW 2.0 will support JSON-RPC 2.0, that will work too. Whichever the case, a temporary solution to get things moving quickly  (read: workarounds are fine) is what I‚Äôm aiming for.


[23-Jun-20 06:32 AM] Biz#0842
Of course, we will be tuning and improving our side of DPoW too. This is merely for the first iteration, since we are chomping at the bit to get this done in some form, ASAP.

Currently working on the above ^ managed to sort out some of the issues I was running into. Code will be inbound tonight


[16-Jul-20 02:38 PM] Biz#0842
So, I‚Äôve managed to get `blurd` and the `stubserver` communicating. I‚Äôm currently getting an authentication error on BLUR-side... but requests are making it through the client/server API framework, at least.


[16-Jul-20 02:40 PM] Biz#0842
I‚Äôve heard of people running into similar issues with cn rpc wallets. But our daemon uses no authentication by default.. so a little strange

**ANNOUNCEMENT: The BlurAPI server, for translation between JSON-RPC specs, and for iguana communication is functional!**

Please find instructions located here: https://github.com/who-biz/blur-api-cpp/blob/master/INSTRUCTIONS.md

Follow those to compile the server. You will also need to launch `./blurd --testnet` compiled from DPoW-blur repo, testnet branch. 

Once the daemon and BlurAPI server are running, issue calls to the BlurAPI server for JSON-RPC 1.0 compatible responses.

Also, the server communicates on port `8383`, currently. I‚Äôll change the default port on  testnet daemon to a different number, and ensure that the api server is on port `21111` so that your iguana scripts won‚Äôt need changed.

@TonyL I am going to have to restructure the CMake build process and targets for the libjson-rpc-cpp portions. It looks like your system is linking the package, which it shouldn‚Äôt do. 

You‚Äôll find that if you compile and install https://github.com/cinemast/libjson-rpc-cpp, that you‚Äôll be able to build the package properly.

@Biz great üëç  so as a next step/goal we can try to actually notarize on KMD with blurd+iguana I think


[27-Jul-20 02:29 PM] Biz#0842
Sounds good to me. Let me do some work first on the idle handler, within `blur-notary-server-rpc`, to add a notarization window of `26` blocks.

@TonyL can you ensure that iguana scripts reflect this value as well?


[27-Jul-20 02:29 PM] Biz#0842
That won‚Äôt take long at all. It‚Äôs currently set to trigger a notarization sequence, any time we see a ntz txn in pool, which would be too often for decent efficiency.

[28-Jul-20 02:20 PM] Biz#0842
Scratch that, needing to recompile binaries. They‚Äôll be up at the same link.


[28-Jul-20 02:45 PM] TonyL#3577
@Biz I'm on position for a test session üôÇ


[28-Jul-20 02:53 PM] Biz#0842
Nice! Just finished recompiling, and will be ssh‚Äôing into my VPSes momentarily. 

Quick question: is `freq:26` in KMD block-time units?  If so, we may need different values for this window. If iguana bases that on  calls to `blurd`, then not a problem


[28-Jul-20 02:56 PM] TonyL#3577
looks like it's a freqency in KMD blocks yep


[28-Jul-20 02:58 PM] TonyL#3577
since I'm not a C programmer and never went trough iguana source code fully I'm basing conclusions on assumptions and superstitions mostly

[28-Jul-20 03:02 PM] Biz#0842
Okay, so what is your chain‚Äôs target block time? Ours is 1 minute, so 26 minute notarization window


[28-Jul-20 03:07 PM] Biz#0842
Actually, in the blur testnet‚Äôs current state, it has been longer than that window, since last notarization. 

I would guess that if you just fire up iguana... the RPC responses will suggest a notarization should begin, even if that number is 26 on both sides


[28-Jul-20 03:07 PM] Biz#0842
I also got the binaries on my VPSes updated... so you are good to go, I think


[28-Jul-20 03:10 PM] Biz#0842
Do you have a way to simulate signatures on your end?


[28-Jul-20 03:20 PM] TonyL#3577
> Okay, so what is your chain‚Äôs target block time? Ours is 1 minute, so 26 minute notarization window
@Biz KMD target blocktime is 1 minute too


[28-Jul-20 03:20 PM] Biz#0842
Oh, perfect


[28-Jul-20 03:22 PM] TonyL#3577
do you set minsig requirement in `blur-notary-server-rpc` ?


[28-Jul-20 03:23 PM] Biz#0842
Yes, it‚Äôs in `src/cryptonote_config.h` as a precompiled constant. It‚Äôs baked into consensus rules too


[28-Jul-20 03:23 PM] Biz#0842
Oof, it‚Äôs set to 10 currently. That will need changed.


[28-Jul-20 03:24 PM] Biz#0842
Or should we test at 10?


[28-Jul-20 03:24 PM] TonyL#3577
`Do you have a way to simulate signatures on your end?` I think I'm able to do it with some "real" setup


[28-Jul-20 03:24 PM] Biz#0842
Can be lowered, just as well.


[28-Jul-20 03:25 PM] Biz#0842
In our implementation, it can be scaled from 1-21 I believe, before we hit size constraint


[28-Jul-20 03:26 PM] TonyL#3577
with 1 signature it'll be easiest way to initially test


[28-Jul-20 03:26 PM] Biz#0842
My thoughts as well. I‚Äôll make that change now


[28-Jul-20 03:29 PM] TonyL#3577
ok, so I'll need modified here iguana https://github.com/tonymorony/dPoW/blob/master/iguana/3rd_party with same pubkeys and minsigs
matched funded addresses in KMD and blur, and up and running `blur-notary-server-rpc` - then lets see what will happens üòÖ

[28-Jul-20 03:37 PM] Biz#0842
Okay. It will take me a bit to recompile with the modified sig count. Also, you probably won‚Äôt need to run the `blur-notary-server-rpc` to complete 1 cycle. That‚Äôs only necessary for transaction creation, and `blurd` handles all network comms. 

I will check that those pubkeys match, in our codebase. They may need updated since last.


[28-Jul-20 03:37 PM] TonyL#3577
oh pubkeys from above are very old - no worries, I'll set locally on pubkeys from blur testnet codebase


[28-Jul-20 03:38 PM] Biz#0842
Okay, cool


[28-Jul-20 03:41 PM] Biz#0842
Will let you know as soon as things are recompiled, etc


[28-Jul-20 03:43 PM] TonyL#3577
ok, I'm thiking now too where it's best to compile/spin things. Probably will spin a new server now. Things became a bit complicated so messed up with bins/keys and etc


[28-Jul-20 03:50 PM] TonyL#3577
from running software need:
- synced komodod
- iguana
- blurd on testnet https://github.com/blur-network/dpow-blur/tree/testnet
- blur-api-cpp https://github.com/who-biz/blur-api-cpp/blob/master/INSTRUCTIONS.md
- blur-notary-server-rpc (for future operations, not required now)

actions:
- set correct pubkey in iguana pubkey.txt
- modify iguana 3rd_party with keys from blurd testnet and set minsigs in iguana as in `src/cryptonote_config.h`
- import address for pubkey into komodod, split kmd utxos
- be sure that corresponding address is in blurd  wallet and I got balance for it
- start iguana
- execute blurd dpow activation rpc calls: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/cMdMSPYV93/

see what will happens


[28-Jul-20 03:50 PM] TonyL#3577
just to summarize things, wrote for myself mostly üòÖ


[28-Jul-20 03:55 PM] Biz#0842
That sounds correct! 

You can compile testnet branch, and don‚Äôt need to set the minsigs unless you are changing from `1`. I just pushed that change to `testnet` branch. 

For now, those minsigs probably don‚Äôt need changed, since we are not testing out a new tx cycle just yet

{Reactions}
üëç (2) 

[28-Jul-20 03:56 PM] Biz#0842
But, If you wish to, just compile testnet branch with latest changes. `DPOW_SIG_COUNT` is what definition needs changed in config, should you need to


[28-Jul-20 03:58 PM] Biz#0842
I‚Äôll be recompiling and readying for test of a new tx cycle, in the mean time


[28-Jul-20 03:58 PM] Biz#0842
We will do that with 1 signature, first


[28-Jul-20 04:00 PM] TonyL#3577
started recompile too, afk to eat something quickly üòÖ


[28-Jul-20 04:02 PM] Biz#0842
No worries! Take your time


[28-Jul-20 04:02 PM] Biz#0842
I suspect this testing will need to unfold over a couple of days anyway


[28-Jul-20 04:09 PM] TonyL#3577
ouch, compilation failed https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/ZH4dDYSbk2/


[28-Jul-20 04:29 PM] Biz#0842
Yeah, mine too. For avoidance of errors, let‚Äôs use minsigs = 2, looks like my implementation doesn‚Äôt handle that case well


[28-Jul-20 04:29 PM] Biz#0842
I‚Äôll be pushing those changes momentarily


[28-Jul-20 04:29 PM] TonyL#3577
Cool, sure


[28-Jul-20 04:30 PM] TonyL#3577
However in that case I'll need second pubkey in blur for which I got kmd privkey


[28-Jul-20 04:33 PM] Biz#0842
Okay, we can change that too. Can you generate a second one?

[28-Jul-20 04:38 PM] Biz#0842

I'm afraid that deleted by `make clean` files blurd generated on old server, so probably we'll need to update keys array :((


[30-Jul-20 08:18 PM] TonyL#3577
I'll record private spendkeys next time... Am I understand correct that from private spendkey I'll be able to restore wallet?


[30-Jul-20 08:29 PM] TonyL#3577
so this time I've generated:

`public: 4896933c13adc197b7d0cc571559247eccbd11ed3d470acdf2853106df5b5205`

for

corresponding address is (need some testnet blur on it üôÇ ) : 
`b8g1g7YRzGLZP6HnEad86k773v13ah4DL2opPR39R5ZCEihZWf4ptufWKu2RJEaYJXVquZtALEV76Y9MhJi6fuQB2EK8aNkeW`


[30-Jul-20 08:39 PM] TonyL#3577
aha, for second pubkey its the case as well since there is no pregenerated wallet for tonyl_AR so will generate new blur public/addy now


[30-Jul-20 08:46 PM] TonyL#3577
for second node:

[30-Jul-20 08:55 PM] TonyL#3577
other than that I've compiled/tmuxed everything so will be able to try fast after testnet is updated with new public spend keys and funded addys

[01-Aug-20 07:58 AM] Biz#0842
That is simply because there is no one mining on the testnet, I think. It looks like notarization process completed on blur. Blocks just need mined. I‚Äôll confirm this later today


[01-Aug-20 07:59 AM] Biz#0842
Everything looks as expected there, actually. The yellow text on daemon-side is mostly just logging to ensure `tx_extra` (similar to `OP_CODE` in BTC scripts) gets handled correctly and visibly... this stuff will be pushed to a lower log level once we get things closer to production


[01-Aug-20 08:02 AM] Biz#0842
The ‚Äúexpected 1 got 0‚Äù warning can be disregarded mostly. I would bet that you have a tx in mempool, that‚Äôs a notarization. It just hasn‚Äôt posted to blockchain without mining. I‚Äôll spin up a daemon and mine 25 blocks or so, then notarization will be seen as final


[01-Aug-20 09:06 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh, that might be the case! I've got a suspicion the receiving same last height all the time


[01-Aug-20 09:27 AM] Biz#0842
What‚Äôs good is this means the `notarization_wait` triggered properly. Mining 26 blocks should trigger a new cycle as well. I will dig into this shortly


[01-Aug-20 11:02 AM] Biz#0842
@TonyL so, mined some blocks. Not sure what caused issue, but I got a segfault at first. Looks like notarization didn‚Äôt post correctly, but the request for more signatures did. 

Will get back to you once I have more info


[01-Aug-20 11:04 AM] Biz#0842
> iguana doesn't receive any incoming calls from blur so far, just my dpow activations calls
Could you elaborate on what you mean by this?


[01-Aug-20 11:08 AM] Biz#0842
‚Äî‚Äî
Also, do me a favor, please, and in your daemon, type `print_pool` into the CLI interface.. And paste stdout here


[01-Aug-20 11:21 AM] Biz#0842
So, I am not sure what occurred there, but managed to get a notarization posted to blockchain, by starting up another notary wallet on my seed node VPS. `notarized_height = 3362`


[01-Aug-20 11:32 AM] Biz#0842
Also, segfault looks like it happened because I didn‚Äôt do a `make clean`, and just recompiled.


[01-Aug-20 12:39 PM] Biz#0842
I‚Äôll be fixing that `expected 1 got 0` warning, as well. That‚Äôs due to lack of separation, between `ntzpool` and `txpool`, currently. I separated much of the functionality between the two, but some still needs separating into different functions.

There are a few changes, similar to this, that still need made BLUR side. I‚Äôll begin that work this evening. Will likely only take a couple of days to wrap up odds and ends.

```

```

I've meant that blur not tried to perform notarisation on KMD with iguana help


[01-Aug-20 10:05 PM] TonyL#3577
`Also, do me a favor, please, and in your daemon, type print_pool into the CLI interface.. And paste stdout here`

I'm a bit confused, daemon doesn't return anything on `print_pool` call nor print into stdout:

```
root@ubuntu-16gb-hel1-2:~# curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:21111/print_pool
root@ubuntu-16gb-hel1-2:~# curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:21111/mining_status
{
  "active": false,
  "address": "",
  "speed": 0,
  "status": "OK",
  "threads_count": 0
}
```


[02-Aug-20 02:24 PM] Biz#0842
Sorry, I meant typed directly into the running daemon CLI interface `print_pool`


[02-Aug-20 02:27 PM] Biz#0842
But it‚Äôs okay, another notarization was posted to blockchain anyway... so not necessary any longer. 

Does `iguana` need anything other than the last notarized hashes from that `get_info` call, to notarize to KMD?

My primary question is whether or not `iguana` needs to know who signed the BLUR-side txs. My thought is that it should not really matter


[02-Aug-20 02:28 PM] Biz#0842
@TonyL


[02-Aug-20 02:32 PM] Biz#0842
If it does make a difference to iguana, It could be easily recorded from the  `signers_index` field I‚Äôve added.

I‚Äôll just need to know how to relay that to iguana properly


[04-Aug-20 12:50 AM] TonyL#3577
I think we'll need help of one of the dPoW/iguana code experts such as @Decker or @ca333 to properly answer on these questions. Since now we have blurd <-> iguana RPC communication bridge it should be much easier than before to debug that down.

@TonyL @Alright do you know if there is a way to get the last notarized tx, on KMD, from iguana?


[16-Aug-20 05:29 PM] Biz#0842
I‚Äôd like to embed this full transaction into BLUR‚Äôs `tx_extra` field. There is already code to support this, but I‚Äôm not sure how I would fetch the info.


[16-Aug-20 05:30 PM] Biz#0842
A full transaction, or a hash will work. But preferably, the full tx.


[16-Aug-20 05:31 PM] Biz#0842
Feel free to tag Decker or ca333, if they‚Äôre better equipped to answer this. I just don‚Äôt want to tag, if they‚Äôre swamped with work


[16-Aug-20 05:37 PM] Biz#0842
I can cut these parts of code out, for time being, if this isn‚Äôt possible. But it would make things much more secure, if that data could be referenced on-chain by BLUR.


[16-Aug-20 05:39 PM] Biz#0842
We already have support for doublesha256 hashing. What I would like to do, is be able to hash that embedded data and then cross-verify it with KMD or BTC‚Äôs chain


[16-Aug-20 06:43 PM] Alright#0419
komodo-cli command `getinfo` has it


[16-Aug-20 06:44 PM] Alright#0419
just make iguana do this rpc call where ever you need it

**Summary of DPoW Integration Status for BLUR**

Below, you will find a summary of the work completed to date for integration of BLUR with KMD's Delayed Proof of Work (for notarizations to KMD/BTC and 51% attack mitigation):

**1.) All RPC calls needed by iguana have been added to the `blurd` rpc interface**

- The required calls from BTC API endpoints are all integrated to BLUR.
- These calls are made available over the `blur-api-cpp` (https://github.com/blur-network/blur-api-cpp) compatibility layer for reconciliation of JSON-RPC specifications.
- `validateaddress` call is currently a placeholder that will always return valid.  We are not sure if this needs changed, but will leave this decision up to KMD (if needed).

See footnote with link to `blur-api-cpp` instructions, to view samples of these RPC calls. 

**2.) Consensus rules for DPoW checkpoints on BLUR are complete**

- A notarization window of `26` blocks will be used, since transactional unlock time for BLUR coinbase txs is set to `25`. Standard transactions take `15` blocks to unlock.
- Each time a notary node proceeds through the notarization process, BLUR-side, an index for their pubkey is added to a field called `signers_index`.  We are unsure if this information needs relayed to `iguana`.  The signers can be easily communicated from this record, if need be.
- Multiple notarizations have already been posted to BLUR testnet.
-------------------------------------------------------


[25-Aug-20 01:06 PM] Biz#0842
**Things which require further code from BLUR, or attention from KMD:**

- **(KMD)** Whether or not `validateaddress` needs to have equivalent code (to BTC's) added for this RPC call. It seems that a dummy call is fine, however.
- **(KMD)** Whether or not `signers_index` values need communicated to `iguana`.
- **(BLUR)** Fetching last notarized hash from `iguana` for BLUR-side txs.  The transactional data upstream (KMD/BTC) will be added to the `tx_extra` field of a BLUR tx (code written already supports this).
- **(KMD)** Existing notary nodes need to generate their CN keypairs, following instructions here: https://github.com/blur-network/dpow-blur/blob/dpow/docs/Blur-NN-Setup.md.

*Instructions for setup of `blurd` and `blur-api-cpp`, for compatibility with `iguana` can be found here: https://github.com/blur-network/blur-api-cpp/blob/master/INSTRUCTIONS.md*

[25-Aug-20 01:07 PM] Biz#0842

Please let me know if anything above is unclear. Happy to discuss things further, as always


[26-Aug-20 05:05 PM] Alright#0419
I will follow the setup tomorrow and do some general testing


[26-Aug-20 05:06 PM] Alright#0419
`validateaddress` call likely not important


[26-Aug-20 05:07 PM] Alright#0419
don't quite understand the purpose of `signers_index`. Will need more info


[26-Aug-20 07:55 PM] Biz#0842
There is an equivalent field in DPoW, the name of which is slipping my mind currently


[26-Aug-20 07:57 PM] Biz#0842
I‚Äôll illustrate my motivations and its purpose, tomorrow


[27-Aug-20 12:17 PM] Biz#0842
@Alright its purpose is similar to the bitmask that KMD uses to keep a record of who-signed-what-and-when. I understand this is a choose-13 deterministic process in KMD. But for Blur, notarizations are signed on a first-mover basis.

It‚Äôs just a sequential field that scales with `DPOW_SIG_COUNT`. Each time a notary signs off on a notarization, their pubkey number is added to the `signers_index`. 

So, if minsigs are set to 13, this field is an array with 13 default values of `-1`. Each time a signer contributes to a given notarization, their index (`0-63`) is added to this field. This happens sequentially until threshold is met (I.e. array is filled with non-default values)


[27-Aug-20 12:18 PM] Biz#0842
It can be used to discern which notaries are participating, as a result.


[27-Aug-20 12:19 PM] Biz#0842
It‚Äôs necessary bookkeeping for BLUR. I am not sure it matters to KMD however


[30-Aug-20 06:30 AM] Descartes#5580
Good stuff.  This will help maintain trajectory with this project.


[31-Aug-20 01:56 PM] Biz#0842
Just posting here that Alright and I have begun setting up things for testing.


[01-Sep-20 11:50 AM] Biz#0842
@TonyL @Alright should we set up a group chat for testing? Or just use this channel? Would be more efficient to get dialogues all in one place, even if it‚Äôs just an assortment of tips for setup, etc.


[01-Sep-20 11:51 AM] TonyL#3577
Hi @Biz ! I'm on holiday till Sept 15th


[01-Sep-20 11:51 AM] Alright#0419
this channel is fine for me. Will want to doc stuff on github as well

@TonyL thanks for letting me know! Will avoid tagging until then


[17-Sep-20 12:43 PM] Biz#0842
@TonyL just an update that Alright found some necessary (for iguana) RPC calls I missed. 

I began patching those in last night. Expect to have them done sometime in the next two days. Will keep this channel updated on progress. I also set up iguana on one of the testnet servers... so I‚Äôll be able to verify if these calls are working, myself.

Expect that we should be ready for some scaled up testing early next week

Thats a great news! My holiday was good, thanks üôÇ Will be glad to join next week tests


[21-Sep-20 10:43 AM] Biz#0842
So, I‚Äôve gotten `listunspent`, `sendrawtransaction`, and `signrawtransaction` methods added. I‚Äôve not tested yet whether the dummy data in responses works with iguana. But, I will be doing so, later today.


[21-Sep-20 10:45 AM] Biz#0842
Also going to dig into `iguana` code to see if `decoderawtransaction`‚Äôs absence will produce a failure.


[22-Sep-20 02:31 PM] Biz#0842
@TonyL in my testing of `iguana` and `blurd`, I‚Äôm not able to progress far enough (in iguana‚Äôs cycle) to replicate the `getinfo` behavior, from your message here: https://discord.com/channels/412898016371015680/566925255659225090/736714892924551309

`blurapiserver` seems to pass address validation, and then get spammed with `getbestblockhash` endlessly. 

Any idea why `iguana` might not be making it to the other methods?


[22-Sep-20 02:33 PM] Biz#0842
My thought is that it may be because I do not have a KMD balance in the imported wallet... but, I‚Äôm not sure. I can‚Äôt imagine what else would be different between your setup & mine


[22-Sep-20 02:36 PM] Biz#0842
@Alright not sure if you‚Äôve managed to get that same result as tony. Input welcome


[22-Sep-20 02:42 PM] Biz#0842
If the other calls aren‚Äôt happening because iguana is waiting for KMD to sync, I‚Äôll have to upgrade the server size I‚Äôm testing on


[23-Sep-20 02:54 AM] TonyL#3577
`Any idea why iguana might not be making it to the other methods?` 
iguana stdout/stderr might help, usualy it prints error explicitly. Without error message it hard to guess what went wrong.
 Don't think that KMD balance is mandatory (iguana will print errors about missing UTXOs in such case, but on later stage), however correct privkey needs to be imported. Also you need iguana to be compiled with that pubkey inside (https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/dPoW/blob/c0d1892ed63e598a64e454ea701cc43cc7fbb4b6/iguana/3rd_party#L15), and write down it in pubkey.txt file in the same folder with iguana bin

Also followed instructions on  notary node setup docs. Things seem working, but the only RPC calls that are being issued to `blurd/blurapiserver` are `validateaddress` and `getbestblockhash`. Address validation happens once, and then a ton of `getbestblockhash`. I let things run for about 30-45 minutes, and those were the only calls that went through

[24-Sep-20 08:24 PM] TonyL#3577
@Biz Is your KMD daemon fully synced?

[25-Sep-20 09:14 AM] Biz#0842
Understood. I‚Äôll have to upgrade my server. I‚Äôll get that done today and finish syncing/bootstrap


[26-Sep-20 01:26 PM] Biz#0842
@TonyL can you send me the IP address of the server you'll be using for our iguana tests?


[26-Sep-20 01:28 PM] Biz#0842
added your pubkey to iguana's 3P config file, as well as Alright's, and my own. 

Also have 8 IPs currently in config. 7 of those are mine, one of which is the upgraded server. 1 of them is Alright's.  I'll remove one of my smaller servers, and we can add yours.


[26-Sep-20 01:31 PM] Biz#0842
No rush.  Currently syncing KMD daemon. Bootstrapped, so I'm currently around block 2060k


[26-Sep-20 01:33 PM] Biz#0842
Will post with results. I expect things to go much more smoothly with these changes.

@TonyL I will add your new keys, just won‚Äôt be back at a computer for a few minutes.

I did manage to progress past the `getbestblockhash` calls, which is great. As a result, `getblock` method is now being called properly. 

However, I need to modify result in `blurd`/`blurapiserver` RPCs to match verbosity that iguana is expecting.

Until I add the correct fields for `getblock` results, we won‚Äôt progress past that RPC.


[28-Sep-20 06:46 AM] Biz#0842
I fixed the `getbestblockhash` result last night. Prior to that, `getblock` wasn‚Äôt being called


[28-Sep-20 06:46 AM] Alright#0419
is iguana using getblock to detect `blocks % freq == 0`?


[28-Sep-20 06:47 AM] Biz#0842
Currently, yes. I removed `freq:26` for now

Testnet blockchain has to be actively being mined, or I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll see those `getblock` calls, however

@TonyL I'm in the process of adding your pubkeys to `komodo_notaries.cpp`.  Can you send me your CryptoNote public spendkey?


[28-Sep-20 11:36 AM] Biz#0842
You can find this by opening your wallet with `./blur-wallet-cli --wallet-file=<yourwalletfilename> --testnet`

and then issuing command `spendkey` to your running CLI interface.

Hey guys, sorry for couple of day delay. Got tied up with some other work. Jumping back into this tonight. Added a `time` key to our `getblock` response. Appears based on DPoW code that this key and `height` are both necessary.

After adding them, still not progressing past the `getblock` call, although it does appear to me that iguana is handling the response properly now.


[21-Oct-20 11:08 AM] Biz#0842
Just discovered I had left out the `height` key in blur daemon's kv serializations.  It's been added and I'm spinning komodod/iguana/blurd/blur-api-cpp back up to test. Will share results.

I'll keep digging to see what I can manage to fix.  But, if anyone can provide some clarification on what `iguana` is expecting *vs actual* in utxo error above, might speed up my discovery process


[22-Oct-20 01:18 PM] Biz#0842
@TonyL @Alright any insights?


[22-Oct-20 01:22 PM] Biz#0842
A more precise question: How many UTXOs are necessary (or what conditions must they fulfill) for iguana to proceed, without wanting to split them?


[22-Oct-20 01:39 PM] Biz#0842
Anyone else may feel free to answer as well


[22-Oct-20 02:11 PM] Biz#0842
I am perceiving that this error is related to the dummy BLUR ‚Äúutxo‚Äù, and not due to lack of UTXOs in KMD wallet, but might be wrong. 

(By "dummy" I mean that these blur UTXOs do not actually exist.  We are just trying to get iguana to treat the response as valid.  All of the BLUR-side ntz tx creation takes place on BLUR's blockchain.  We are faking the transaction creation for BLUR on iguana side, due to extreme differences between XMR-like and BTC-like transactions.  But iguana will still perform this function for KMD/BTC, as it does normally)


[22-Oct-20 03:02 PM] Biz#0842
Updated log above with recent changes to listunspent response


[22-Oct-20 03:26 PM] Biz#0842
Digging through code actively. So no rush on an answer. Will post here if I solve it in mean time.


[22-Oct-20 08:04 PM] Mylo#8306
Iguana looks for 10k sats value utxo by default. Maybe you have none at that value?


[22-Oct-20 08:05 PM] Mylo#8306
Two 3rd party coins use 100k sats because they have higher tx fees, is the exception


[22-Oct-20 08:06 PM] Mylo#8306
Noted on faking the utxo. Nice mocking :)


[22-Oct-20 08:50 PM] TonyL#3577
@Biz maybe you should add few more UTXOs to dummy response - since iguana want to spend this dummy utxo there is no UTXO for txfee at least. It looks like "not enough funds" error


[22-Oct-20 08:51 PM] TonyL#3577
dpow utxo in listunspent looks correct tho

just to be 100% sure - example of valid UTXO from NN (thats from KMD, for ACs there will not be an "interest" field):

Thanks for responses. I will be working on this tomorrow. @lightspeed393 private messaged me and suggested that I use the `acsplit` script to split some KMD UTXOs and mirror the format. 

I did the splitting earlier this evening and will be comparing to see where there‚Äôs misalignment tomorrow.


[22-Oct-20 11:09 PM] Biz#0842
I made duplicate UTXOs in testing earlier. But I suspect this didn‚Äôt work because they all had the same `vout` and same `txid`. I‚Äôll increment the vouts with each entry, and maybe we‚Äôll see better results


[23-Oct-20 12:44 AM] Mylo#8306
@Biz  txid the same is ok.  this happens when the one tx has many outputs.   when there are many outputs they are the different index of the value outs (vouts) array.

identical except vout array index, 5 vs 23


[23-Oct-20 01:41 PM] Biz#0842
So, changed `vout`s to increment each UTXO. Issue is apparently in `scriptPubKey` length in mock data, though. 

Looks like there is a conditional statement that checks length of this field. We‚Äôre progressing to that point, but failing that condition. As a result `haveutxo = 0`. Will fix. thanks @Mylo, that was helpful

doesn't look like we are progressing to `signrawtransaction`, or `sendraw`... will be digging in to see where things are stalling. Not sure if there are `nanomsg` comms that happen in between.

Compiling


[27-Oct-20 12:00 PM] daemonfox#6136
Do you have a suggestion on recommended VM specs


[27-Oct-20 12:00 PM] daemonfox#6136
I just started with four cores and four gigs of RAM


[27-Oct-20 12:02 PM] Biz#0842
That should be enough. Just add some swap space for compiling


[27-Oct-20 12:02 PM] Biz#0842
I think I‚Äôm running on an 8GB RAM vm unmetered but I wanted to ensure abundance of resources


[27-Oct-20 12:04 PM] Biz#0842
Also 4 cores


[27-Oct-20 12:19 PM] Biz#0842
`make -j4` on `dpow-blur` repo will consume more than 8GB of memory, without swap space, if using GCC.


[27-Oct-20 12:20 PM] Biz#0842
so, can either add swap space accordingly, or using `make -j2` will work. Otherwise OOM killer might cause a hang


[27-Oct-20 12:21 PM] daemonfox#6136
i dont like swap


[27-Oct-20 12:21 PM] Biz#0842
also, blur testnet is <11k block height. so syncing that chain will be very quick


[27-Oct-20 12:21 PM] daemonfox#6136
I run all NVMe in house


[27-Oct-20 12:21 PM] Biz#0842
just use make -j2 then. will take a little longer but at least you won't get hung up


[27-Oct-20 12:22 PM] daemonfox#6136
rebooting VM now with some more resources now that its up and live

[27-Oct-20 12:37 PM] daemonfox#6136
ouch


[27-Oct-20 12:40 PM] Biz#0842
cmake is good with backwards compat. haven't had a problem since upgrading


[27-Oct-20 12:40 PM] Biz#0842
but yeah, had to compile myself


[27-Oct-20 12:40 PM] daemonfox#6136
me too


[27-Oct-20 12:40 PM] daemonfox#6136

[27-Oct-20 12:41 PM] Biz#0842
build process altogether should work well. just went over the same steps with alright and tony

ah, you need `libreadline-dev`


[27-Oct-20 12:56 PM] Biz#0842
once you get to the creating your `btc.json` file, feel free to pause and we can walk through it together.


[27-Oct-20 12:57 PM] Biz#0842
there are also additional instructions here: https://github.com/blur-network/dpow-blur/blob/testnet/docs/Blur-NN-Setup.md

But they were written for permanent pubkey generation. since we are just testing there will be a couple differences between those steps and the ones you'll take

[27-Oct-20 12:58 PM] Biz#0842
for example, you will be sending me your generated pubkey, not kolo


[27-Oct-20 01:05 PM] Biz#0842
Also added `libreadline-dev` to that page just now. hadn't realized it was missing -- thanks


[27-Oct-20 01:13 PM] Biz#0842
will also be writing some scripts to make setup a bit easier. a few too many programs to have open simultaneously


[27-Oct-20 01:14 PM] daemonfox#6136
Ah you neat me to it


[27-Oct-20 01:14 PM] daemonfox#6136
yes that is missing


[27-Oct-20 01:14 PM] daemonfox#6136
i thought id be off work already but... couple calls rolling in


[27-Oct-20 01:14 PM] daemonfox#6136
we apparently broke a delivery record this week...


[27-Oct-20 01:14 PM] daemonfox#6136
$129M USD delivered this week


[27-Oct-20 01:14 PM] Biz#0842
nice! some weird opportunities coming out of the lockdown/tech interplay


[27-Oct-20 01:15 PM] Biz#0842
and take your time. i'm not in a hurry


[27-Oct-20 01:15 PM] daemonfox#6136
yeah


[27-Oct-20 01:15 PM] daemonfox#6136
we did get a nice wave


[27-Oct-20 01:15 PM] daemonfox#6136
our tech isnt the greatest


[27-Oct-20 01:15 PM] daemonfox#6136
but we were ready


[27-Oct-20 01:15 PM] daemonfox#6136
and our web throughput basically went 10 fold from last year while open store sales only slumped 10%


[27-Oct-20 01:15 PM] daemonfox#6136
now down to 8.5% for the year in store


[27-Oct-20 01:16 PM] Biz#0842
impressive


[27-Oct-20 01:16 PM] daemonfox#6136
so, might make it even


[27-Oct-20 01:16 PM] daemonfox#6136
but online just went hyperbolic


[27-Oct-20 01:16 PM] daemonfox#6136
and i helped link the things that ade it possible... was fun


[27-Oct-20 01:16 PM] Biz#0842
people like you are valuable right now


[27-Oct-20 01:16 PM] daemonfox#6136
watching $110M zp through these queues each week inspired me to figure out how to do it here


[27-Oct-20 01:18 PM] daemonfox#6136
and its off!


[27-Oct-20 01:18 PM] daemonfox#6136
10%


[27-Oct-20 01:18 PM] Biz#0842
nice, glad to hear. let me know if more issues arise, ofc


[27-Oct-20 01:18 PM] Biz#0842
will be right back


[27-Oct-20 01:18 PM] daemonfox#6136
yup im watching it


[27-Oct-20 01:20 PM] daemonfox#6136
50%


[27-Oct-20 01:22 PM] Biz#0842
60%-80% goes pretty quick. last bit will take a couple mins


[27-Oct-20 01:24 PM] daemonfox#6136
75%


[27-Oct-20 01:34 PM] daemonfox#6136
91%


[27-Oct-20 01:34 PM] daemonfox#6136
you werent kidding


[27-Oct-20 01:35 PM] Biz#0842
haha quite a few bins


[27-Oct-20 01:38 PM] daemonfox#6136
Woo!


[27-Oct-20 01:38 PM] daemonfox#6136
it built


[27-Oct-20 01:40 PM] daemonfox#6136
```From within the directory which holds your downloaded binaries,```


[27-Oct-20 01:40 PM] daemonfox#6136
So... the actual src folder?


[27-Oct-20 01:41 PM] Biz#0842
`cd ./build/release/bin`


[27-Oct-20 01:41 PM] Biz#0842
since you compiled yourself


[27-Oct-20 01:42 PM] Biz#0842
also, you will need to launch `blurd` with `--testnet` flag, as well as `blur-notary-server-rpc`


[27-Oct-20 01:43 PM] Biz#0842
so, daemon: `./blurd --testnet`
notary-server-rpc: `./blur-notary-server-rpc --generate-from-btc-pubkey btc.json --rpc-bind-port=12121 --testnet`


[27-Oct-20 01:43 PM] Biz#0842
otherwise a mainnet address will be generated (which is not what we want currently)


[27-Oct-20 01:44 PM] daemonfox#6136
im at make a wallet json


[27-Oct-20 01:44 PM] daemonfox#6136
but havent generated any keys yet...


[27-Oct-20 01:45 PM] daemonfox#6136
or, are we supposed oto be using our mainnet KMD notary key?


[27-Oct-20 01:46 PM] Biz#0842
your mainnet KMD `secp256k1` pubkey.  You should send that pubkey to me as well, so that I can hardcode it.


[27-Oct-20 01:46 PM] Biz#0842
(if its not already in `Notaries_elected` table)


[27-Oct-20 01:46 PM] daemonfox#6136
should be...


[27-Oct-20 01:47 PM] daemonfox#6136
so i need to match my not5ry name too


[27-Oct-20 01:47 PM] Biz#0842
notary name will be irrelevant


[27-Oct-20 01:47 PM] Biz#0842
that's just to help you keep track of wallet name


[27-Oct-20 01:47 PM] Biz#0842
i don't see a daemonfox in the table of keys I have currently


[27-Oct-20 01:48 PM] Biz#0842
so, they're probably outdated. I can add you. I'll just need that pubkey. Then we'll need to add your cryptonote public spendkey to the table as well.


[27-Oct-20 01:48 PM] Biz#0842
but we haven't generated that yet


[27-Oct-20 01:48 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok


[27-Oct-20 01:49 PM] Biz#0842
should be the same pubkey you have in `komodo/src/pubkey.txt`


[27-Oct-20 01:49 PM] daemonfox#6136
022d6f4885f53cbd668ad7d03d4f8e830c233f74e3a918da1ed247edfc71820b3d


[27-Oct-20 01:49 PM] daemonfox#6136
Compressed BTC pubkey of my mainnet KMD notary node


[27-Oct-20 01:49 PM] Biz#0842
cool thank you. so then you want to add `2d6f4885f53cbd668ad7d03d4f8e830c233f74e3a918da1ed247edfc71820b3d` as your pubkey to wallet json


[27-Oct-20 01:50 PM] Biz#0842
omit leading `02`


[27-Oct-20 01:50 PM] daemonfox#6136
btc.json?


[27-Oct-20 01:51 PM] Biz#0842
yes


[27-Oct-20 01:51 PM] daemonfox#6136
```{

}
```


[27-Oct-20 01:51 PM] daemonfox#6136
Cahnging that last part now


[27-Oct-20 01:51 PM] daemonfox#6136
forgot the 02


[27-Oct-20 01:51 PM] Biz#0842
yep. otherwise looks good


[27-Oct-20 01:52 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok saved


[27-Oct-20 01:53 PM] Biz#0842
okay, now in red you should see `Generated public spendkey`. I need that value


[27-Oct-20 01:53 PM] daemonfox#6136
im just starting the daemon now


[27-Oct-20 01:53 PM] Biz#0842
~~don't need to start the daemon~~


[27-Oct-20 01:53 PM] Biz#0842
ah, sorry. I'm a step ahead of you


[27-Oct-20 01:56 PM] Biz#0842
So, the two things I will need from you:

1.) Blur testnet address for funding - this should begin with `b8`
2.) 64-character `Generated public spendkey`


[27-Oct-20 01:56 PM] daemonfox#6136
started wallet


[27-Oct-20 01:56 PM] daemonfox#6136
it asked me to make a named wallet


[27-Oct-20 01:56 PM] daemonfox#6136
so I named it daemonfox_NA


[27-Oct-20 01:57 PM] daemonfox#6136
it asked for a pass I used the same I set in BTC.json


[27-Oct-20 01:57 PM] Biz#0842
did you use this line? `./blur-notary-server-rpc --generate-from-btc-pubkey btc.json --rpc-bind-port=12121 --testnet`


[27-Oct-20 01:57 PM] daemonfox#6136
nope i was going rogue and just trying to find a command to check the daemon status lol


[27-Oct-20 01:58 PM] Biz#0842
so, you should remove those generated wallet files then


[27-Oct-20 01:58 PM] daemonfox#6136
./blur-wallet-cli getinfo


[27-Oct-20 01:58 PM] daemonfox#6136
lol


[27-Oct-20 01:58 PM] Biz#0842
ah, yeah different conventions here üôÇ


[27-Oct-20 01:58 PM] Biz#0842
you can just type `status` into running daemon CLI


[27-Oct-20 01:58 PM] Biz#0842
`blurd` takes interactive input


[27-Oct-20 01:59 PM] daemonfox#6136
well dang wish idd known... i used &


[27-Oct-20 01:59 PM] daemonfox#6136
and dumped it


[27-Oct-20 01:59 PM] Biz#0842
`pkill -15 blurd` and restart with `./blurd --testnet`


[27-Oct-20 01:59 PM] Biz#0842
if you want to run as background task in future `--detach` is the flag you're looking for on startup


[27-Oct-20 02:00 PM] daemonfox#6136
I wanted to watch it and issue commands


[27-Oct-20 02:00 PM] Biz#0842
then yeah, don't use `--detach`


[27-Oct-20 02:00 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok where is the walllet file dir?


[27-Oct-20 02:00 PM] Biz#0842
pwd


[27-Oct-20 02:01 PM] Biz#0842
./build/release/bin


[27-Oct-20 02:01 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok


[27-Oct-20 02:01 PM] daemonfox#6136
so delete that named wallet and the named keys file?


[27-Oct-20 02:01 PM] Biz#0842
yes


[27-Oct-20 02:01 PM] Biz#0842
then run `./blur-notary-server-rpc --generate-from-btc-pubkey btc.json --rpc-bind-port=12121 --testnet`


[27-Oct-20 02:01 PM] Biz#0842
you should see roughly 8-10 lines of output once you do


[27-Oct-20 02:01 PM] Biz#0842
some of it in red


[27-Oct-20 02:03 PM] daemonfox#6136

[27-Oct-20 02:03 PM] daemonfox#6136
something didnt die?


[27-Oct-20 02:03 PM] Biz#0842
ah, `pkill -15 blur-notary-server-rpc`


[27-Oct-20 02:04 PM] Biz#0842
looks like you have two running notary wallets, or something


[27-Oct-20 02:05 PM] daemonfox#6136
rebooting


[27-Oct-20 02:06 PM] Biz#0842
ok


[27-Oct-20 02:09 PM] daemonfox#6136
awesome its syncing now


[27-Oct-20 02:09 PM] Biz#0842
üëç


[27-Oct-20 02:10 PM] Biz#0842
you had two daemons open, if syncing was the issue


[27-Oct-20 02:10 PM] daemonfox#6136
seems so IDK how


[27-Oct-20 02:10 PM] Biz#0842
think it was because you `./blurd --testnet &` at first


[27-Oct-20 02:11 PM] daemonfox#6136
likely


[27-Oct-20 02:12 PM] Biz#0842
FYI, looks like I have some majorly spamming logging enabled on `blur-notary-server-rpc`


[27-Oct-20 02:13 PM] Biz#0842
but, you can close wallet with `Ctrl+C` once its generated. opening `blur-notary-server-rpc.log` with a text editor will give you the info you need

okay, so move your wallet backup into `dpow-blur/build/release/bin`


[29-Oct-20 03:48 PM] daemonfox#6136
the second in worked fine


[29-Oct-20 03:48 PM] Biz#0842
cool


[29-Oct-20 03:49 PM] daemonfox#6136
it is there


[29-Oct-20 03:49 PM] Biz#0842
so, launch daemon with `./blurd --testnet`, add `--detach` if you want to background task it


[29-Oct-20 03:50 PM] daemonfox#6136
I copied them all off and zipped them with pass. the copies are moved to bin

[29-Oct-20 03:50 PM] Biz#0842
feel free to choose port, and/or use an rpc login


[29-Oct-20 03:50 PM] Biz#0842
that is just the quickest setup line for testing, for me


[29-Oct-20 03:53 PM] daemonfox#6136
its ticking

that method will return everything you're looking for, pretty concisely


[29-Oct-20 04:01 PM] Biz#0842
you can also check pool on running daemon interface with `print_pool`, where you can see the pending notas


[29-Oct-20 04:01 PM] Biz#0842
should you need to flush the pool, can do so with `flush_txpool` or `flush_ntzpool`. to flush whole pool, you'll need to call both explicitly


[29-Oct-20 04:02 PM] Biz#0842
ntzpool is just a partitioned area of mempool with different validation structs.


[29-Oct-20 04:02 PM] Biz#0842
once threshold is hit, `ntzpool` txs are converted to mempool txs, and can be included in a block.  Tx propogation isn't stellar, so I'll need to improve that a little. but i expect effect to be smaller when dealing with whole network

Do you have a legend of what the nota output lines each mean


[29-Oct-20 04:10 PM] daemonfox#6136
and their possible values


[29-Oct-20 04:11 PM] daemonfox#6136
I can assume most of the names


[29-Oct-20 04:11 PM] daemonfox#6136

@TonyL will add your new keys today.

@daemonfox I‚Äôll look into it. It‚Äôs happening over p2p comms from the looks of it

K


[30-Oct-20 01:28 PM] Biz#0842
@TonyL you generated a mainnet address


[30-Oct-20 01:28 PM] Biz#0842
you'll need to perform those steps once more, but make sure you launch `blur-notary-server-rpc` with `--testnet` option


[30-Oct-20 01:29 PM] Biz#0842
was the wallet we generated originally misplaced?


[30-Oct-20 01:32 PM] Biz#0842
alternatively, we could generate the testnet wallet from those keys above, but probably quicker to just perform the steps again with that one modification

1.) power them down. 
2.) remove `~/.blurnetwork/testnet/peers_state.bin`

cool. okay, so your change not coming through looks like potentially an error in tx extra parsing. this means my code for ntz_tx extras would be the problem.


[02-Nov-20 11:31 AM] Biz#0842
we'll wait for tony and give another cycle a try, though.

let me know when you're all compiled. we should try spinning up `blur-notary-server-rpc` once our nodes are all running

@daemonfox I just got an ntz request from you. if you don't mind, power down `blur-notary-server-rpc` until tony is running his node. want to make sure all of our nodes are on same state to begin


[02-Nov-20 11:34 AM] Biz#0842
just to minimize potential errors


[02-Nov-20 11:34 AM] Biz#0842
so, issue a `flush_ntzpool` to daemon, and `ctrl+c` on `blur-notary-server-rpc`


[02-Nov-20 11:34 AM] Biz#0842
can keep daemon running


[02-Nov-20 11:35 AM] TonyL#3577

weird. could you repaste the top couple of lines in `blur-notary-server-rpc.log`

ah, looks like that segfault i received initially with the `ntz_req` only happens if i'm actively mining. will refrain from doing so until after a cycle completes, so we can test a little more steadily

this is strange

can you open your wallet with `./blur-wallet-cli --testnet --wallet-file=<yourwalletfilename>` and then type `spendkey` and paste the public one that displays?


[02-Nov-20 12:02 PM] Biz#0842
it looks like your address isn't matching the one you sent above (a couple days ago)

sure, let me try

just different spendkeys printing by log and `spendkey` command

it could be that you still had that wallet. it wont be overwritten unless the named file does not exist already

[02-Nov-20 12:27 PM] Biz#0842
so, worked for you and I, but not @daemonfox


[02-Nov-20 12:27 PM] Biz#0842
interesting.


[02-Nov-20 12:28 PM] Biz#0842
I will have to dig in to see what is going wrong. 

fox, can you type `print_pool`?


[02-Nov-20 12:28 PM] Biz#0842
into daemon, and paste output?


[02-Nov-20 12:31 PM] Biz#0842
my VPS and local machine are both displaying that notarization worked properly. @TonyL please leave your notary server running. I'm going to keep my machine mining, and we'll see if we can complete a second cycle


[02-Nov-20 12:31 PM] TonyL#3577
sure, it's in tmux session so will be up and running


[02-Nov-20 12:32 PM] Biz#0842
I did not have my notary server running during the first cycle. so it appears that the issue @daemonfox ran into, occurred in `notary wallet <-> daemon` comms, but on a procedure that you did not experience.


[02-Nov-20 12:32 PM] Biz#0842
So, if  you or I run into the same issue on this cycle, I'll have a better idea of where the problem is occurring


[02-Nov-20 12:33 PM] Biz#0842
cycle occurs every 26 blocks, so will take a few mins

I am unsure of why so far, but sometimes my node will stop syncing until that pool is flushed. particularly if mempool state disagrees with a peers state

@TonyL can you confirm that you're reaching `listunspent` calls in your iguana cycles?

Will be starting work on this tomorrow. Don‚Äôt expect the bugs (Blur-side) to take too long to iron out. Couple days maybe


[08-Nov-20 10:51 AM] Biz#0842
@TonyL if that is all you are seeing, it‚Äôs because the testnet BLUR chain was not moving. I must have stopped mining. You should see `listunspent` calls roughly every 5 blocks, based on my observations

Hey @Biz Hope your family member feel better now üôè ü§û

[09-Nov-20 05:48 AM] daemonfox#6136
Just waiting on you Biz, say when, ill boot up the VM and start it up.


[09-Nov-20 08:02 AM] Biz#0842
Sweet. I‚Äôll be working on the blur-side stuff today. Made some notes last night ‚Äî will be implementing them today.


[09-Nov-20 08:03 AM] Biz#0842
And thank you for that @TonyL! Things are improving I think üôè


[09-Nov-20 03:55 PM] Biz#0842
Got a fair amount of work done today. Fixed coredump issue while mining. Appears to have also fixed the zombie daemon issue that @daemonfox was experiencing. 

Also added auto-flushing of `ntz_pool` once a nota cycle completes, and a new notarization is relayed. Notarized a couple times, and looks like things are staying nicely in cycle now, on blur-side.

Still have to fix the `tx_extra` parsing. Running into low balance issues, since wallets aren‚Äôt able to properly find signatures in the extra once ntz data is added there.

Expect to get that work done tonight or tomorrow. Once I do, we‚Äôll be a ‚Äúgo‚Äù for some more extensive testing, blur-side


[09-Nov-20 03:56 PM] daemonfox#6136
awesome


[10-Nov-20 04:51 AM] TonyL#3577
sounds pretty exciting üôÇ looking forward for the next testing round


[11-Nov-20 07:03 AM] Biz#0842
Got the `ntz_data` addition to `tx_extra` debugged and fixed, last night. Going to tackle `tx_extra` parsing code today. Expect to be ready for testing tomorrow.


[11-Nov-20 07:06 AM] Biz#0842
Function I wrote for the removal of this data is nightmarish haha. So, will be rewriting that one for clarity while I‚Äôm debugging it.


[11-Nov-20 07:07 AM] Biz#0842
I‚Äôll need to send some more funds to your addresses as well, since those initial nota extras are no longer compatible with the new structure


[11-Nov-20 03:39 PM] Biz#0842
Believe I finished the notarization `tx_extra` code today. Doing some more tests to verify things are behaving, and are formatted, as they should be.


[11-Nov-20 03:39 PM] Biz#0842
Will be varying input txs to this field as well, to see if we can get it to misbehave


[12-Nov-20 10:30 AM] Biz#0842
@TonyL @daemonfox, have verified that tx extra parsing code is now functional, and that transfers are registering properly. So, we‚Äôre ready for some cycles. 

Are you guys available in 4.5 hours or so (6pm EST)? Won‚Äôt have access to reliable internet connection until I‚Äôm back home around that time


[12-Nov-20 10:46 AM] TonyL#3577

[12-Nov-20 10:52 AM] Biz#0842

if not, you should do so prior


[12-Nov-20 02:55 PM] Biz#0842
do not `make clean`, without backing up your wallet files first!


[12-Nov-20 02:56 PM] daemonfox#6136
k on it


[12-Nov-20 02:56 PM] Biz#0842
you shouldn't need to `make clean` at all. just issue the same make command you did initially


[12-Nov-20 02:56 PM] Biz#0842
updated libraries will rebuild, ones that don't need updated will not


[12-Nov-20 02:57 PM] Biz#0842
every now and then there is a case that requires it. but this one shouldn't


[12-Nov-20 02:59 PM] Biz#0842
I haven't yet updated my smaller servers. but there are enough peers currently where things will work

this means loop isn't automatically completing, since block height is now past ntz window. I am wondering if yours is mirroring this behavior


[12-Nov-20 05:00 PM] Biz#0842
It looks like I need to fix some things regardless


[12-Nov-20 05:22 PM] Biz#0842
also appears there are some edge cases where `blur-notary-server-rpc` caches ntz request, when I intended it to be sent to pool whenever cache exceeds size of 2. Cache is hitting 3 in some situations, which was not my intent


[12-Nov-20 05:22 PM] Biz#0842
so, two separate issues i will fix asap

@Tylor zkFS 
You should have permissions to chat in this channel now.

To clarify on scope of blur-DPoW...

Functioning parts are as follows:

1.) `dpow-blur` repository (blur core) - this will be merged into our core repo once work on testnet is done. This includes blur daemon and a separate ‚Äúnotary wallet‚Äù for nn‚Äôs
2.) Standard `iguana` - interface with KMD network 
3.) `komodod`
4.) `blur-api-cpp` repository - compatibility layer for translating between JSON-RPC specs and creating ‚Äúbitcoin-like‚Äù responses to iguana, data fed through from` blurd`


[17-Nov-20 08:54 AM] Biz#0842
Just following up on our DM conversation, since it appears a couple things may have been unclear


[17-Nov-20 08:55 AM] Biz#0842
We mock the BTC-like responses, since ntz txs are handled (Blur-side) with protocol relay messages and a partitioned area of the mempool


[17-Nov-20 08:55 AM] Biz#0842
That blur-side checkpointing and nota tx creation is baked deeply into our existing protocol


[18-Nov-20 10:04 AM] Biz#0842
Managed to make some improvements last night. Need some tweaks to make things function as they should.. but expect to have those done today/tonight.


[18-Nov-20 10:04 AM] Biz#0842
At which point, once I confirm things in testing on my end, should be good for another round of multi-party testing


[18-Nov-20 10:07 AM] daemonfox#6136

@daemonfox feel free to power up your notary server. I‚Äôm actively testing. You‚Äôll want to pull in latest updates and recompile


[18-Nov-20 04:09 PM] Biz#0842
Added auto flushing and relaying functions to notary wallet


[18-Nov-20 04:10 PM] Biz#0842
Totally elective. I‚Äôm not doing any intensive testing, just letting things run a couple cycles

[18-Nov-20 07:31 PM] Biz#0842
All good. Things appear working properly with cycle logic. So, let‚Äôs do some tests tomorrow. I‚Äôll have a VPS mining with a single thread all night


[18-Nov-20 07:31 PM] Biz#0842
So whenever you want to power things up should be fine with the auto-relaying, now

Oh, may have spoken too soon


[18-Nov-20 07:51 PM] Biz#0842

It may just be that I need to flush my other seed nodes' mempool.  But I've been seeing this message the entire evening.. Unsure as to what triggers it, because it didn't happen for many hours this afternoon


[23-Nov-20 06:41 PM] Biz#0842
Could be that this is a real tx still stuck in pools... or that the hash displayed above is just the result of hashing a null tx blob


[23-Nov-20 06:43 PM] Biz#0842
Likely the latter since `tx.version = 0` which shouldn‚Äôt happen

Yeah similar then good notas again


[23-Nov-20 07:30 PM] Biz#0842
So, you‚Äôre progressing past the error at least?


[23-Nov-20 08:04 PM] Biz#0842
My notary servers may go down while I‚Äôm debugging over next 24 hrs. So I mean the above in past tense


[23-Nov-20 08:37 PM] daemonfox#6136
yeah seems to tick along


[23-Nov-20 08:46 PM] Biz#0842
Ah, that won‚Äôt be compatible with our network


[23-Nov-20 08:46 PM] Biz#0842
I do not think it is splitting that needs to happen


[23-Nov-20 08:46 PM] Biz#0842
Some sort of serialization or data marshalling error more likely


[23-Nov-20 08:47 PM] Biz#0842
I will look into it tomorrow. Spent roughly 9 hours debugging today


[23-Nov-20 08:48 PM] Biz#0842
Need to give my brain a break from looking at things


[24-Nov-20 05:42 AM] daemonfox#6136
lol wrong channel... embarrassing... thought i tabbed it to the other notary channels


[24-Nov-20 05:42 AM] daemonfox#6136
my brain was also clearly not in the place needed


[24-Nov-20 08:45 AM] Biz#0842
Haha all good!


[24-Nov-20 11:08 AM] Biz#0842

things i can break you want documented etc


[24-Nov-20 11:34 AM] Biz#0842
cool, will put some together


[24-Nov-20 12:23 PM] Biz#0842
going to let things keep rolling for a while under observation


[27-Nov-20 10:12 AM] Descartes#5580
How's the observation going so far?


[27-Nov-20 05:24 PM] Biz#0842
Went well. I‚Äôll hop back on it tomorrow. A bug or two I need to iron out before we scale up


[27-Nov-20 05:24 PM] Biz#0842
Expect to be ready to do so this week though


[28-Nov-20 09:42 AM] daemonfox#6136
oh boy


[30-Nov-20 01:33 PM] Biz#0842
Resumed testing today


[02-Dec-20 03:44 PM] Biz#0842
@TonyL @Alright @daemonfox you guys available for some further testing end of this week or weekend? Could use some others as well, if we can gather them


[02-Dec-20 03:45 PM] Biz#0842
Planning on scaling up the sig count


[02-Dec-20 09:25 PM] TonyL#3577
I'll be unavailable most of the weekend


[03-Dec-20 09:35 AM] Biz#0842
Early next week then?


[03-Dec-20 10:48 AM] daemonfox#6136
illbe around this weekend


[03-Dec-20 10:49 AM] daemonfox#6136
I just bit off more than I can chew for Dec


[03-Dec-20 10:49 AM] daemonfox#6136
Moving in 3 weeks


[03-Dec-20 10:49 AM] daemonfox#6136
so life is all boxes lol


[04-Dec-20 10:04 AM] Biz#0842
@daemonfox you able to spin up a couple nota nodes? I can run 6 myself presently


[04-Dec-20 10:05 AM] Biz#0842
Can expand that if need be


[04-Dec-20 10:05 AM] Biz#0842
As we are just testing BLUR-side stuff, just a matter of adding more pubkeys


[04-Dec-20 10:06 AM] Biz#0842
I‚Äôve also got a bunch of pre-funded nota wallets available for download from GitHub here: https://github.com/blur-network/dpow-blur/releases/tag/test-wallets so we don‚Äôt need to add new ones

[04-Dec-20 10:06 AM] daemonfox#6136
I could spin up quite a few if needed


[04-Dec-20 10:07 AM] daemonfox#6136
bur I dont have enough static IPs to make that feasible until after thw 21st


[04-Dec-20 10:08 AM] daemonfox#6136
on the 21st I get 8 more!


[04-Dec-20 11:11 AM] Biz#0842
That‚Äôs okay! I can run 6, or more. Let‚Äôs plan on Sunday for scaling up


[04-Dec-20 11:12 AM] Biz#0842
Then Tony can join at some point later on


[04-Dec-20 11:25 AM] daemonfox#6136
ok


[05-Dec-20 07:31 AM] Descartes#5580
This sounds like a job for....  KUBERNETES ü§£


[07-Dec-20 10:25 AM] Biz#0842
Will be working on getting things ready for scale up today. Sorry for being MIA yesterday @daemonfox. Had an active Saturday climbing mountains and needed some rest


[07-Dec-20 10:25 AM] daemonfox#6136
Was MIA as well... sent over a dozen boxes to storage end of day yesterday.


[07-Dec-20 10:26 AM] daemonfox#6136
Prepacking


[07-Dec-20 10:26 AM] daemonfox#6136
ugh


[07-Dec-20 04:07 PM] Biz#0842
Oof, that‚Äôs rough.


[07-Dec-20 04:07 PM] Biz#0842
wouldn‚Äôt expect moving to be pleasant though, haha. Never is


[07-Dec-20 04:08 PM] Biz#0842
But I‚Äôm wrapping up consensus rules, and figuring out where the txs with `version = 0` are coming from. Should have things ready for scale up tomorrow, if all goes well


[07-Dec-20 04:09 PM] Biz#0842
Did about 15 nota cycles today, while prodding and debugging


[08-Dec-20 11:08 AM] Biz#0842
@daemonfox so, I‚Äôm about to push some code that will increase `DPOW_SIG_COUNT` to 5. Once I do, feel free to recompile and relaunch things. 

You‚Äôll still see the data marshalling error, but it doesn‚Äôt appear it‚Äôs getting in the way of anything. 

After we do this, we‚Äôll run some cycles at 5 signatures, just to make sure things are working. Then, I‚Äôll add the consensus changes later tonight.

Once those consensus changes are pushed, I will need to relaunch the testnet chain. At that point, you‚Äôll need to remove your DB and resync the fresh chain.


[08-Dec-20 11:08 AM] Biz#0842
@TonyL would be helpful if you and @Alright power down your Blur nodes until the consensus changes are in. Previous ledger will interfere with a fresh launch


[08-Dec-20 11:08 AM] Biz#0842
If you still have them online, I mean


[08-Dec-20 11:09 AM] daemonfox#6136
ok


[08-Dec-20 11:09 AM] Biz#0842
Consensus changes  resolve some things I managed to break in testing


[08-Dec-20 11:18 AM] Biz#0842
@Alright I know you mentioned that it was important to understand what the fields in bitcoind-rpc responses mean.

I am gathering you said this because iguana performs some secp256k1 calculations, from my observations profiling/looking at call graphs.


[08-Dec-20 11:19 AM] Biz#0842
Do you by any chance know which operations are performed by iguana when it‚Äôs checking tx data?


[08-Dec-20 11:20 AM] Biz#0842
I am seeing a lot of secp256k1 functions pop up, but a lot of them are mathematical shorthand. I can dig into those myself, so my question is on a higher level


[08-Dec-20 11:22 AM] Biz#0842
If that‚Äôs not what you meant (or can‚Äôt answer), no worries


[08-Dec-20 12:07 PM] Biz#0842
@daemonfox sig count increase has been pushed. Feel free to update at your leisure

Sweet! I‚Äôve got all my nodes updated too. Should be in cycle currently


[08-Dec-20 02:15 PM] Biz#0842
I‚Äôve got 5 or 6 nota wallets running at the moment, so we‚Äôre performing at least at 5-of-7 or better


[08-Dec-20 02:44 PM] Biz#0842
Making some changes based on observations.


[08-Dec-20 03:51 PM] Biz#0842
@daemonfox you‚Äôre way behind the testnet chain height


[08-Dec-20 03:51 PM] Biz#0842
Current height is `31973`


[08-Dec-20 03:52 PM] Biz#0842
might want to resync. No rush, as Im debugging the spammy error messages

[09-Dec-20 12:35 PM] Biz#0842
Nice. Once I am home I will finish up debugging those errors. Then I‚Äôll start cycles again


[09-Dec-20 12:36 PM] Biz#0842
Seems it‚Äôs happening between RPC and protocol, during auto-calling of `relay_ntzpool`


[09-Dec-20 05:37 PM] Biz#0842
Okay, debugged and fixed. @daemonfox please update at your leisure


[09-Dec-20 05:37 PM] Biz#0842
I‚Äôll be sending things into cycle shortly


[09-Dec-20 08:32 PM] Biz#0842
You‚Äôll still see the error messages. But that‚Äôs just due to me only updating one server presently. I‚Äôll have to do the rest tomorrow


[10-Dec-20 09:51 AM] Biz#0842
Updating those seeds now.


[10-Dec-20 10:30 AM] Biz#0842
All updated and cycling. Will be observing for 2 hours


[10-Dec-20 11:16 AM] Biz#0842
Things going well with those recent changes. Will move onto consensus changes and relaunch of testnet chain, next.  


Most of the consensus code is already written and implemented, mainly for checkpointing. Need to add notarization lag to consensus, and tx checks for the nota block.


[10-Dec-20 11:17 AM] Biz#0842
Then, back to `blur-api-cpp` development


[10-Dec-20 11:17 AM] Biz#0842
Once that‚Äôs all tested, of course


[10-Dec-20 11:46 AM] Biz#0842
Oh, also @daemonfox, added auto-flushing on first run to notary server in most recent commit from today


[10-Dec-20 11:46 AM] Biz#0842
So, shouldn‚Äôt need to Ntz flush on startup any longer


[10-Dec-20 02:07 PM] daemonfox#6136
Word


[10-Dec-20 02:08 PM] daemonfox#6136
Tell me when and I'll update


[10-Dec-20 05:13 PM] Biz#0842
Cool. I may finish up the consensus rules tonight. Found the problem area in the consensus code I wrote. Fixing *could be* easy. Looks it for now, anyway


[11-Dec-20 04:21 PM] Biz#0842
@daemonfox those consensus changes have been pushed. I plan on relaunching the testnet chain on Sunday.


[11-Dec-20 04:21 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok


[11-Dec-20 04:21 PM] Biz#0842
Note that some of the blocks currently on testnet will no longer validate, as a result.


[11-Dec-20 04:22 PM] daemonfox#6136
my node is down


[11-Dec-20 04:22 PM] daemonfox#6136
just let me know whats next


[11-Dec-20 06:00 PM] Biz#0842
Remove data directory `~/.blurnetwork` can be done preemptively. You‚Äôll be syncing your fresh on Sunday... would be tm but I‚Äôm unavailable. I‚Äôm gonna roll back all nodes to just after hardfork v11 height.


[11-Dec-20 06:01 PM] Biz#0842
So, not a whole lot of action necessary just yet


[14-Dec-20 08:38 AM] Biz#0842
Will be rolling back chain today


[14-Dec-20 01:29 PM] Biz#0842
@daemonfox if you‚Äôve removed old blockchain history, you can power your node back up. I‚Äôm mining currently to get back to hardfork activation height


[14-Dec-20 01:29 PM] daemonfox#6136
ill work on that tonight


[14-Dec-20 01:31 PM] Biz#0842
No worries. I need to mine for a few hours at least to get difficulty to level out. Since I made the hardfork height = 20, our difficulty algorithm spiked due to less blocks in chain than calculations are expecting. So, no rush


[14-Dec-20 01:45 PM] Biz#0842
Oh, you‚Äôll need some testnet blur too. Drop your address here once you get around to things later on


[17-Dec-20 12:38 PM] Descartes#5580
any motion lately?


[17-Dec-20 02:48 PM] Biz#0842
Yeah, testing actively now. Been pushing out commits every day for last 11 days or so


[17-Dec-20 02:53 PM] Biz#0842
@daemonfox sent 100 testnet BLUR to your address


[17-Dec-20 02:53 PM] Biz#0842
@Descartes have had 33 nota cycles completed on relaunched testnet chain


[17-Dec-20 02:54 PM] Biz#0842
was running into some issues with the new mempool rules, but think I got the primary issue ironed out yesterday. just updated my seed nodes and am mining/notarizing atm

Will be modifying consensus code slightly tonight, and we‚Äôll plan on a new round of testing tomorrow.

Also, this change won‚Äôt require a relaunch of Testnet or anything. But will resolve the case of conflicting checkpoints.


[05-Jan-21 11:47 AM] Biz#0842
@daemonfox You free for a new build test tomorrow? My schedule got shifted back another day


[05-Jan-21 11:54 AM] daemonfox#6136
Should be

as long as a static IP isnt needed

Don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll need a static IP yet, as we are just testing BLUR-side things. Not required for blur. Just iguana I believe

Just an update that we will likely begin testing tomorrow. I began work on things today, but found an issue in our explorer that needed resolved. As such, just getting around to the consensus changes now


[06-Jan-21 03:56 PM] Biz#0842
Might be ready for multi-party testing tonight, but it‚Äôs doubtful. I will need to test things out independently first


[07-Jan-21 03:32 PM] Biz#0842
@daemonfox will be testing in about 30-45 minutes, if you want to join. Debugging some stuff, so not necessary to join however.


[07-Jan-21 03:32 PM] daemonfox#6136
I'll give it a go


[07-Jan-21 03:32 PM] Biz#0842
Cool. Will let you know once things are up and running. Issue I am running into is that first set of conflicting checkpoints aren‚Äôt reconciling themselves as they should


[07-Jan-21 03:33 PM] Biz#0842

@Tylor zkFS lmk if you wanna get your keys set up at some point


[07-Jan-21 03:40 PM] Biz#0842
Just made last commit prior to testing, so feel free to compile whenever


[07-Jan-21 03:41 PM] Biz#0842
Testnet chain was relaunched a couple weeks back. So may need to resync from scratch


[07-Jan-21 04:17 PM] Biz#0842
@daemonfox up and üèÉ


[07-Jan-21 05:13 PM] daemonfox#6136
Ok be on soon


[07-Jan-21 07:11 PM] Biz#0842
All good. Things still cycling atm


[07-Jan-21 07:12 PM] Biz#0842
Edge case is kinda hard to trigger since two nodes need to mine different nota blocks simultaneously. If it doesn‚Äôt happen overnight, I‚Äôll write some code to do it more quickly


[07-Jan-21 07:56 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
my schedule fills up this time of year - be back in April - CG is your best best


[08-Jan-21 06:04 AM] Biz#0842
CG does not appear to actually want access to chat in this channel. DMed him about it, no response


[08-Jan-21 06:05 AM] Biz#0842
It‚Äôs all good. Left things in cycle through the night. Will check how things went momentarily


[08-Jan-21 07:29 AM] Biz#0842
Nice. Bug was triggered overnight


[08-Jan-21 09:22 AM] daemonfox#6136
Hmmmm.... followed steps from last time to start the chain fresh...


[08-Jan-21 09:22 AM] daemonfox#6136
wallet says I still have coins...


[08-Jan-21 09:23 AM] Biz#0842
I sent you some


[08-Jan-21 09:24 AM] Biz#0842
checked message history here, so that you'd be all set. I did pause testing while I debug.


[08-Jan-21 09:24 AM] Biz#0842
Don't want the bug to get drowned out in logging


[08-Jan-21 09:24 AM] Biz#0842
will be making necessary changes after i eat some lunch, and will spin em all back up


[08-Jan-21 09:25 AM] daemonfox#6136
gotcha


[08-Jan-21 09:25 AM] daemonfox#6136
thats why im block 1/1 on new testnet lol


[08-Jan-21 09:25 AM] daemonfox#6136
ill cut them off for now but im ready when you are


[08-Jan-21 09:25 AM] Biz#0842
cool. i've currently got nodes in disagreement about notarized chain, so once that's debugged and i roll things back, you'll sync up


[08-Jan-21 09:26 AM] daemonfox#6136
Just @ me ill start it up again


[08-Jan-21 09:26 AM] Biz#0842
sure thing


[08-Jan-21 10:40 AM] Biz#0842
@daemonfox back up and running. pulled the logs I needed for now


[08-Jan-21 10:47 AM] daemonfox#6136
```./blurd --testnet --p2p-bind-port=11111 --add-peer=149.56.13.160
```


[08-Jan-21 10:47 AM] daemonfox#6136
Still good?


[08-Jan-21 11:51 AM] Biz#0842
Yeah, that should work. Feel free to add `--detach` to fork to background, if you like.


[08-Jan-21 11:51 AM] Biz#0842
Logs can be found in `~/.blurnetwork/testnet/blurnetwork.log` if you choose to do so


[08-Jan-21 12:32 PM] Biz#0842
@daemonfox going to let things keep rolling, but also updating my nodes with latest commit. Believe I found the way to squash the forking bug


[08-Jan-21 12:32 PM] Biz#0842
Feel free to pull in latest commit, if you like


[08-Jan-21 12:59 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok will do


[08-Jan-21 12:59 PM] daemonfox#6136
chain just got up to height


[08-Jan-21 12:59 PM] daemonfox#6136
```

[08-Jan-21 01:15 PM] daemonfox#6136
Will every 27 blocks be auto nota?


[08-Jan-21 01:15 PM] daemonfox#6136
so 7535 is next?


[08-Jan-21 01:16 PM] daemonfox#6136
7481, 7508,7535?


[08-Jan-21 01:21 PM] Biz#0842
26 minumum, sometimes it occurs a couple blocks later


[08-Jan-21 01:21 PM] Biz#0842
depending on how quickly blocks are rolling in, relative to nota process


[08-Jan-21 01:22 PM] Biz#0842
if blocks are rolling in at 1 minute or greater, and nota window substantially exceeds 30, it's likely something has gone wrong


[08-Jan-21 01:23 PM] Biz#0842
`7537` was last nota height, just now

You can also fetch a list of all notarization txs posted to blockchain with `curl -X POST http://localhost:21111/get_notarizations`.  Pipe that to a file though, it includes full tx blobs in hex, which are ~52kb each

[08-Jan-21 02:09 PM] Biz#0842
This one is occurring because pending nota txs are being factored into `update_pool_state` i believe.  It's a null effect, either way, but will be cleaned up eventually


[08-Jan-21 02:09 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok


[08-Jan-21 02:09 PM] Biz#0842
And yeah! feel free to mine. That's okay to do while this is all going on.


[08-Jan-21 02:10 PM] Biz#0842
been mining to my nota wallets also


[08-Jan-21 02:12 PM] Biz#0842
keep mining if ya like. I'll be observing as things cycle. Appears the latest commit may have resolved the issue we were running into previously.  `NOTARIZED_PREVHEIGHT` is considered the *final* notarization. Does that match KMD behaviors, to your knowledge?


[08-Jan-21 02:16 PM] Biz#0842
seems necessary to me, to reconcile possibly valid reorgs


[08-Jan-21 02:18 PM] Biz#0842
So far, no issues on my end. Let me know if you drift out of sync. I‚Äôll be integrating this stuff into an explorer soon so that these things are easier to check


[08-Jan-21 03:57 PM] daemonfox#6136
yes as far as I know


[08-Jan-21 03:57 PM] daemonfox#6136
things watch the prev best nota until the next nota cycle and then repeat

logging gets a little crowded on `log-level=1`


[08-Jan-21 08:28 PM] Biz#0842
looks like things working well. That is the buggy case being progressed through, so successful changes it seems


[08-Jan-21 08:30 PM] daemonfox#6136

[08-Jan-21 08:30 PM] daemonfox#6136

[08-Jan-21 08:30 PM] daemonfox#6136
Does this mean we should be able to nota ANY crptonote variant going forward?


[08-Jan-21 08:46 PM] Biz#0842
With this same mechanism, yep. And can use your derived CN keys across those forks


[09-Jan-21 09:32 AM] Biz#0842
Had a single node drift out of sync overnight. Happened in a way I‚Äôve not seen before, so appears one bug squashed and a smaller one appeared

@daemonfox hows state of your node/wallet?


[09-Jan-21 09:36 AM] daemonfox#6136

no worries. I‚Äôm writing some code to fix issue on that one node in mean time


[09-Jan-21 05:36 PM] daemonfox#6136
it all appears to be working... I have mined rewards and I see nota rewards sprikled in too


[10-Jan-21 09:55 AM] Biz#0842
Nice. Yeah, things still in cycle as of this morning for me


[12-Jan-21 08:53 PM] Biz#0842
So, blur side checkpointing still going strong. Appears we got a functioning nota scheme on blur. 

I have some other changes I need to make to the blur code (not big ones - backbone is already all there).. but I think next item of dev work will be turning attention back to `blur-api-cpp` for the last bit of iguana compat.

If we want to scale up testing first, we can do that as well. But would need to recruit participants @daemonfox


[12-Jan-21 09:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
Word.


[12-Jan-21 09:17 PM] daemonfox#6136

[12-Jan-21 10:55 PM] Biz#0842
Cool. Will do so tomorrow


[13-Jan-21 04:40 PM] daemonfox#6136
Who all is driving this effort?


[13-Jan-21 04:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
is JL or ca333 backing this or the KMD bounty system?


[13-Jan-21 04:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
I only ask so we can consider encouraging testers to come to the table as we approach season 5 notary voting


[13-Jan-21 04:42 PM] daemonfox#6136

[13-Jan-21 07:24 PM] Mylo#8306
how long does it take to setup?


[14-Jan-21 05:47 AM] Biz#0842
@Mylo not very long, just a matter of generating your keys for XMR. Once those are generated, you‚Äôll have them for all future XMR forks, too.


[14-Jan-21 05:48 AM] Biz#0842
I‚Äôm not sure. I was told by jl777 that in exchange for the work, KMD would provide support for notarizations to KMD/BTC. Ca333 said he would honor that arrangement


[14-Jan-21 05:52 AM] Biz#0842
If you have ideas for how to incentivize this stuff, open to hear them. I had planned on leaving those logistics up to jl777 or ca333

@daemonfox looks like we finally hit a bug around block 14200. Nice 10-11 days worth of notas, though from the looks of it. I‚Äôm going to dig in and figure out what went wrong. Nodes will be powered off while I do so


[15-Jan-21 10:29 AM] Biz#0842
387 notarizations completed, prior to stalling


[15-Jan-21 10:33 AM] Biz#0842
Only had one node out of my cluster fall out of sync, so not immediately apparent what the issue is. 

Could you post the output of `curl -X POST http://local host:21111/json_rpc -d ‚Äò{‚Äúmethod‚Äù:‚Äùget_notarization_data‚Äù}‚Äô` here when you get a chance?

My VM was off last few days


[15-Jan-21 10:37 AM] daemonfox#6136
But I'll pull what I can


[15-Jan-21 01:28 PM] Biz#0842
Nota nodes are back up on my end, and in cycle. Found what caused the stall. I doubt it will happen if we have more nodes active, but a case we should probably account for either way


[15-Jan-21 01:29 PM] Biz#0842
Need a uniform way to eliminate duplicate ntz sig requests. (I.e. two pending ntzs with conflicting signer indices). Easiest way to do this would be to give preference to lower index values, but that‚Äôs hardly fair to whoever holds #64 for example


[15-Jan-21 01:30 PM] Biz#0842
Will brainstorm some ways to solve this. If it‚Äôs too difficult we may just need to rely on redundancy being fine


[15-Jan-21 01:30 PM] Biz#0842
13/64 would result in this never happening, in reality, I‚Äôd bet


[15-Jan-21 01:49 PM] Biz#0842
Maybe we could hash each entry, and give preference to the numerically lower resulting hash value


[15-Jan-21 01:49 PM] Biz#0842
Similar to PoW hashing


[15-Jan-21 01:49 PM] Biz#0842
That will work


[15-Jan-21 04:23 PM] Biz#0842
@daemonfox halting testing until tomorrow

Going to enjoy my Friday and get back at it then


[15-Jan-21 04:25 PM] Biz#0842
Will be implementing the changes I mentioned above, then


[15-Jan-21 04:28 PM] daemonfox#6136
word. tell me when it is ready to pull and i will fire it back up


[15-Jan-21 05:13 PM] Biz#0842
Sure thing

Thanks for help, as always


[16-Jan-21 04:02 PM] Biz#0842
Started work on this today. Taking a little longer than I thought it would. But, adding a `cleanup_ntzpool` function to find and remove duplicates based on sigs count, by comparing first 6 characters of Tx hash values


[16-Jan-21 04:02 PM] Biz#0842
Should be enough to avoid collisions between that portion of two given hashes, I think


[16-Jan-21 04:03 PM] Biz#0842
Don‚Äôt want to waste compute comparing two very large numbers


[18-Jan-21 12:01 PM] Biz#0842
@daemonfox actively testing as I‚Äôm committing code currently. Feel free to spin up at your leisure


[18-Jan-21 12:02 PM] Biz#0842
Things under observation and cycling atm


[18-Jan-21 12:57 PM] Biz#0842
After discussing with our committee, it seems the best way to incentivize proper nota behavior is to allocate 2x block rewards for nota blocks. 

The excess reward will get paid to notarizing nodes who sign a given nota. Miner reward will remain 1x, so as not to disincentivize mining of notarizing blocks.


[18-Jan-21 12:58 PM] Biz#0842
Also mulling over some ways to do an incentivized testnet, but will speak with ca333 about elections and how that can be leveraged


[18-Jan-21 01:08 PM] daemonfox#6136
Pay per Nota has been my ideal method since joining LABS notaries


[18-Jan-21 03:01 PM] Biz#0842
Definitely my thoughts, as well. Primary concern was disincentivizing miners for those blocks. Doubling block reward should help to preserve existing motivations, though


[18-Jan-21 03:01 PM] Biz#0842
Also, that duplicate `sig_count` handling has now been implemented and is testing functionally


[18-Jan-21 03:02 PM] Biz#0842
(I.e. `cleanup_ntzpool()`)


[18-Jan-21 04:54 PM] Biz#0842
FYI nodes are down while I update them for the next couple hrs


[19-Jan-21 10:57 AM] Biz#0842
Didn‚Äôt get around to updating last night. Will be doing so in the next hour or two

@daemonfox we‚Äôre back up and running


[19-Jan-21 01:25 PM] Biz#0842
Be sure to pull in latest commits, when restarting


[19-Jan-21 01:25 PM] Biz#0842
Made some ntzpool consensus changes.


[19-Jan-21 03:09 PM] Biz#0842
Things seem to be happily behaving with those latest changes


[19-Jan-21 04:23 PM] Biz#0842

Cool. I‚Äôll fire mine back up and we‚Äôll see how things go


[19-Jan-21 08:34 PM] Biz#0842
Hit some issues when I was testing earlier but might have been due to smaller number of nodes.

Back up. Nodes were down prior


[19-Jan-21 08:36 PM] Biz#0842
Give it another shot


[19-Jan-21 08:42 PM] Biz#0842
Ah. I‚Äôm getting irregular behavior. Will need to troubleshoot tomorrow @daemonfox


[19-Jan-21 08:42 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok


[19-Jan-21 08:42 PM] daemonfox#6136
see you tomorrow


[19-Jan-21 08:42 PM] Biz#0842
Too late here. Yeah, will catch you tomorrow. Will jump on this first thing


[20-Jan-21 01:01 PM] Biz#0842
Up and running with latest changes. Looks to be that irregular behavior is remedied. You‚Äôll see quite a few yellow `WARNS` but as long as they aren‚Äôt red, it‚Äôs not a problem. 

Just put them as warnings to observe latest code behavior


[20-Jan-21 01:01 PM] Biz#0842
I did push a commit today, so, be sure to pull that in when you fire things up

Ah, so you need to roll back your blockchain. You can do this with `./blur-blockchain-import --pop-blocks=500 --testnet`


[20-Jan-21 01:21 PM] Biz#0842
That should do it. But just run it again if you are still getting blocked messages


[20-Jan-21 01:21 PM] Biz#0842
There was an issue that occurred prior to these commits, and I had to do the same on my nodes


[20-Jan-21 01:22 PM] Biz#0842
Also `rm ~/.blurnetwork/testnet/peers_state.bin` prior to relaunch


[20-Jan-21 01:23 PM] Biz#0842
Actually, would recommend just popping 1000 blocks to be safe. I‚Äôm not sure where the disagreement happened but feel like it was around `18793`

Sweet. I expect this round of testing to go smoothly. Hopefully not jinxing it


[20-Jan-21 01:32 PM] Biz#0842
Added a lot of edge case handling


[20-Jan-21 01:43 PM] Biz#0842
Hmm looks like previous nota tx didn‚Äôt get cleaned from one (or a few) mempools. Those `WARN`s about failing validation are due to this. Tx being re-broadcast is already in blockchain. 

Shouldn‚Äôt interfere but it‚Äôs awfully spammy


[20-Jan-21 01:45 PM] Biz#0842
Hmm. Interesting. Had two nodes fall out of sync, and go off on their own.


[20-Jan-21 01:48 PM] Biz#0842
Going to power those two down and let things keep running. @daemonfox let me know if you notice your node blocking more hosts

I am seeing some successful reorganizations, but unsure why reorganizations arent happening in that single case

That‚Äôs okay. That‚Äôs one of the nodes I just shut off


[20-Jan-21 01:50 PM] daemonfox#6136
k


[20-Jan-21 01:52 PM] daemonfox#6136
There it goes, seems fine


[20-Jan-21 01:54 PM] Biz#0842
Yeah. Something happening with excess txs when a lot of nodes sign off on the final signature


[20-Jan-21 01:55 PM] Biz#0842
Looks like we need to uniformly handle duplicates here, same as ntzpool


[20-Jan-21 01:55 PM] Biz#0842
Solution needed, as that will only get worse with 13/64


[20-Jan-21 01:55 PM] daemonfox#6136
are the extras being spent or just not timing out of the mempool properly?


[20-Jan-21 01:56 PM] Biz#0842
Not timing out of mempool properly. I think if I move the new validation code to after `already_have` check in mempool, that it might resolve the issue


[20-Jan-21 01:56 PM] daemonfox#6136
Should be able to cross reference that same thing in the current iguana code no?


[20-Jan-21 01:57 PM] daemonfox#6136
if its just a step out of order


[20-Jan-21 01:57 PM] Biz#0842
Iguana uses `nanomsg` for this stuff, so code is quite different


[20-Jan-21 01:57 PM] daemonfox#6136
got it


[20-Jan-21 01:57 PM] Biz#0842
All of this logic was written custom for BLUR


[20-Jan-21 01:58 PM] daemonfox#6136
its all in the blur notary daemon?


[20-Jan-21 01:58 PM] Biz#0842
Between consensus and notary wallet, yes. They‚Äôre separate, so consensus doesn‚Äôt apply to notary wallet


[20-Jan-21 01:58 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok i think i have it


[20-Jan-21 01:58 PM] Biz#0842
Daemon handles consensus stuff. Notary wallets are largely oblivious to thins that happen in core


[20-Jan-21 01:59 PM] daemonfox#6136
wallet daemon makes consensus and the notary daemon supplies the info and tracking o build the notarizations?


[20-Jan-21 02:01 PM] daemonfox#6136
Seems to run pretty light right now as well.


[20-Jan-21 02:01 PM] daemonfox#6136
3P iguana is over 240MB alone


[20-Jan-21 02:01 PM] daemonfox#6136
This blur VM is only hitting 275MB ram now max


[20-Jan-21 02:05 PM] Biz#0842
Nice. Yeah, I can run it with 2Gb of memory while I‚Äôm mining on my small VPSes


[20-Jan-21 02:05 PM] Biz#0842
So, very light overhead


[20-Jan-21 02:06 PM] Biz#0842
Will answer consensus stuff when I‚Äôm home in 5


[20-Jan-21 02:19 PM] Biz#0842
Okay, so in XMR world, "daemon" and "wallet" are separate.  'wallet daemon' isn't incorrect, but for avoidance of confusion, probably best to refer to it simply as the notary wallet.  

Daemon is where mempool, core , blockchain (primary location for consensus), and database `classes` reside.  Notary wallet does not have direct access to any of these, nor the p2p layer.  Any time wallet needs these values, they're all accessed through `blurd` RPC invocations. 

With that said, `blur-notary-server` is effectively a cloned `blur-wallet-rpc`, but with authentication for notarization tx creation, and custom logic for these transaction formats. So, this is what I mean when I say notary wallets are largely oblivious to whats actually going on the daemon.  Outside of querying over RPC, they don't communicate much


[20-Jan-21 02:22 PM] Biz#0842
there is an underlying `wallet2` class, which is used both in RPC and CLI wallets.  that class is the one that interfaces between core code and wallet UI


[20-Jan-21 02:23 PM] Biz#0842
`blur-notary-server` is just responsible for performing operations on data fetched from core.  it then sends it to `wallet2` which can communicate with the network through `core_rpc_server`.

Testing apears to be going smoothly, on a separate note.  I'll work on handling the node confusion tonight

no worries. I am writing code and stuff too


[20-Jan-21 03:14 PM] daemonfox#6136
This almost sounds like using nSPV to make notary transactions


[20-Jan-21 03:19 PM] Biz#0842
Not quite, but there are similarities. You‚Äôre right about that


[20-Jan-21 04:20 PM] Biz#0842
@daemonfox feel free to power down until tomorrow.  Hit the bug on other nodes, and need to write some code to fix

Good to power things up. Have done a number of cycles now, and things all running smoothly. Reorganizations happening properly now, forks reconciling themselves


[21-Jan-21 02:40 PM] Biz#0842
If you decide to mine as well, please keep your threads low. 

Diff at 4k currently, and don‚Äôt want it ramping back up too fast. Helpful to be able to stress test fast block generation at lower diffs

Ok will.do shortly


[21-Jan-21 03:03 PM] Biz#0842

[05-Feb-21 02:55 PM] daemonfox#6136
Sure


[09-Feb-21 04:23 AM] Biz#0842
@daemonfox just an update on where things stand: relatively successful round of independent testing. 

I did find an edge case, where nota wallets are skipping a cycle if they begin nota tx creation prior to a nota block being mined... but finish it after the nota block has been mined. This is an error in the logic I wrote.

However, I think it is a best to wait to fix it, until I write the code for conversion of full ntzpool to txpool. Currently, only the last ntzpool transaction is included in a nota block. That change will require a relaunch of testnet, so best to address both at once. I will be doing this, this week

No need for help testing for now. With more nodes, this error wouldn‚Äôt matter.


[09-Feb-21 09:32 AM] Biz#0842
Will update once that code is written


[11-Feb-21 08:10 PM] Biz#0842
Will have next iteration with new ntzpool/txpool mechanics complete tomorrow. Testnet will be rewound & relaunched tm morning, as well @daemonfox


[12-Feb-21 06:06 AM] daemonfox#6136
sounds good


[12-Feb-21 06:07 AM] daemonfox#6136
I did more VM cleanup and only have 1 running on my dev box now


[12-Feb-21 06:07 AM] daemonfox#6136
so I can start a few more


[12-Feb-21 07:56 AM] Biz#0842
Okay cool. Will keep you abreast of work completed today. Got a little bit of a late start this morn due to recovering an injury. but still expect to get same volume of work done today. A couple extra VMs will help with scaled up testing


[12-Feb-21 09:44 AM] Biz#0842
Testnet has been rolled back to `height = 64`. Doing some preliminary testing to verify desired behaviors are occurring


[12-Feb-21 09:59 AM] Biz#0842
@daemonfox please post your address here when you get a chance so I can fund it

Current node address


[12-Feb-21 02:29 PM] Biz#0842
Cool. Sending over momentarily. Just about finished coding up these new mechanics


[12-Feb-21 02:29 PM] Biz#0842
Needed to do a bit of refactoring to get things to do what they needed to


[12-Feb-21 02:30 PM] Biz#0842
But testing all so far successful.


[12-Feb-21 03:24 PM] Biz#0842
@daemonfox just sent you 200 testnet BLUR in 4 transfers of 50


[12-Feb-21 04:43 PM] Biz#0842
Alright, first iteration of that code is done, and working.

I won‚Äôt get around to updating my nodes until tomorrow though. But things are working with code I‚Äôve added today.


[12-Feb-21 04:45 PM] Biz#0842
If you do fire things up to test them out, you‚Äôll see in `get_notarization_data` response, multiples of 5 in `notarizations_complete`. That‚Äôs because this is counting total nota txs, which are now equal to `DPOW_SIG_COUNT` for each nota block.


[12-Feb-21 04:46 PM] Biz#0842
So that will need changed. But going to address that stuff tomorrow, along with expanding validation in the `convert_ntzpool_to_Txpool` function.


[12-Feb-21 04:47 PM] Biz#0842
We should be ready for testing without those changes, first thing tomo though @daemonfox


[12-Feb-21 04:48 PM] Biz#0842
None of the stuff I mentioned above will affect consensus or anything, so we‚Äôre a go for tests

Concepts to adapt


[12-Feb-21 04:50 PM] Biz#0842
That just gave me some ideas for some blurry Komodos in future art to accompany announcements


[12-Feb-21 04:50 PM] daemonfox#6136
She is also making her own attempts at komodos

Haha nice! üëçüèª


[13-Feb-21 11:11 AM] Biz#0842
@daemonfox free for some testing in an hour or so? Updating my nodes atm


[13-Feb-21 11:47 AM] daemonfox#6136
will be a couple hours... pppl over at the moment


[13-Feb-21 01:08 PM] Biz#0842
all good man. Found out I gotta resolve some stuff first


[13-Feb-21 01:13 PM] Biz#0842
Resolved but gotta update my nodes again. So you got plenty of time


[14-Feb-21 10:22 AM] Biz#0842
Thiiiink I finally got things worked out last night. But will do some testing today and let you know if we are green lit


[14-Feb-21 12:18 PM] Biz#0842
@daemonfox yep, things working and have them in-cycle now. So we are a ‚Äúgo‚Äù for some tests


[14-Feb-21 12:35 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok cool


[14-Feb-21 12:35 PM] daemonfox#6136
im a bit drunk but fuck it lol


[14-Feb-21 12:44 PM] Biz#0842
If you want to wait until tomorrow we can do that. I can keep tuning things


[14-Feb-21 12:45 PM] Biz#0842
I‚Äôm just about to update my nodes once more to resolve one edge case I just patched


[14-Feb-21 12:45 PM] Biz#0842
Expect things to run rather smoothly once thats done, however.


[14-Feb-21 12:46 PM] Biz#0842
Totally up to you. Ill be spinning things back up in about an hour


[14-Feb-21 12:52 PM] daemonfox#6136
building


[14-Feb-21 12:52 PM] daemonfox#6136
i love drunk testing


[14-Feb-21 12:53 PM] daemonfox#6136
I earned my first JL bounty pretty wasted just trying weird things


[14-Feb-21 01:07 PM] Biz#0842
My bad on the false start haha. But yeah, current source is all good. I just gotta update these nodes, which is tedious AF each time I have to do it


[14-Feb-21 01:07 PM] Biz#0842
But cool. I‚Äôm getting things upped now


[14-Feb-21 01:29 PM] Biz#0842
Alright we‚Äôre off and running üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


[14-Feb-21 02:00 PM] Biz#0842
Just updated source one last time. Grabbing a drink as well üçª


[14-Feb-21 02:08 PM] Biz#0842
Gah. Gotta update again. Maybe best to push this off til tomorrow after all. Need to keep tuning this a bit more. Don‚Äôt wanna keep stringing you along when I run into an issue here or there


[14-Feb-21 02:08 PM] Biz#0842
I will ping you once I get this stable. Will take me an hour or two likely


[14-Feb-21 02:56 PM] Biz#0842
Looks like we‚Äôre stable after the last one! W00t


[14-Feb-21 04:16 PM] daemonfox#6136
Good... building...


[15-Feb-21 05:52 AM] daemonfox#6136
seems things are ok?


[15-Feb-21 05:52 AM] daemonfox#6136
Looks ok... kept going while I slept


[15-Feb-21 05:52 AM] daemonfox#6136
couple of errors where it looks like the daemon timed out


[15-Feb-21 05:53 AM] daemonfox#6136
But thats prob my fault this machine is also VRSC mining


[15-Feb-21 10:03 AM] Biz#0842
I shut things down earlier this morning. Things did stop at nota count 41 I believe.


[15-Feb-21 10:04 AM] Biz#0842
I‚Äôll update my nodes today and we‚Äôll give it another go. Stability for sure improving, however


[15-Feb-21 10:04 AM] Biz#0842
I patched that nota cycle skipping behavior, but that update didn‚Äôt make it into the last batch


[15-Feb-21 10:04 AM] Biz#0842
So expect stability to improve even further once that change is in


[15-Feb-21 10:05 AM] Biz#0842
Gonna torque up the mining power a bit too so we can knock out notas at a quicker clip


[15-Feb-21 11:22 AM] Biz#0842
@daemonfox recompiling & updating my nodes now, so will be spinning things back up in about 30 mins


[15-Feb-21 11:22 AM] daemonfox#6136
ok


[15-Feb-21 11:47 AM] Biz#0842
Got nodes back in cycle now


[15-Feb-21 01:39 PM] Biz#0842
Just shut things down to make a few changes


[15-Feb-21 04:29 PM] Biz#0842
You‚Äôll need to remove your data directory next time you power up `blurd`. Introduced a consensus change a couple commits ago. Will fund your addy again shortly


[15-Feb-21 04:30 PM] Biz#0842
Rolled back and relaunched testnet as a result


[15-Feb-21 04:31 PM] Biz#0842
That should be the last consensus-breaking change, prior to prod


[15-Feb-21 04:31 PM] Biz#0842
Well, excluding KMD or BTC chain data referencing


[15-Feb-21 04:59 PM] Biz#0842
funded yo addy


[15-Feb-21 04:59 PM] Biz#0842
we're off n rollin again. things seem very stable this time. but will keep eye on things


[15-Feb-21 05:00 PM] Biz#0842
also got rid of extraneous errors that were popping up


[15-Feb-21 05:11 PM] daemonfox#6136
lol your roll back tool is intense


[15-Feb-21 05:12 PM] daemonfox#6136
I rolled back in a couple batches


[15-Feb-21 05:12 PM] daemonfox#6136
to block 0


[15-Feb-21 05:12 PM] daemonfox#6136
and started it and it synced to you


[15-Feb-21 05:12 PM] daemonfox#6136
1109 blocks?


[15-Feb-21 05:12 PM] Biz#0842
yeah, you can just remove whole data directory next time, if ya like


[15-Feb-21 05:12 PM] daemonfox#6136
trying not to lose this wallet


[15-Feb-21 05:12 PM] Biz#0842
but yep, that's correct. my nodes blocked your IP almost immediately but just unblocked ya


[15-Feb-21 05:12 PM] Biz#0842
oh, wallet doesn't save in data directory


[15-Feb-21 05:12 PM] Biz#0842
saves in active binary dir


[15-Feb-21 05:13 PM] Biz#0842
different from BTC-like code in that regard


[15-Feb-21 05:13 PM] daemonfox#6136
ah thats right


[15-Feb-21 05:13 PM] daemonfox#6136
and i do have a BU


[15-Feb-21 05:13 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok everything is up


[15-Feb-21 05:14 PM] Biz#0842
cool. for some reason, a block snuck in with less than 5 nota txs in block. but going to keep things running. we're stable aside from that. so we'll have to rollback again at some point, cause that shouldn't happen


[15-Feb-21 05:15 PM] Biz#0842
but good for now, anyway


[15-Feb-21 05:15 PM] Biz#0842
your `get_notarization_data` will show count for total nota txs in blockchain, FYI


[15-Feb-21 05:15 PM] Biz#0842
not notarized blocks count


[15-Feb-21 05:16 PM] Biz#0842
we were losing info on the dividing by `DPOW_SIG_COUNT`, so changed that bit back today so i can debug a bit easier


[15-Feb-21 05:17 PM] Biz#0842
let me know if ya run into any issues as things are humming along


[15-Feb-21 05:22 PM] Biz#0842
occurred at `height = 1084` from looks of my wallet. just writing here so I don't forget


[16-Feb-21 09:45 AM] Biz#0842
So, things ran smoothly through the night. Will be addressing the issue i mentioned above, later on this afternoon. Will also be adding some functionality to ensure consistency across ntzpool conversion.


[16-Feb-21 01:51 PM] Biz#0842
@daemonfox seeing your node pop up on my peerlists just now. I fixed that case where nota block with too few ntz_txs made it into blockchain. Roll back to height `1060` or so, to sync up


[16-Feb-21 01:52 PM] Biz#0842
should be stable and without issue from here on out, methinks

current height is `1122`. let things run to 2446 between last night, and this morn. but had to roll back since last consensus change I added wasn't triggering properly


[16-Feb-21 01:54 PM] Biz#0842
'tis fixed now.  let me know if you need more BLUR coins though

live reorg


[16-Feb-21 02:13 PM] Biz#0842
yeah, it's cause I've got a total of 8 nodes mining simultaneously


[16-Feb-21 02:14 PM] Biz#0842
difficulty is very low, hasn't caught up to block rate yet. so lotsa blocks being found by diff nodes


[16-Feb-21 02:16 PM] Biz#0842
our target time is 1 minute, so things should mellow out. v11 difficulty adjustment algo takes a rolling window of `720` blocks. as a result, things still behaving a little screwy since i rolled back and timestamp gap


[16-Feb-21 02:16 PM] Biz#0842
but performing pretty good under stress of block rate

[16-Feb-21 02:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
case handled


[16-Feb-21 02:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
but why does it even allow it to get to that step


[16-Feb-21 02:18 PM] daemonfox#6136
is it a time out?


[16-Feb-21 02:18 PM] daemonfox#6136
gotta have all for that specific round by X time or dump?


[16-Feb-21 02:19 PM] Biz#0842
Think it's just happening due to some nodes not receiving protocol relays.  `ntzpool` converts once we hit threshold of `DPOW_SIG_COUNT` and then node relays whole `txpool`.  It looks like nodes are sometimes not receiving all of those `NOTIFY_NEW_TRANSACTION` messages, or they are finding a block before they're all added to pool.


[16-Feb-21 02:20 PM] daemonfox#6136
that last part


[16-Feb-21 02:20 PM] daemonfox#6136
chain moving too quick makes sense


[16-Feb-21 02:20 PM] daemonfox#6136
tx thinks it is in one block, was orphaned and is in a later


[16-Feb-21 02:20 PM] Biz#0842
makes sense to me


[16-Feb-21 02:21 PM] daemonfox#6136
We have this case in KMD notas sometimes


[16-Feb-21 02:21 PM] daemonfox#6136
a nodes wallet will think a consumed TX is still valid


[16-Feb-21 02:21 PM] Biz#0842
nice, cool to hear we are running on familiar ground


[16-Feb-21 02:25 PM] daemonfox#6136
there was a tattle tale mechanism designed that can decode the failed nota outputs, and from there you can see who of the 13 notas it may be,


[16-Feb-21 02:26 PM] Biz#0842
So, where you see `signers_index` field in the `ntzpool_tx_meta_t` structs, we could easily turn that into a similar thing.


[16-Feb-21 02:27 PM] daemonfox#6136
Im not familiar enough with CN consensus to know that impact


[16-Feb-21 02:28 PM] Biz#0842
when you say `failed nota outputs` can you explain a bit what that means?


[16-Feb-21 02:29 PM] daemonfox#6136
Iguana would dump a failed message into all of our stdout when a single tx in a round turned out to be spent beforehand


[16-Feb-21 02:29 PM] daemonfox#6136
and cycle to try again


[16-Feb-21 02:29 PM] daemonfox#6136
That output is encoded and has the 13 selected notaries and their tx info inside


[16-Feb-21 02:30 PM] Biz#0842
oh, I see. I was misunderstanding your meaning. for that to be possible here, we'd need to do backwards tracing to the STXO, and check with notary viewkey/spendkeys.  definitely possible though


[16-Feb-21 02:30 PM] daemonfox#6136
Decker found a novel way to quickly use that to see which mode had the issue

in your `blur-notary-server-rpc`, this line: 

```Derived pubkey = 5dd6b1de242b4f6c9ea3f50c8481be0cc4371f573bafa6e6ad3fa51fea6e3820, recv_outkey: 5dd6b1de242b4f6c9ea3f50c8481be0cc4371f573bafa6e6ad3fa51fea6e3820                                                                                                                                                                                                          
 for n = 64, and nn = 60```

is performing checking with private viewkey, and public spendkey


[16-Feb-21 02:32 PM] Biz#0842
Think same could be done if we knew which `output_idx` is being spent in blockchain


[16-Feb-21 02:33 PM] Biz#0842
obviously this info isn't immediately available in CN, but we could grab it from blockchain, knowing which UTXO is being sent to all notas. just need to hop back a step in graph


[16-Feb-21 02:34 PM] Biz#0842
I thought about this problem a bit earlier this week, since it would be helpful to discern for transparency's sake

er, 26 maybe. didn't roll back to genesis


[16-Feb-21 06:57 PM] Biz#0842
next step will be incorporating iguana once again to the process


[17-Feb-21 12:54 AM] phm87#7395
The labs change worked on my phm87_SH notary node but nota perfs decreased a lot, I should close this PR with a comment, ok for testing, ok for DEV nodes but not ok for normal NN


[17-Feb-21 04:29 AM] daemonfox#6136
agreed


[17-Feb-21 04:30 AM] daemonfox#6136
Was hoping it would at least show the issue we found enough biz could apply or augment for this if needed


[17-Feb-21 04:32 AM] phm87#7395
maybe the patch can help, I don't know


[17-Feb-21 07:42 AM] Biz#0842
I will have to look into it a bit more. I‚Äôm not very familiar with the functional part of intra-NN comms in iguana. Will get back with results once I do


[19-Feb-21 07:47 AM] daemonfox#6136
Cut off my node... more hardware arrived making some updates


[19-Feb-21 10:34 AM] Biz#0842
All good @daemonfox. I started up another to compensate


[19-Feb-21 03:31 PM] Biz#0842
Nodes off for a bit. Ran into some hardware issues on my local machine apparently


[20-Feb-21 11:44 AM] Biz#0842
Nodes are back up


[22-Feb-21 09:53 AM] Biz#0842
Seeing as we are stable for a handful of days now, this week I‚Äôll be turning my attention back to iguana/KMD communication through `blur-api-cpp`


[01-Mar-21 12:01 PM] Descartes#5580
What work is remaining for this, would you say?


[01-Mar-21 01:05 PM] Biz#0842
So, we've had successful testing the last 10 days or so. `633` notarization cycles have completed since we implemented those consensus changes.


[01-Mar-21 01:07 PM] Biz#0842
This week, work will be focused on finalizing the communications between BLUR<->KMD and adding bi-directional communication to `blur-api-cpp`, so that blur daemon can also communicate inbound with iguana.  Iguana is currently able to receive information from `blurd`.. but not in the other direction.   We only need a small amount of information from `iguana` for our network.  But that is the next step, and finishing up the tx mocking stuff for iguana.  Last progress made on that front, our tx info being fed to iguana was being treated as invalid.


[01-Mar-21 01:10 PM] Biz#0842
Those 633 cycles are a big step, since we're now stable for quite some time and things are behaving as they should. Since that base is covered, we've got a functioning checkpoint system.  So data being relayed to iguana will be properly valid, and able to be honored by our network.

We'll also be strengthening the validation around notarization txs on Blur-side.  Although, that's more fine-tuning, and i'm not sure how necessary that is.  Once the above is complete, testing scale up will be next order of business. I'm happy to provide some bounties in either BLUR or KMD to those who might be willing to help with the scaled up testing


[01-Mar-21 01:18 PM] Biz#0842
@daemonfox I'd like to feed messages from this channel into our home server. Any idea on the best way to do so?


[01-Mar-21 01:19 PM] Biz#0842
I'll do some research, but am thinking i'll need a webhook for this channel


[01-Mar-21 01:19 PM] daemonfox#6136
several of the KMD team have discord hooks to their channels


[01-Mar-21 01:20 PM] daemonfox#6136
Check with tokel and nutellalicka


[01-Mar-21 01:20 PM] daemonfox#6136
they JUST added theirs


[01-Mar-21 01:20 PM] Biz#0842
cool, thanks. the "who" was my follow-up


[01-Mar-21 01:20 PM] daemonfox#6136
always is


[01-Mar-21 01:20 PM] daemonfox#6136

[01-Mar-21 01:45 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
G'day @Biz , @sclear created the discord-bridge bot that I use. I am working with the KMD team at the moment to have it added to the KMD discord. @Audo and CA are chasing this up. I am waiting for @Audo to authorise the bot, so we can create the bridge between our server.


[01-Mar-21 01:53 PM] Biz#0842
Awesome, thanks! If possible, I‚Äôd like to tag onto that effort. Let me know if there‚Äôs any way I can help


[01-Mar-21 01:54 PM] daemonfox#6136
Love it when projects unexpectedly align in parallel!


[01-Mar-21 01:54 PM] daemonfox#6136
doubles the effectivity of things


[01-Mar-21 01:55 PM] Biz#0842
Haha, my thoughts exactly. @Descartes prodded me in our committee, and I thought to message here about it luckily. Lot of minds in synchronicity on this one


[01-Mar-21 01:57 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Sounds good. @sclear made it for free for people to use, so any contributions to their efforts would be welcomed. If you'd like to look at how the bridge works, check out the Tokel discord and the Sapphire bots discord. We currently have a link between the two.


[01-Mar-21 02:00 PM] Biz#0842
Where can I find links to these?


[01-Mar-21 02:07 PM] Biz#0842

will be resuming work on `iguana` <-> `blurd` comms, once my `komodod` finishes sycning these last 30k blocks


[02-Mar-21 12:48 PM] daemonfox#6136
word


[02-Mar-21 12:48 PM] daemonfox#6136
was just tinkering in my blur VM


[02-Mar-21 12:48 PM] daemonfox#6136
and downloaded komodod lol


[02-Mar-21 12:49 PM] daemonfox#6136
ill compile and bootstrap mine this week


[02-Mar-21 12:52 PM] Biz#0842
cool. sounds good. timing on that should be perfect. gotta re-familiarize myself with this a bit anyhow


[02-Mar-21 01:07 PM] Biz#0842
agh. komdod crashed and lost my sync progress. multitasking too hard for my vps


[02-Mar-21 01:08 PM] Biz#0842
maybe faster just to bootstrap than resync these remainin 88k blocks.


[02-Mar-21 03:43 PM] Biz#0842
managed to figure out what was slowing `blurd`'s sync speed so much. quite a bit faster now


[03-Mar-21 09:38 AM] Biz#0842
@daemonfox got iguana running again.  Let me know once you're set up


[03-Mar-21 09:38 AM] Biz#0842
if i recall correctly, i think we need 3 notaries online, yeah?


[03-Mar-21 09:41 AM] Biz#0842
I am going to look into how difficult it might be to add a `bool` condition to iguana for CN-compat, so we can skirt the tx creation logic.  That might be easier than trying to generate valid dummy secp256k1 points


[03-Mar-21 09:42 AM] Biz#0842
something like `if (cn_coin == true) { just notarize chain data }` in shorthand


[03-Mar-21 09:48 AM] daemonfox#6136
I'm not sure


[03-Mar-21 09:48 AM] daemonfox#6136
In KMD it's looking for 13 in daemon code


[03-Mar-21 09:49 AM] daemonfox#6136
In LABS it's set to 7


[03-Mar-21 09:50 AM] Biz#0842
I just lowered `minsigs` to 1. but I think Alright mentioned at one point that 3 NNs need to be connected for iguana to behave properly.


[03-Mar-21 09:50 AM] Biz#0842
i'll check my pms, thats where i think we talked about it


[03-Mar-21 09:50 AM] daemonfox#6136
Oh ok


[03-Mar-21 09:51 AM] daemonfox#6136
That makes sense, iguana between 2 nodes is not enough for consensus check by base math rules


[03-Mar-21 09:51 AM] daemonfox#6136
1 is not enough


[03-Mar-21 09:51 AM] daemonfox#6136
2 makes ties possible


[03-Mar-21 09:52 AM] daemonfox#6136
So next odd available is min 3


[03-Mar-21 09:53 AM] daemonfox#6136
With three online and minsig2, you can start.


[03-Mar-21 09:55 AM] Biz#0842
okay. so we'll need another. @Alright @TonyL, either of you available to help out in the next couple of days?


[03-Mar-21 09:55 AM] Biz#0842
if not, I can rent another VPS


[03-Mar-21 09:57 AM] Biz#0842
we'll also need to your pubkey to `3rd_party` config file here: 

```

[03-Mar-21 10:01 AM] Biz#0842
then i'm getting a curl error later on, so investigating that now


[03-Mar-21 10:09 AM] Biz#0842
looks like problem is in `listunspent` formatting maybe? 
```
BLUR null retstr from (1, 99999999, ["vry3MUT5tErwnjeDubjXv2BxzoyC8fPhxJ"])nnull return from dpow_listunspent
```


[03-Mar-21 10:24 AM] Biz#0842
Nah, issue is occurring elsewhere. Will keep digging


[03-Mar-21 11:00 AM] daemonfox#6136
Looks promising


[03-Mar-21 02:03 PM] Biz#0842
`listunspent` is now functioning. however, I'm getting crashes on `blur-api-cpp` which i've not seen occur prior to this week. unsure if its just my setup, or code-related. so give a holler when you're able to give things a try.


[03-Mar-21 02:04 PM] Biz#0842
methods that are triggering it seem to be quite random


[03-Mar-21 02:11 PM] daemonfox#6136
Will be back at pc soon


[03-Mar-21 02:12 PM] Biz#0842
all good, its no rush


[03-Mar-21 02:37 PM] Biz#0842

same behavior happening with different methods. suppose i'll try removing some methods and seeing if one is triggering the others to fail in a chain reaction


[03-Mar-21 02:44 PM] Biz#0842
gonna go take a break for a bit and reset

[04-Mar-21 05:55 AM] daemonfox#6136
funny stuff during my resync


[04-Mar-21 05:56 AM] Biz#0842
What‚Äôs occurring?


[04-Mar-21 05:57 AM] daemonfox#6136
It would throw a ton or errors notating sig count 1 or 2 and failed notarization... waterfall and then block some of your nodes


[04-Mar-21 05:57 AM] daemonfox#6136
within every few K blocks it would ban all of yours and id have to kill it


[04-Mar-21 05:57 AM] daemonfox#6136
and start it up again... was about 6 starts to get to height


[04-Mar-21 05:58 AM] Biz#0842
Ah, okay. I need to add some code to ignore those `ntz_sig` requests while syncing then


[04-Mar-21 05:58 AM] Biz#0842
Thanks for letting me know. That‚Äôs not intended behavior obviously


[04-Mar-21 05:59 AM] Biz#0842
I‚Äôll be able to work on this in about two hours. Got an appointment in an hour


[04-Mar-21 06:01 AM] Biz#0842

[04-Mar-21 10:13 AM] Biz#0842
Ah, crap. Sorry, thought I finished sending the message I meant to type here


[04-Mar-21 10:14 AM] Biz#0842
Took much longer than expected but I‚Äôm home now and booting things up


[04-Mar-21 10:19 AM] Biz#0842
Got a feeling the changes I made to core (since we forked off he dpow-blur repo in v1.9.8.1) will fix that syncing issue, so gonna merge those in shortly and test to be sure


[04-Mar-21 11:03 AM] Biz#0842
Case has been handled

alright, got things back up and running.  have you run `blur-api-cpp` previously? can't recall if the last time was just with Tony or not


[04-Mar-21 12:08 PM] Biz#0842
you'll need a running `iguana` and `komodod` to reproduce the crashes I was encountering.  Didn't see the same when manually calling methods with `curl`


[04-Mar-21 12:11 PM] Biz#0842
@daemonfox recommend compiling with debug info also when compiling `blur-api-cpp`, so you'll get some annotated stack traces on crash.


[04-Mar-21 12:12 PM] Biz#0842
(if they occur)

all good. i am drinking with family currently, so no immediate need. crash does seem resolved though. looks like iguana was making concurrent calls to `BlurAPI` class, which wasn't thread friendly

added a mutex to command-issuing function, and things stablized

[04-Mar-21 06:06 PM] daemonfox#6136
yeah going to compile it myself


[04-Mar-21 06:06 PM] Biz#0842
I assume you‚Äôre following `INSTRUCTIONS.md`?


[04-Mar-21 06:07 PM] daemonfox#6136
yes trying to

then the make command and its building


[04-Mar-21 06:14 PM] Biz#0842
so it's working now?


[04-Mar-21 06:14 PM] daemonfox#6136
yup done


[04-Mar-21 06:14 PM] daemonfox#6136
at least the build completed


[04-Mar-21 06:15 PM] Biz#0842
okay cool, so the build packages are incorrect on those instructions?

okay, gotcha


[04-Mar-21 06:18 PM] Biz#0842
thank you


[04-Mar-21 06:18 PM] daemonfox#6136
and then for this build of ubuntu 18.04 LTS server I had to do the extra


[04-Mar-21 06:19 PM] daemonfox#6136
```sudo apt remove libcurl4
sudo apt install libcurl4
sudo apt install curl
sudo apt install cmake```


[04-Mar-21 06:19 PM] daemonfox#6136
IDK why


[04-Mar-21 06:20 PM] Biz#0842
yeah, that's strange. maybe the libcurl part


[04-Mar-21 06:20 PM] Biz#0842
i'll check it out on a fresh install this weekend


[04-Mar-21 06:20 PM] daemonfox#6136
some posts talk about this being an issue in this version


[04-Mar-21 06:20 PM] daemonfox#6136
18 comes with libcurl4


[04-Mar-21 06:20 PM] daemonfox#6136
and some things specify stuff in libcurl3


[04-Mar-21 06:21 PM] daemonfox#6136
anyways


[04-Mar-21 06:21 PM] Biz#0842
okay. i'll dig into it and maybe need to provide separate directions


[04-Mar-21 06:21 PM] Biz#0842
I did update `INSTRUCTIONS.md` just now


[04-Mar-21 06:21 PM] daemonfox#6136
so also need your dpow right?


[04-Mar-21 06:21 PM] daemonfox#6136
ty!


[04-Mar-21 06:22 PM] Biz#0842
yes, total we need `dpow-blur`, `dPoW` (either komodo's or mine.. mine has correct config files), `blur-api-cpp`, and `komodod`


[04-Mar-21 06:22 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok on it


[04-Mar-21 06:22 PM] Biz#0842
I will also need you to PM me your new IP if thats changed since you updated your VM


[04-Mar-21 06:22 PM] daemonfox#6136
yes ill tie it to a static and DM it


[04-Mar-21 06:22 PM] Biz#0842
cool


[04-Mar-21 06:23 PM] Biz#0842
`blur-api-cpp` still happily operating, so looks like the concurrent calls were in fact the issue


[04-Mar-21 06:25 PM] daemonfox#6136
lol


[04-Mar-21 06:25 PM] daemonfox#6136
```sudo apt install build-essential cmake pkg-config libssl-dev libunwind-dev libevent-dev libsodium-dev binutils-dev libboost-all-dev autoconf libreadline-dev```


[04-Mar-21 06:25 PM] daemonfox#6136
some of the missing things are in the dpow build


[04-Mar-21 06:26 PM] Biz#0842
hahaha this explains it


[04-Mar-21 06:26 PM] Biz#0842
never hurts to have dups


[04-Mar-21 06:26 PM] Biz#0842
my bad on the oversight


[04-Mar-21 06:26 PM] daemonfox#6136
nah


[04-Mar-21 06:26 PM] daemonfox#6136
that is what this process is for


[04-Mar-21 06:26 PM] daemonfox#6136
shore up the little things


[04-Mar-21 06:26 PM] daemonfox#6136
streamline


[04-Mar-21 06:27 PM] Biz#0842
its helpful for sure


[04-Mar-21 06:27 PM] Biz#0842
FYI, you should expect `blur-api-cpp` and `iguana`'s cycles to progress only this far, and repeat:

```


[04-Mar-21 06:28 PM] Biz#0842
`listunspent` also gets called in that cycle, but looks like we aren't progressing past that spot. if we do in our tests, I'm just experiencing that bc we don't have more notas online


[04-Mar-21 06:28 PM] daemonfox#6136
seems the cmake thing is a major deal


[04-Mar-21 06:28 PM] daemonfox#6136
dpow needs the specific version and the cpp build doesnt


[04-Mar-21 06:29 PM] Biz#0842
yeah, its due to `libhydrogen`s `cmake` files


[04-Mar-21 06:29 PM] Biz#0842
they use CMake commands that are not present in <3.14


[04-Mar-21 06:29 PM] Biz#0842
i can probably find some ways around it


[04-Mar-21 06:30 PM] Biz#0842
but didn't want to monkey with a lib's build that we'll be using for crypto ops


[04-Mar-21 06:30 PM] daemonfox#6136
grabbing it now


[04-Mar-21 06:31 PM] Biz#0842
currently hydrogen is used for zeroing & seeding CN privkeys securely


[04-Mar-21 06:31 PM] Biz#0842
I *think* those are the only spots I used it at present


[04-Mar-21 06:32 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok, its building now


[04-Mar-21 06:32 PM] Biz#0842
cool


[04-Mar-21 06:34 PM] Biz#0842
FYI I will be in-and-out remainder of evening. so for pertinent things don't hesitate to spam my mentions


[04-Mar-21 06:35 PM] daemonfox#6136
aight


[04-Mar-21 06:35 PM] daemonfox#6136
ill have blur-dpow done soon


[04-Mar-21 06:35 PM] daemonfox#6136
then can get KMD and your dpow repo done after, those build quick


[04-Mar-21 06:36 PM] Biz#0842
you can use multiple threads on `dpow-blur` build. `blur-api-cpp` is the only one that doesn't handle `make -j$threads`


[04-Mar-21 06:37 PM] Biz#0842
will build pretty quick with `make -j4` but make sure you have significant memory available


[04-Mar-21 06:43 PM] daemonfox#6136
```git submodule update --init```


[04-Mar-21 06:44 PM] daemonfox#6136
had to run this after first dpow-blur build attempt


[04-Mar-21 06:44 PM] daemonfox#6136
```After installing the dependencies, clone this repo with:

git clone https://github.com/blur-network/dpow-blur.git

Cd into the proper directory, and then compile with:

cd dpow-blur
git submodule update --init
make release-static```


[04-Mar-21 06:46 PM] Biz#0842
ah, good catch


[04-Mar-21 06:47 PM] daemonfox#6136
63%


[04-Mar-21 06:48 PM] Biz#0842
added to compilation instructions


[04-Mar-21 06:48 PM] daemonfox#6136
ill be a full stack dev before i know it lmao


[04-Mar-21 06:49 PM] daemonfox#6136
at least you make this easy


[04-Mar-21 06:58 PM] Biz#0842
Haha just a few months of head down coding to get there. Oh, and staying at holiday inn express the night before


[04-Mar-21 06:58 PM] Biz#0842
That‚Äôs how I got here üòâ


[04-Mar-21 07:01 PM] daemonfox#6136
lmao


[04-Mar-21 07:01 PM] daemonfox#6136
100%!


[04-Mar-21 07:15 PM] daemonfox#6136
yikes more cmake trouble


[04-Mar-21 07:15 PM] daemonfox#6136
didnt like cmake for nanomsg


[04-Mar-21 07:15 PM] daemonfox#6136
but


[04-Mar-21 07:16 PM] daemonfox#6136
```hash -r
cmake --version```


[04-Mar-21 07:16 PM] daemonfox#6136
and then it worked


[04-Mar-21 07:16 PM] daemonfox#6136
building komodod now


[04-Mar-21 07:16 PM] daemonfox#6136
then on to dpow and ill be ready to sync things


[04-Mar-21 07:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
for building ut a full node, prob want to do the custom cmake last


[04-Mar-21 07:18 PM] daemonfox#6136
Build using komodo base, nanomsg then komodod and dpow.


[04-Mar-21 07:19 PM] daemonfox#6136
Then blur-api-cpp and finally dpow-blur


[04-Mar-21 07:19 PM] Biz#0842
That sounds logical to me


[04-Mar-21 07:20 PM] Biz#0842
I‚Äôll give things a shot on a fresh build on Saturday. But that sounds like it will work. I‚Äôll add somewhere in instructions the order in which to build these


[04-Mar-21 07:20 PM] daemonfox#6136
awesome


[04-Mar-21 07:21 PM] Biz#0842
What is the significance of the `hash -r` you mentioned above?


[04-Mar-21 07:21 PM] daemonfox#6136
think it flushes the cached cmake its set to use


[04-Mar-21 07:21 PM] Biz#0842
Gotcha. Not familiar with that


[04-Mar-21 07:21 PM] daemonfox#6136
post dpow-blur its working off the custom


[04-Mar-21 07:21 PM] Biz#0842
Ah, okay


[04-Mar-21 07:21 PM] Biz#0842
Makes sense


[04-Mar-21 07:22 PM] daemonfox#6136
running those resets it to the normal cmake is what it reads like to me in the posts


[04-Mar-21 07:22 PM] Biz#0842
Understood


[04-Mar-21 07:23 PM] Biz#0842
Might be worth automating all of this with a script or two


[04-Mar-21 07:23 PM] Biz#0842
Less room for error


[04-Mar-21 07:23 PM] daemonfox#6136
yes thats my mindset


[04-Mar-21 07:23 PM] daemonfox#6136
get the steps down


[04-Mar-21 07:23 PM] daemonfox#6136
repeat and when its strteamlined, we have a simple deploy script

{Reactions}
üëç 

[04-Mar-21 07:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
oh man the blur sync is smooth like butter and just as slick


[04-Mar-21 08:02 PM] Biz#0842
Yeah, those small changes I made really put in some solid work

[04-Mar-21 08:03 PM] Biz#0842
Sweet


[04-Mar-21 08:03 PM] daemonfox#6136
did I need a specific commit?


[04-Mar-21 08:03 PM] daemonfox#6136
or just master


[04-Mar-21 08:04 PM] Biz#0842
I don‚Äôt believe so. Same as master branch. I haven‚Äôt updated in a while though


[04-Mar-21 08:04 PM] Biz#0842
I‚Äôm synced up to chain tip with Komodod, so should be the same


[04-Mar-21 08:04 PM] daemonfox#6136
wait do I need YOUR komodod?


[04-Mar-21 08:04 PM] Biz#0842
Noooo shouldn‚Äôt be necessary


[04-Mar-21 08:05 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok


[04-Mar-21 08:05 PM] daemonfox#6136
was gonna say its from 2019 in your repo


[04-Mar-21 08:05 PM] Biz#0842
Let me know if something goes awry though. You shouldn‚Äôt need my dPoW or komodod


[04-Mar-21 08:05 PM] Biz#0842
Think all of the primary functionality is the same. If it‚Äôs not, I‚Äôll amend of course


[04-Mar-21 08:06 PM] daemonfox#6136
Just need to know what to update to set it for my key


[04-Mar-21 08:06 PM] daemonfox#6136
I grabbed your dPoW


[04-Mar-21 08:06 PM] Biz#0842
That should be fine then. I added your key to config already on that one


[04-Mar-21 08:08 PM] Biz#0842
And yeah, I‚Äôm using KMD‚Äôs komdod, not my own. Think the commit I‚Äôm on is from November. But I can get you the precise commit should you need it. Doubt you will though


[04-Mar-21 08:09 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok cool


[04-Mar-21 08:37 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok what address do I need in komodod?


[04-Mar-21 08:39 PM] Biz#0842
Same secp256k1 pubkey you‚Äôre using for BLUR


[04-Mar-21 08:39 PM] Biz#0842
The one we derived CN keys with


[04-Mar-21 08:40 PM] Biz#0842
Should correspond to the pubkey for `daemonfox_test` in `dPoW/iguana/3rd_party`


[04-Mar-21 08:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
how do I import that to komodo?


[04-Mar-21 08:42 PM] Biz#0842
Need to place it in `komodo/src/pubkey.txt` I think, as well as `komodo-cli importprivkey`


[04-Mar-21 08:43 PM] Biz#0842
Been a while since I last did that though


[04-Mar-21 08:43 PM] daemonfox#6136
yeah... im not 100% how to do that and where the proper privkey would derive from


[04-Mar-21 08:44 PM] daemonfox#6136
I have my keys file


[04-Mar-21 08:44 PM] Biz#0842
which keys file?


[04-Mar-21 08:45 PM] daemonfox#6136
my wallet.keys file


[04-Mar-21 08:45 PM] daemonfox#6136
daemonfox_NA.keys


[04-Mar-21 08:45 PM] Biz#0842
From blur?


[04-Mar-21 08:45 PM] daemonfox#6136
yes


[04-Mar-21 08:45 PM] Biz#0842
Blur keys are separate


[04-Mar-21 08:45 PM] Biz#0842
You just need your komodo keys that correspond to that wallet


[04-Mar-21 08:46 PM] daemonfox#6136
Yeah then def gonna need a crash course on how to get that lol


[04-Mar-21 08:47 PM] daemonfox#6136
reading the section on getting the key when starting fresh


[04-Mar-21 08:49 PM] Biz#0842
We can regenerate your CN keys if need be


[04-Mar-21 08:49 PM] Biz#0842
But these should be the same ~/.komodo/wallet.dat you generated, prior to that CN keygen


[04-Mar-21 08:49 PM] Biz#0842
If you already transferred that from your other VPS, you should be good already


[04-Mar-21 08:51 PM] daemonfox#6136
oh?


[04-Mar-21 08:51 PM] daemonfox#6136
ill check that now


[04-Mar-21 08:51 PM] Biz#0842
Yes. That KMD address was used to generate your viewkeys on CN. So they are tethered


[04-Mar-21 08:51 PM] daemonfox#6136
there is no wallet.dat file


[04-Mar-21 08:52 PM] daemonfox#6136
i didnt have komodo running until now


[04-Mar-21 08:52 PM] daemonfox#6136
only had dpow-blur

is there a command to dump the needed key fromt he testnet daemon?


[04-Mar-21 08:58 PM] Biz#0842
Only the public key is there, so that won‚Äôt work


[04-Mar-21 08:59 PM] daemonfox#6136
oh did I use my 3P pubkey?


[04-Mar-21 08:59 PM] Biz#0842
Privkey never gets imported to `blurd`. And yeah, most likely

[04-Mar-21 09:01 PM] daemonfox#6136
Used my main node key


[04-Mar-21 09:02 PM] daemonfox#6136
does that mean this needs to use utxos on that address?


[04-Mar-21 09:02 PM] daemonfox#6136
That might intefere with mainnet NN


[04-Mar-21 09:13 PM] Biz#0842
Technically they could be separate. You will just need to use the blur keys you generated with `blurd` and give me your new pubkey you generate for komodo notas


[04-Mar-21 09:13 PM] Biz#0842
Blur notas are blind to what‚Äôs happening on KMD, in current iteration


[04-Mar-21 09:14 PM] Biz#0842
But yes you should probably use a separate wallet for KMD then

Pubkey updated


[04-Mar-21 09:30 PM] daemonfox#6136
do i need to pull and rebuild something?


[04-Mar-21 09:32 PM] Biz#0842
yes, `dPoW` repo


[04-Mar-21 09:32 PM] Biz#0842
or just update your `dPoW/iguana/3rd_party` config


[04-Mar-21 09:32 PM] Biz#0842
you'll also need to put your new pubkey in `komodo/src/pubkey.txt`


[04-Mar-21 09:38 PM] Biz#0842
actually, you shouldn't need to rebuild iguana, since only the config file is changing


[04-Mar-21 09:38 PM] Biz#0842
that file gets called by script, so won't affect built files

[04-Mar-21 09:57 PM] daemonfox#6136
using privkey didnt work


[04-Mar-21 09:59 PM] Biz#0842
I would say try leaving passphrase blank then

To melt!

Got 23 platters of pure Al coated in atomic Platinum to melt into bars and store


[06-Mar-21 03:49 AM] daemonfox#6136
and then the Al shells as well, but they are alloyed so will eventually acid boil and react the elements out separately

[06-Mar-21 02:01 PM] Biz#0842
Let me know when we can give this a go. Wanna see if we progress past the `listunspent` calls with more than one nota online


[06-Mar-21 02:02 PM] Biz#0842
I am doubtful it will, because `scriptPubKey` data probably needs to be valid, but worth a shot prior, I think


[06-Mar-21 02:04 PM] Biz#0842
I‚Äôll drum up some ways to grab this data and have it match the pubkey in question. There might be some way to generate passable data from the `pubkey.txt`, assuming iguana will look in `blur/src/` for that file. But unsure about this as well


[06-Mar-21 03:28 PM] Biz#0842
@daemonfox pubkey's been added


[06-Mar-21 04:07 PM] Biz#0842
I am assuming there is no "Anyone can spend" value that is correct for `P2PKH` txs.  One would need to use a `P2SH` tx to do this, and iguana does not support the `P2SH` script, correct?


[07-Mar-21 09:22 AM] daemonfox#6136

[07-Mar-21 11:18 AM] Biz#0842
that error is definitely not happening on `blur` side, if you're running `blurapiserver` actively


[07-Mar-21 11:49 AM] Biz#0842
@daemonfox check that this command returns correctly: `komodo-cli validateaddress RMQu6wXV7xxAEms67WYekeTfsTBU3BqwtU`


[07-Mar-21 11:49 AM] Biz#0842
if not, your created wallet isn't imported


[07-Mar-21 11:57 AM] daemonfox#6136
It is, I split utxos fine


[07-Mar-21 12:02 PM] Biz#0842
sweet


[07-Mar-21 12:02 PM] Biz#0842
do you have `pubkey.txt` in your `~/komodo/src/pubkey.txt`?


[07-Mar-21 12:03 PM] Biz#0842
also, that repo logs to `log.txt` & `error.txt` in `~/dPoW/iguana/`.. you may find info in those files to figure out what the problem is


[07-Mar-21 12:06 PM] Biz#0842
also, know this is probably a dumb question, but your `komodod`,  `blurd` , and `blurapiserver`, are all running prior to launch of `./m_notary_3rdparty`?


[07-Mar-21 12:51 PM] daemonfox#6136
yes


[07-Mar-21 12:51 PM] daemonfox#6136
and yes


[07-Mar-21 12:54 PM] Biz#0842
huh. i will look into this in a bit. not sure what's up then


[07-Mar-21 01:01 PM] Biz#0842
my last guess before digging further would be your  `wp_7779` file might have a typo in it


[07-Mar-21 01:01 PM] Biz#0842
but you're progressing to `echo $pubkey` in script, so that seems unlikely unless that logging is out-of-order


[07-Mar-21 01:02 PM] Biz#0842
should read: 
```
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7779" --data "{\"method\":\"walletpassphrase\",\"params\":[\"<passwordhere>\", 9999999]}"
```


[07-Mar-21 01:02 PM] Biz#0842
omit `<...>`
--------------------------------------------------


[07-Mar-21 01:06 PM] Biz#0842
Ah, so just tested. It seems most likely that one of the pubkeys in either `~/komodo/src/pubkey.txt` or `~/dPoW/iguana/pubkey.txt` does not match the one iguana is looking for


[07-Mar-21 01:06 PM] Biz#0842
I changed one letter in my `~/dPoW/iguana/pubkey.txt`, and reproduced the same result.


[07-Mar-21 01:08 PM] Biz#0842
changed it back, and no more error


[07-Mar-21 01:09 PM] Biz#0842
I will be back in about 30 minutes, gotta step away for a bit


[07-Mar-21 02:25 PM] Biz#0842
@daemonfox I'm looking at how to generate valid `scriptPubKey` data also, and it looks like we will need to update your blur wallet, otherwise I won't be able to generate the proper value


[07-Mar-21 02:38 PM] Biz#0842
I did just remove some opcodes from the script, though. so we'll see if we can get it to pass without the trailing Checksig

can you tell me if you have any logging in `~/dPoW/iguana/log.txt`


[07-Mar-21 03:50 PM] Biz#0842
might tell us at what point its failing


[07-Mar-21 03:53 PM] Biz#0842
I would also need your password for that.  Can you make sure that your password is correct in `~/dPoW/iguana/wp_7779`? I just changed that and get the same error when that is incorrect


[07-Mar-21 03:54 PM] Biz#0842
needs to be the same one you generated your address with, using deckers `php` key generator


[07-Mar-21 03:55 PM] Biz#0842
assuming that the one you used isn't private information, feel free to send that & the key and I'll see what I can figure out

there is ~ 3 KMD there from ~ 4K blocks ago or less


[07-Mar-21 04:00 PM] Biz#0842
I think I just figured it out. did you try to run `blurapiserver` in background? if so, it should be running in foreground, and hitting `Enter` will kill the server


[07-Mar-21 04:00 PM] Biz#0842
but i'll also try importing your wallet


[07-Mar-21 04:00 PM] Biz#0842
1 sec


[07-Mar-21 04:01 PM] Biz#0842
so all of the ways so far i've found this can happen, before trying wallet quick:

1.) `pubkey.txt` incorrect
2.) password in `wp_7779` is incorrect
3.) `blurapiserver` not running, or not able to take the `validateaddress` RPC call


[07-Mar-21 04:02 PM] Biz#0842
Last thing I can think of might be that iguana is checking `scriptPubKey` which needs to be valid. TonyL and I did not hit this problem before though, he was able to pass address validation


[07-Mar-21 04:03 PM] Biz#0842
k, importing wallet now


[07-Mar-21 04:12 PM] daemonfox#6136
ah ok


[07-Mar-21 04:13 PM] daemonfox#6136
blurapiserver


[07-Mar-21 04:13 PM] Biz#0842
sorry, taking quite a bit of time to import


[07-Mar-21 04:13 PM] daemonfox#6136
whats that command?


[07-Mar-21 04:13 PM] daemonfox#6136
i dont think i started it


[07-Mar-21 04:13 PM] Biz#0842
from `blur-api-cpp/build/bin` ... `./blurapiserver --blur-port=21111`


[07-Mar-21 04:19 PM] daemonfox#6136
```{"result":"success","tag":"2430691415873010074"}
```


[07-Mar-21 04:19 PM] daemonfox#6136
that was it


[07-Mar-21 04:19 PM] daemonfox#6136
blurapiserver wasnt running


[07-Mar-21 04:19 PM] Biz#0842
nice, glad we got it worked out


[07-Mar-21 04:20 PM] Biz#0842
i'll have my stuff back up in a second. importing that key froze my komodod, so iguanas being sleepy


[07-Mar-21 04:20 PM] daemonfox#6136
yeah it took mine a bit as well


[07-Mar-21 04:23 PM] Biz#0842
we're getting very close to this functioning. can feel it in muh bones


[07-Mar-21 04:24 PM] Biz#0842
gonna have to write a little logic to generate valid scripts for BTC in blur's codebase.. but after that we've just got the `signrawtransaction` and `sendrawtransaction` calls to get working, and notarization to KMD should work


[07-Mar-21 04:24 PM] Biz#0842
iguana is handling the `listunspent` calls and picking outputs from them properly, from my logging


[07-Mar-21 04:24 PM] daemonfox#6136
```---- request: {"id":"jl777","agent":"BLUR","method":"getblock","params":["19e0339ac563d08c73e6446ce77441c776d824ca4d91626c2e086b011de4db09"]}

```


[07-Mar-21 04:24 PM] Biz#0842
removing those opcodes made things fail, hough


[07-Mar-21 04:25 PM] Biz#0842
sweet


[07-Mar-21 04:25 PM] Biz#0842
ah, FYI those last commits I made to `blur-api-cpp` broke the `listunspent` comprehension of iguana, so you'll need to update again once I get my komodod back up


[07-Mar-21 04:26 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok


[07-Mar-21 04:26 PM] daemonfox#6136
ping me, ill be readin alt tabbed


[07-Mar-21 04:27 PM] Biz#0842
okay, will do


[07-Mar-21 05:45 PM] Biz#0842
@daemonfox from your iguana logs, can you send me one of your split outputs `scriptPubKey` values?


[07-Mar-21 05:45 PM] Biz#0842
mine look like this for KMD, for example: `21037db090cbbe154b7e0a0742032208250537e42ad822968cd5419ce5913a4d8afbac`


[07-Mar-21 05:46 PM] Biz#0842
they will be in `~/dPoW/iguana/log.txt` for KMD<-iguana RPC `listunspent` call, if you search for `5d341d8d1eac` in that file it should come right up.... that's the tail end of your pubkey, with `ac` at the end


[07-Mar-21 05:47 PM] Biz#0842
I am going to construct a custom `stubserver.cpp` file for `blur-api-cpp` with your keys, to ensure that what I'm planning will work, before I write the necessary code


[07-Mar-21 05:48 PM] Biz#0842
standard transactions do not work, from the looks of it. Iguana is using a custom BTC script


[07-Mar-21 05:48 PM] Biz#0842
I copy and pasted my value from KMD, and it made things work. but these won't be the same for each wallet


[07-Mar-21 06:02 PM] daemonfox#6136
split outputs...


[07-Mar-21 06:02 PM] daemonfox#6136
I didnt use iguana for my initial split of 50


[07-Mar-21 06:03 PM] daemonfox#6136
I used the nntools splitfunds script that does it all in daemon without iguana


[07-Mar-21 06:07 PM] daemonfox#6136
Is this not what you need?  "scriptPubKey": "76a9148516aaae3f0fa5d7068b84076afce3998bd991dd88ac",


[07-Mar-21 06:08 PM] daemonfox#6136
when I grep 5d341d8d1eac log.txt


[07-Mar-21 06:08 PM] daemonfox#6136
it returns nothing


[07-Mar-21 06:20 PM] Biz#0842
Give `listunspent` a search in your log.txt


[07-Mar-21 06:21 PM] Biz#0842
And look for the call from iguana to komodod, whatever is in the `scriptPubKey` field in that line of logging


[07-Mar-21 06:21 PM] Biz#0842
A grep `listunspent`should find it


[07-Mar-21 06:22 PM] Biz#0842
And no, for some reason the equivalent to that `76a914...88ac` isnt being recognized as sufficient by iguana, when checking UTXOs


[07-Mar-21 06:23 PM] Biz#0842
Unsure of why


[07-Mar-21 06:23 PM] Biz#0842
The ones from iguana to blur will be unsuccessful for you, most likely. So it should read `KMD` at the beginning of the logging line


[07-Mar-21 06:27 PM] Biz#0842
Looks like this in mine:


[07-Mar-21 06:27 PM] Biz#0842
```KMD (1, 99999999, ["RVJ1UYh4452z66Tu7yRGWsKY3zALGtYfqo"]) listunspent.([{"txid":"1dfc5ebf4d760794e004330f073b7abe51cec2346ee3c445a5964d2dbef39e86","vout":0,"generated":false,"address":"RVJ1UYh4452z66Tu7yRGWsKY3zALGtYfqo","segid":54,"account":"","amount":0.00010000,"interest":0,"scriptPubKey":"21037db090cbbe154b7e0a0742032208250537e42ad822968cd5419ce5913a4d8afbac","rawconfirmations":190662,"confirmations":190662,"spendable":true}```


[07-Mar-21 06:29 PM] Biz#0842
whatever the `scriptPubKey` value is, for that specific RPC method, is what I need


[07-Mar-21 06:35 PM] Biz#0842
Ah, nevermind! figured out the format


[07-Mar-21 06:39 PM] Biz#0842
@daemonfox so you can actually just update with following procedure:

1.) update `blur-api-cpp` with a `git pull`
2.) `rm -rf build`
3.) locate file: `blur-api-cpp/src/examples/stubserver.cpp.daemonfox`
4.) `rm src/examples/stubserver.cpp` 
5.) `mv src/examples/stubserver.cpp.daemonfox src/examples/stubserver.cpp`
6.) rebuild


[07-Mar-21 06:40 PM] Biz#0842
added a file which matches your keys


[07-Mar-21 06:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
Ok will do


[07-Mar-21 07:10 PM] daemonfox#6136
@Biz its up

[07-Mar-21 08:50 PM] Biz#0842
Nice! Once you see a `listunspent` in blurapiserver, paste some logging here from log.txt


[07-Mar-21 08:51 PM] Biz#0842
what you're looking for is something similar to the following:


[07-Mar-21 08:51 PM] Biz#0842
```
[BLUR] : chosen = 8  out of 10 loop.(0)
PAXWDCRC.6ab6b224 myind.3 isratify.0 DPOW.BLUR statemachine checkpoint.28354 59b031d83bd562a36a355d5a0ff223f55a28134bb1ebb82da7d4afa92c06644c start.1615178563+dur.300 vs 1615178563 MoM[0] 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
```


[07-Mar-21 08:56 PM] Biz#0842
A failure will instead look like: 
```[BLUR] : chosen = 8  out of 10 loop.(0)
[BLUR] : chosen = 7  out of 10 loop.(0)
[BLUR] : chosen = 2  out of 10 loop.(0)

no [...] utxo: need to fund address [...] or wait for splitfund to confirm`
```


[07-Mar-21 08:58 PM] Biz#0842
^ i consrtucted the above failure myself, but it will look very similar


[07-Mar-21 09:13 PM] Biz#0842
I‚Äôm off to bed for the evening. Will be working more on this tomorrow, though


[08-Mar-21 05:12 AM] daemonfox#6136
I dont see any lines like that


[08-Mar-21 07:53 AM] Biz#0842
Can you upload your log.txt to here or pastebin


[08-Mar-21 07:55 AM] Biz#0842
I‚Äôm gonna add some code to allow blur-api-cpp to be run in background today also


[08-Mar-21 07:56 AM] Biz#0842
Oh, did we ever add your static IP to config file?


[08-Mar-21 07:58 AM] Biz#0842
Also, @TonyL recognize its probably very late for you rn, but we can get you set up later on tonight (EST), tomorrow morning for you


[08-Mar-21 10:56 AM] daemonfox#6136
no i never set it static... ill get that later today.


[08-Mar-21 10:57 AM] daemonfox#6136
prob why my iguana doesnt move, the normal routing does not allow stuff like this to dial in unless I make exceptions.


[08-Mar-21 12:34 PM] Biz#0842
ahh, okay yeah. that's why you aren't progressing to the same spot in cycle that I am


[08-Mar-21 01:05 PM] Biz#0842
Ooh didn‚Äôt know iguana needed 50 utxos minimum. That would explain a lot


[08-Mar-21 02:24 PM] daemonfox#6136
wait what?


[08-Mar-21 02:24 PM] daemonfox#6136
i dont recall a 50 min...


[08-Mar-21 02:36 PM] Biz#0842

whoops, I am misinterpreting


[08-Mar-21 02:55 PM] Biz#0842
thanks for getting me to look a little closer at that logic haha


[08-Mar-21 03:03 PM] Biz#0842
In normal execution, do you know if progression to `sendrawtransaction` happens if too few notaries are online?


[08-Mar-21 03:09 PM] daemonfox#6136
no, it sees that and in the last iterative loop it dumps everything


[08-Mar-21 03:09 PM] daemonfox#6136
I see this in LABS when we lose a node or two


[08-Mar-21 03:09 PM] Biz#0842
okay, I though that's what was occuring


[08-Mar-21 03:09 PM] daemonfox#6136
yup


[08-Mar-21 03:09 PM] Biz#0842
It looks like `bp->ratify` is never being set, so nota cycle is halting, even though we're properly grabbing utxos from blur.  we're making it at least to there, though


[08-Mar-21 03:09 PM] daemonfox#6136
its dumps everyones cached utxos and starts a new round


[08-Mar-21 03:10 PM] Biz#0842
cool. that's the behavior i'm seeing


[08-Mar-21 03:10 PM] daemonfox#6136
cool


[08-Mar-21 03:10 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok ill be restarting everything on a static shortly


[08-Mar-21 03:10 PM] Biz#0842
I will probably grab a second VPS for this month, so that we can get 3 nota nodes up. I know tony's on a different timezone, while you and I are generally awake at similar times


[08-Mar-21 03:11 PM] Biz#0842
sounds good


[08-Mar-21 03:25 PM] daemonfox#6136
23.124.56.139


[08-Mar-21 03:25 PM] daemonfox#6136
what all ports do we need opened for this?


[08-Mar-21 03:42 PM] Biz#0842
Let me check quick


[08-Mar-21 03:43 PM] Biz#0842
iguana: 17774
blurapiserver: 8383
blurd: 21111 for RPC, 11111 for P2P
komdod: 7771 for RPC, not sure on p2p


[08-Mar-21 03:44 PM] Biz#0842
rpcs only happen locally, though, so not sure how restrictive your port stuff is with local comms


[08-Mar-21 03:46 PM] Biz#0842
just updated your IP in config files. feel free to delete that message you sent if you dont want IP floating around here


[08-Mar-21 03:53 PM] daemonfox#6136
7770


[08-Mar-21 03:54 PM] daemonfox#6136
RPC ports shouldnt be opened


[08-Mar-21 03:54 PM] daemonfox#6136
iguana and p2p should suffice, if we are relying on open RPC ports, that might be a bit skethc for prod use


[08-Mar-21 03:54 PM] Biz#0842
nah, shouldn't be necessary


[08-Mar-21 03:54 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok cool


[08-Mar-21 04:06 PM] daemonfox#6136
and I am starting the dPoW with ./m_notary_3rdparty


[08-Mar-21 04:06 PM] daemonfox#6136
when I do it seems ok, but just dups to a fresh prompt

`m_notary_3rdparty` in my repo logs iguana `stdout` to dPoW/iguana/log.txt


[08-Mar-21 04:17 PM] Biz#0842
Logs bitcoind_RPC calls to error.txt


[08-Mar-21 04:17 PM] Biz#0842
In same directory. The two streams were overwriting each other without doing that for me


[08-Mar-21 04:18 PM] Biz#0842
So, you can find what logging there is in that file. It‚Äôs necessary to clear it each time you want a fresh log


[08-Mar-21 04:19 PM] Biz#0842
If you don‚Äôt like that behavior, you can change the top line in that script to be equivalent to that which is in Komodo‚Äôs DPoW repo


[08-Mar-21 04:19 PM] Biz#0842
It will keep running in background, with my setup


[08-Mar-21 04:20 PM] Biz#0842
Does that make sense or am I not explaining well?


[08-Mar-21 04:21 PM] Biz#0842
your init happened properly, though. just the output file of logs that I changed

looking solid.  seeing `signrawtransaction` and `decoderawtransaction` calls.  `listunspent` is being handled and we're progressing past that point


[08-Mar-21 04:46 PM] Biz#0842
`blur-api-cpp` is not handling the `decoderawtransaction`, so will work on that tomorrow.

yes

instead of relying on iguana


[08-Mar-21 05:45 PM] daemonfox#6136
and then cronjobs are set to call and make sends depending on how many min utxos you define, then uses iguana to send those automatically


[08-Mar-21 05:47 PM] Biz#0842
Sweet, I‚Äôll check those out. That sounds useful

Think there‚Äôs anything to be gained by completing that `decoderawtransaction` method?


[08-Mar-21 06:09 PM] Biz#0842
Would clean up logging of course

Gonna sign off for the night. Long day today and gonna unwind with some tv


[08-Mar-21 06:16 PM] Biz#0842
Will fine-tune some things and probably implement that decode method tomo


[08-Mar-21 06:16 PM] Biz#0842
Thanks for the help @daemonfox, really has been immensely helpful having you around


[08-Mar-21 06:31 PM] Biz#0842
Oh, also going to implement pubkey discernment from base58 addys


[08-Mar-21 06:32 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok and np, happy to help, this is fun.

[09-Mar-21 10:12 AM] Biz#0842
@daemonfox I am having some trouble modifying these nntools scripts due to the lack of a `${coin}-cli` for blur


[09-Mar-21 10:16 AM] Biz#0842
will keep familiarizing myself with the scripts, though.


[09-Mar-21 10:21 AM] Biz#0842
until then, is there a specific message I will see in iguana with each notarization to KMD that takes place?


[09-Mar-21 10:21 AM] Biz#0842
something like this, i gather: 
```6ab6b224 ht.30018 [3] ips.2 BLUR NOTARIZE.2 matches.2 paxmatches.2 bestmatches.2 bestk.0:0 9 recv.9 sigmasks.(8 0) senderind.0 state.0 (d831b059 0 0) MoM.0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 [0]
```


[09-Mar-21 10:25 AM] Biz#0842
I do see this happening each time KMD completes cycle = `complete statemachine.KMD ht.29572 state.1000 (d831b059 e4392de8)`


[09-Mar-21 10:25 AM] Biz#0842
I'm going to add a `bp->srccoin->symbol` to that logging, to make things more visible for myself

will be working on base58 key importing to `blurd` so that we don't have to do that hacky `blur-api-cpp` `scriptPubKey` workaround any longer.  Also plan to do something about `decoderawtransaction` errors today


[09-Mar-21 11:02 AM] Biz#0842
going to tie that pubkey discernment to `validateaddress` method, and import it to a global variable so that valid scriptpubkeys can be generated by blurd-rpc


[09-Mar-21 11:13 AM] daemonfox#6136
sounds good

added the Base58 addy decoding. I'm getting a rmd160 value from the decoding though, so we'll have to use the P2PKH format, instead of the long form P2PK that was working yesterday.

You'll see the following loggin in blurd when it happens:```

```


[09-Mar-21 01:03 PM] daemonfox#6136
might ask Decker about the key conversions... he seems to be excellent witht hat


[09-Mar-21 01:04 PM] Biz#0842
It might be my pubkey version that's causing the problem. You're using a `02` while mines a `03`


[09-Mar-21 01:05 PM] Biz#0842
but I don't think we can navigate backwards from a `rmd160` value if that's what's encoded in my address. doing so would require pre-image


[09-Mar-21 01:05 PM] Biz#0842
but sure, Decker will be more knowledgable than I for sure


[09-Mar-21 01:06 PM] daemonfox#6136
Everytime I ask himsomething like this, he gives me another piece of the puzzle I typically fail to consider


[09-Mar-21 01:07 PM] daemonfox#6136
Might be able to get a CN key added to the php gen script


[09-Mar-21 01:07 PM] daemonfox#6136
then it would all tie to one pubkey


[09-Mar-21 01:07 PM] Biz#0842
ah, you just gave me an idea. We'll need matching keys in the `komodo_notaries.cpp` table. but I can calculate from those


[09-Mar-21 01:08 PM] Biz#0842
I'll just have to write up some code to do the equivalent of sha256(rmd160(pubkey)) and reference against the table that's hardcoded


[09-Mar-21 01:08 PM] Biz#0842
we'll need to gen you a new wallet, if we go that route


[09-Mar-21 01:08 PM] Biz#0842
and yeah, this style of `scriptPubKey` is failing iguana


[09-Mar-21 01:08 PM] daemonfox#6136
that should be fine... its how the KMD to BTC notas work... our keys are embedded in the updated komodod source


[09-Mar-21 01:09 PM] Biz#0842
ok, I'll get to work on that. once I'm done, we'll get you a new CN wallet


[09-Mar-21 01:09 PM] daemonfox#6136
anyone can nota to KMD if they set their own iguana up... but only us 64 can KMD nota to BTC

[09-Mar-21 04:34 PM] Biz#0842
unless something changes here suddenly


[09-Mar-21 06:00 PM] Biz#0842
So, got things compiling after adding files to calculate hash160s... but am not getting the right numbers.  I'm thinking the easier route might just be to import a pubkey on startup to `blurd` via commandline


[09-Mar-21 06:57 PM] daemonfox#6136
if it is all generated at once, that should be fine... or is that what isn;t coming out as expected?


[10-Mar-21 09:01 AM] Biz#0842
I‚Äôm gonna take another crack at this today. But if it doesn‚Äôt work, importing a user-specified pubkey on init will


[10-Mar-21 09:02 AM] Biz#0842
In re-approaching this today, I think I see the error I made


[10-Mar-21 09:03 AM] Biz#0842
I‚Äôll commit the files to a separate branch for now. I modified Komodo‚Äôs double sha function to perform a single hashing, rather that two, and then run that through ripemd. Also added some structures to our crypto lib to handle 33-byte pubkeys


[10-Mar-21 09:05 AM] Biz#0842
My plan was to cross-reference that resulting value from the address decoding, against the values generated from table of hardcoded pubkeys... but if im not getting the right values, it will be less work to just import the full pubkey, rather than generating short-form ones


[10-Mar-21 09:06 AM] Biz#0842
Don‚Äôt want this to drag out into a 3 day effort


[10-Mar-21 12:58 PM] Biz#0842
@daemonfox got that command-line pubkey import working.  That also is ignorant to the hardcoded keys, in its current iteration.  So, no need to update your CN keys.  But you can pull and rebuild `dpow-blur` and `blur-api-cpp`.  

No need to switch out that `blur-api-cpp/src/examples/stubserver.cpp.daemonfox` file any longer

you should, however, launch blur with `./blurd --testnet --p2p-bind-port=11111 --btc-pubkey=<33-byte pubkey>`

Example, for my key: `./blurd --testnet --p2p-bind-port=11111 --btc-pubkey=037db090cbbe154b7e0a0742032208250537e42ad822968cd5419ce5913a4d8afb`


[10-Mar-21 01:00 PM] Biz#0842
I'll update instructions with this information in both repos


[10-Mar-21 01:00 PM] Biz#0842

[10-Mar-21 02:50 PM] daemonfox#6136
Sweet!


[10-Mar-21 02:51 PM] daemonfox#6136
Ill play with this soon and let you know

@ca333 need some assistance finishing this discord bridge when you get a moment. DMed you the token for bridge bot

[10-Mar-21 04:32 PM] Biz#0842
Also started making some modifications to this repo, locally. Gonna require some additional scripting to get this working, as most of it is highly dependent on bitcoin-cli-like semantics


[10-Mar-21 04:32 PM] Biz#0842
but will definitely take the initiative to do so if it will help out the nnops

We now have a functioning bridge between komodo's #üíéÔΩúblur channel, and the blur discord üëç

@daemonfox is there a way I can view which chains have been included in a KMD nota tx?


[11-Mar-21 09:54 AM] Biz#0842
I'm showing this in `nntools/stats` script: 
```
-CHAIN-     -NOTR- -LASTN- -UTXO-    -BAL-   -BLOX- -LASTB- -CON- -SIZE- -TIME-
KMD[U]                  2D     53    0.227  2301089     32s    16   144K  0.017 0 mined
```


[11-Mar-21 09:55 AM] daemonfox#6136
Direct from KMD? You would need to chain through the pubkeys known publicly


[11-Mar-21 09:55 AM] Biz#0842
but i'd like to actually be able to view some OPRETURN data, or at least where blur is being included


[11-Mar-21 09:56 AM] daemonfox#6136
but I dont think there is a way to tell backwards a block has BLUR notas in it


[11-Mar-21 09:57 AM] daemonfox#6136
without first knowing a BLUR nota happened and at what height


[11-Mar-21 09:57 AM] daemonfox#6136
also that would indicate that node address hasnt sent a KMD utxxos in 2 days


[11-Mar-21 09:59 AM] Biz#0842
yeah, this much I recognize. Has your iguana been online since then?


[11-Mar-21 09:59 AM] daemonfox#6136
nope


[11-Mar-21 09:59 AM] Biz#0842
I think that was the last time we had things up and running.. I'm not attempting to nota any other chains atm


[11-Mar-21 09:59 AM] daemonfox#6136
been doing surgery


[11-Mar-21 09:59 AM] daemonfox#6136

[11-Mar-21 10:00 AM] daemonfox#6136
yes very


[11-Mar-21 10:00 AM] daemonfox#6136
went from ~25/26 Msols on VRSChash


[11-Mar-21 10:00 AM] daemonfox#6136
to 34


[11-Mar-21 10:00 AM] Biz#0842
sizeable jump


[11-Mar-21 11:07 AM] Biz#0842
So, I'm modifying the nn tools scripts, to also spit out a "last notarization txid" column when running stats


[11-Mar-21 11:08 AM] Biz#0842
Am I correct that in `listtransactions`, this is what a successful nota will look like?

ah, figured it out


[11-Mar-21 11:33 AM] Biz#0842
created a fork of `nntools` here: https://github.com/who-biz/nntools.

`stats` script now outputs the following:

[11-Mar-21 11:35 AM] Biz#0842
once I add support for blur i'll create a true fork and PR the changes

and my node is almost back up


[11-Mar-21 02:54 PM] Biz#0842
Take your time. I‚Äôm running to the store quick while my repo rebuilds with the batch of refactoring changes I‚Äôm working on


[11-Mar-21 03:05 PM] Biz#0842
Don‚Äôt worry about building again once I commit them. Nothing functional, just incorporating some small changes from core repo


[11-Mar-21 04:03 PM] Biz#0842
got everything back up on my end


[11-Mar-21 09:13 PM] daemonfox#6136

and the wallet blocked one of your nodes earlier


[12-Mar-21 07:18 AM] Biz#0842
Thanks, I will look into it in a bit. That can happen when a nota cycle completes, but shouldn‚Äôt result in a block unless there‚Äôs node disagreement


[12-Mar-21 08:31 AM] Biz#0842
@daemonfox was the IP that was blocked the one ending in `177`?


[12-Mar-21 08:31 AM] Biz#0842
That's the one I'm showing out-of-sync at the moment


[12-Mar-21 08:32 AM] daemonfox#6136
yes


[12-Mar-21 08:32 AM] Biz#0842
rest are at `34036` block height


[12-Mar-21 08:32 AM] Biz#0842
okay. will look into what occurred


[12-Mar-21 08:32 AM] daemonfox#6136
more fails too


[12-Mar-21 08:33 AM] Biz#0842
going to leave that one offline while I investigate. The fails are normal at the end of a nota cycle, if txs in txpool are also attempted to be added to ntzpool.  I'll handle that case though, as it looks more concerning by logging than it should


[12-Mar-21 08:34 AM] Biz#0842
going to use the same behavior i used for `ntzpool tx` received while syncing


[12-Mar-21 08:34 AM] Biz#0842
should keep things operating more smoothly and without false positives


[12-Mar-21 08:36 AM] Biz#0842
looks like one `blur-notary-server-rpc` crashed also. so i just spun that back up
----------------------------------------------------


[12-Mar-21 08:37 AM] Biz#0842
I take it there were no issues with `iguana` and the new `scriptPubKey` fields being fed from blurd's rpc?


[12-Mar-21 08:38 AM] Biz#0842
I'm seeing we had a handful of nota cycles on KMD


[12-Mar-21 08:39 AM] Biz#0842
also, my balance increased to >3 KMD. was that you or did I mine a block somehow?

if you imported my key earlier, you also have those KMD lol

i dont show me notarizing in last 5 hours though


[12-Mar-21 10:43 AM] Biz#0842
same here. not sure why. Let me finish up these explorer changes, and i'll dig in


[12-Mar-21 11:10 AM] Biz#0842
how do I remove your wallet using `komodo-cli`?


[12-Mar-21 11:11 AM] Biz#0842
if there isn't a way, I'll just backup wallet, and reimport my key i guess


[12-Mar-21 11:21 AM] daemonfox#6136
you dont


[12-Mar-21 11:21 AM] daemonfox#6136
you remove the wallet.dat


[12-Mar-21 11:21 AM] daemonfox#6136
relaunch


[12-Mar-21 11:21 AM] daemonfox#6136
and reimport your keys


[12-Mar-21 11:21 AM] daemonfox#6136
you can do a partial rescan


[12-Mar-21 11:21 AM] Biz#0842
okay, will do


[12-Mar-21 11:21 AM] daemonfox#6136
by using komodo-cli importprivkey KEY "" true BLOCKTOSCANFROM


[12-Mar-21 11:25 AM] Biz#0842

There is now a testnet explorer up at: https://testnetexplorer.blur.cash/


[12-Mar-21 12:23 PM] Biz#0842
includes a pending nota tx pool


[12-Mar-21 12:23 PM] Biz#0842
not sure if it works properly or not yet


[12-Mar-21 12:28 PM] Biz#0842
@daemonfox, ensure that your `blurapiserver` is still running.. iguana won't notarize if that crashes, and I'm getting crashes that aren't immediately obvious on that server recetnly


[12-Mar-21 12:28 PM] Biz#0842
I'm spinning my iguana back up now


[12-Mar-21 12:29 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok


[12-Mar-21 01:14 PM] Biz#0842
is your KMD NN online currently?  I'm unsure of why cycles aren't happening presently if so


[12-Mar-21 01:33 PM] daemonfox#6136
it seems it is

hmm. alright, i'll be back in 30 minutes or so and will try to figure out why.  I can also update the m_notary_3rd party script if you prefer that it prints to stdout, rather than a log file ( the usual behavior your mentioned)


[12-Mar-21 01:41 PM] Biz#0842
also, just as an FYI that testnet explorer now has a functioning pending ntzpool that displays at the top of page


[12-Mar-21 02:27 PM] Biz#0842
Alright, back and checking out logs now


[12-Mar-21 02:38 PM] Biz#0842
did you launch your blurd with `--btc-pubkey=<33 byte key>`? I'm not seeing anything in logs indicative of what might be the issue, presently.  Maybe best to relaunch blurd, blurapiserver, and iguana


[12-Mar-21 02:38 PM] Biz#0842
I will do the same.


[12-Mar-21 02:38 PM] Biz#0842
and please post here when you relaunch so I can observe in real time


[12-Mar-21 03:07 PM] Biz#0842
I also removed your wallet stuff, on the off-chance that was interfering somehow


[12-Mar-21 03:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok im shutting it down and relaunching

üëç 

[12-Mar-21 03:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
for --btc-pubkey=<33 byte key> is this the KMD pubkey?


[12-Mar-21 03:18 PM] Biz#0842
Yes, the one that iguana spits out on init as `btcpubkey`


[12-Mar-21 03:19 PM] Biz#0842

[12-Mar-21 03:44 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok


[12-Mar-21 03:44 PM] daemonfox#6136
wont I need both though...


[12-Mar-21 03:44 PM] daemonfox#6136
to make a nota?


[12-Mar-21 03:45 PM] Biz#0842
nah. as long as `blurd` is running, iguana will be able to fetch the data from our network


[12-Mar-21 03:45 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok


[12-Mar-21 03:45 PM] Biz#0842
remember, your keys are technically separate at the moment


[12-Mar-21 03:46 PM] daemonfox#6136
yes


[12-Mar-21 03:46 PM] Biz#0842
all the non-chain data from blur is mocked for iguana tx creation.  So just `blurd`, `iguana`, `blurapiserver`and `komodod` are necessary for this part of testing


[12-Mar-21 03:47 PM] daemonfox#6136
got it


[12-Mar-21 03:47 PM] daemonfox#6136
if you push those dPoW changes ill pull those too


[12-Mar-21 03:47 PM] Biz#0842
sure, one sec


[12-Mar-21 03:51 PM] Biz#0842

[12-Mar-21 03:59 PM] Biz#0842
my iguana.log was being ovewritten by the added logging i added to `bitcoind_rpc`, so probably my fault


[12-Mar-21 04:01 PM] Biz#0842
should you wanna revert to the other behavior, just commend out the `stdbuf` line, and uncomment the one below it


[12-Mar-21 04:02 PM] Biz#0842
sorry for the extreme logging verbosity lol, my debugs are intense

when ya get a chance, check if your iguana is spitting out this line at any point: `[BLUR] : chosen = 14  out of 50 loop.(0)` should occur every time there is a `listunspent` call issued to blur.  if you have multiple of those lines in a row, there's a problem

@Decker I'm working on decoding `OP_RETURN` data in BLUR->KMD notarization txs (on Komodo's chain)...

I recall a post from bitcointalk, in which you break down the nota data with `BEER` and `PIZZA` notarization examples.  Do you have that link by any chance?  I can't find it in my old messages


[15-Mar-21 02:33 PM] Biz#0842
I am noticing only a few bytes vary from one `vout`s script to another.

 for example:
```
4c64062ca9afd4a72db8ebb14b13285af523f20f5a5d356aa362d53bd831b0594a8b0000424c555200

4c64062ca9afd4a72db8ebb14b13285af523f20f5a5d356aa362d53bd831b059408b0000424c555200
4c64062ca9afd4a72db8ebb14b13285af523f20f5a5d356aa362d53bd831b05922890000424c555200
``` 
are 4 separate `OP_RETURN` asms (excluding opcode and varint length) from different nota txs in my `komodod`. I'm trying to understand the significance of these.  any info is helpful


[15-Mar-21 02:44 PM] Biz#0842

@daemonfox I just made some changes to our `listunspent` method in blurd's RPC. Would be cool if we could spin things up again, to see if that OP_RETURN data changes


[16-Mar-21 03:10 PM] Biz#0842
I would expect each script in KMD notas to reflect 'last notarized hash' on BLUR, rather than genesis block hash repeatedly, with these changes

this is weird


[16-Mar-21 05:52 PM] Biz#0842
Yeah, truthfully I am not sure what changed that allowed this behavior. I need to look into it. I knew something was amiss immediately upon checking out explorer. Some nodes are ignoring consensus rules somehow from the looks of it.

Not possible, so has to be another source but idk what broke things


[16-Mar-21 05:53 PM] Biz#0842

@daemonfox rolling back to block 38837 should do the trick.

friendly check that you started blur with `./blurd --testnet --btc-pubkey=<33byte pubkey>`?


[18-Mar-21 01:56 PM] Biz#0842
@daemonfox not seeing cycles happen. has anything changed on your setup since our last test run?


[18-Mar-21 01:56 PM] daemonfox#6136
Nope


[18-Mar-21 01:57 PM] daemonfox#6136
I'll double check the script maybe it didn't save


[18-Mar-21 01:58 PM] Biz#0842
okay, i'll check my setup too and make sure nothing's amiss on my end

Think we are ready for another round of `iguana` testing. finished up the `decoderawtransaction` method in blurd/blur-api-cpp.

response data probably still needs tweaked in `signrawtransaction`, but we should give this a go first


[25-Mar-21 02:07 PM] Biz#0842
@daemonfox lmk whenever you're free to give this a go

looks like there is some necessary tx data missing in blur responses. i'll be writing up a way to account for the submitted data, and reflect it properly in RPC response. happening in `signrawtransaction` at first glance


[31-Mar-21 12:21 PM] Biz#0842

[01-Apr-21 09:55 AM] Biz#0842
@daemonfox just got `signrawtransaction` working. Gonna do a little more testing, but also implemented some `ScriptPubKey` cacheing in blurd so that `decoderawtransaction` can also reflect those input values from iguana.

Should be good for new round of testing in T-1 hour

Let me know whenever works for you. No rush

you will need to update both:
- `dpow-blur` repo
    -- be sure to launch blurd with: 
```./blurd --testnet --p2p-bind-port=11111 --btc-pubkey=026b2a11cb90960c59a9d46d2fb31819767af15edcd0b4c32cfb43895d341d8d1e```
- `blur-api-cpp` repo


[01-Apr-21 02:36 PM] Biz#0842
komodo & dPoW repositories have not changed


[01-Apr-21 02:37 PM] Biz#0842
I am spinning my node back up now, so will be online rest of evening


[02-Apr-21 04:20 PM] Biz#0842
@daemonfox added my testnet node info to https://github.com/who-biz/dPoW.git to speed along testing a little hopefully. You will need to pull `3rd_party` config file, and new launch script from that repo when ya spin things back up

testing changes to `blur-api-cpp` presently

formatting fixed. now just adding changes to ensure that we're using a valid BLUR hash


[02-Apr-21 07:36 PM] daemonfox#6136
ok so what needs done at this poinmt?


[02-Apr-21 07:43 PM] Biz#0842
testing to ensure the changes i just made are working, currently


[02-Apr-21 07:43 PM] Biz#0842
once that's done, relaunch of BLUR testnet, and some upscaled testing


[02-Apr-21 07:46 PM] Biz#0842
updating `who-biz/dPoW` `blur-api-cpp` and `dpow-blur` is the first step


[02-Apr-21 07:47 PM] Biz#0842
then spin up iggy. testing is a little slow just between my 2 nodes.  think we could speed it up with a third nota node.

[05-Apr-21 11:29 AM] daemonfox#6136
cool


[07-Apr-21 08:23 AM] Biz#0842
Just an update that everything seems to be working properly between blur and iguana RPC. Did some additional testing last night. 

Still seeing genesis block embedded in KMD tx data, and it appears for some reason iguana is asking blurd repeatedly for `getblockhash` at height 0. Close to finding the reason why, however.


[07-Apr-21 08:24 AM] Biz#0842
Going to commit some code shortly and will update with results


[07-Apr-21 08:25 AM] Biz#0842
@daemonfox if you have any ideas on why this is occurring, let me know. I am seeing proper hash from chain tip passed through to iguana, and in logging. But that is not carrying all the way through notarization


[07-Apr-21 08:27 AM] daemonfox#6136
I believe it expects a block height for nota activation in the updated blurd that iguana is also set for


[07-Apr-21 08:27 AM] daemonfox#6136
or something akin to that


[07-Apr-21 08:27 AM] daemonfox#6136
it should be asking for that activation block hash


[07-Apr-21 08:27 AM] daemonfox#6136
or it is looking for the last notarized block hash


[07-Apr-21 08:28 AM] daemonfox#6136
but doesnt know what height for some reason so is being passed 0


[07-Apr-21 08:30 AM] daemonfox#6136
from what you describe, iguana needs to know how to fetch last nota block hash from blurd


[07-Apr-21 08:31 AM] daemonfox#6136
might be a validation piece to fetch it from somewhere else other than the chain tip


[07-Apr-21 08:34 AM] Biz#0842
When you say ‚Äúnota activation‚Äù what do you mean?


[07-Apr-21 08:35 AM] Biz#0842
I‚Äôll make sure `last_notarized_hash` is being handled correctly by iguana also. Thanks, above sounds helpful


[07-Apr-21 08:49 AM] daemonfox#6136
when a third party coin comes to dPoW


[07-Apr-21 08:49 AM] daemonfox#6136
There is a bit of added code shared between KMD and that coin daemon that set the official start height of valid notarization.


[07-Apr-21 08:50 AM] daemonfox#6136
iguana wont allow it to nota before that height and expects to be able to validate a new nota back to that


[07-Apr-21 09:02 AM] Biz#0842
Okay, that sounds like the piece I am missing


[07-Apr-21 09:03 AM] Biz#0842
Is there documentation for that specific requirement somewhere?

Looks like several things leading to that and maybe after are part of adding the needed dPoW requirements to the 3p daemon code


[07-Apr-21 09:15 AM] daemonfox#6136
those deckerSU commits are likely key

I love when I see phm typing!


[07-Apr-21 09:21 AM] phm87#7395
About adding dpow and dpowconf into 3P coins, there were an article from mylo and an explanation from luke in the past


[07-Apr-21 09:21 AM] daemonfox#6136
yay!


[07-Apr-21 09:22 AM] daemonfox#6136
I tried and havent found it yet


[07-Apr-21 09:22 AM] daemonfox#6136
So found those commits


[07-Apr-21 09:22 AM] phm87#7395
There were different implementations I remember, txindex used or not. Plus different BTC 0.x variants


[07-Apr-21 09:23 AM] Biz#0842
I have already added dpowconfs, and equivalent code to all in those Decker commits. Only piece that isn‚Äôt there in our codebase seems to be the season activation height/time.


[07-Apr-21 09:24 AM] Biz#0842
Txindex is always = 1 in xmr world

For the fun, I began to add dpow into a btc fork, it was stopped, never tested except compilation. I can't share publicly, I will send you DM


[07-Apr-21 09:25 AM] Biz#0842
Cool, thanks

I will look into the season activation heights. Might be where the problem is arising


[07-Apr-21 09:28 AM] daemonfox#6136
Ill be making some hardware changes these next few weeks so will likely rebuild a new VM when this is ready for the next stage.


[07-Apr-21 09:28 AM] daemonfox#6136
Can do a full run down of installer and make an init style deploy and guide during that time


[07-Apr-21 09:33 AM] Biz#0842
Cool. I do expect to have this fixed at some point today. I‚Äôve got two nodes currently for testing, so no rush in spinning things back up. We‚Äôll relaunch testnet before your new setup too

@metaphilibert can you elaborate on how a 3P instance of iguana interfered with your main instance? I‚Äôm running both on my testnet NN and have not experienced this


[11-Apr-21 11:45 AM] Biz#0842
Would like to resolve bugs even though setup will be independent from main nodes, in production


[12-Apr-21 09:35 AM] Biz#0842
Polling for some opinions:

**Would it be useful if NN ops could provide a password to generate CN spendkeys?**

Currently, libhydrogen generates a random 256-bit number, which is used to seed CN spendkey generation. 

Viewkeys are generated from an existing secp256k1 pubkey. We don‚Äôt plan on changing viewkey generation, as these should be able to be safely computed from known NN pubkey info (for transparency‚Äôs sake of NN *inbound* txs with RingCT). 

However, I‚Äôm looking for ways to eliminate CMake 3.14+ dependency... being that libhydrogen is the only source which requires it as a dependency.  This has an added bonus of potentially allowing generation of many CN keys from a user-supplied passphrase, or from random bytes (as we‚Äôve been doing).

Thoughts? I‚Äôd like to make CN keygen as easy as possible using existing KMD (read: pre-approved/audited) tools/scripts.


[12-Apr-21 09:37 AM] Biz#0842
‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî
Private spendkeys need to be kept secret, the same way privkeys do in BTC/KMD world.  Conversely, viewkeys can be disclosed, without risk of a third party spending your funds.


[12-Apr-21 09:38 AM] Biz#0842
Let me know if any of above is unclear. Happy to disambiguate

@Biz sorry for late answer
I did not investigate much but for 3 times, when I was launching separate instance of iguana for blur dPoW, the tesnet iguana was notarizing less and less until no nota at all
Began with RICK and MORTY then LTC

Going to be working on BLUR-side stuff over the afternoon/evening hours. 

We‚Äôll couple a testnet relaunch with these changes, as some will be consensus-related. Not sure when that will occur though. Before work week‚Äôs end for sure


[13-Apr-21 11:49 AM] Biz#0842
At either rate, no need for immediate monitoring. I did add a cool `OP_RETURN` decoding RPC to blurd though:

Yesterday, @phm87 messaged me yesterday inquiring if BLUR had a donation address for KMD. 

We don‚Äôt, but I think it would be good to set one up. I‚Äôd like to do this with transparency and some sort of multisig setup.

I also just spoke with @daemonfox who agreed it is a good idea. With that said, I‚Äôd like to have some oversight at KMD for use of these funds. 

Due to familiarity daemon fox has with blur, I think he‚Äôs a great candidate for an msig key holder.

Posting this here to get a dialogue rolling


[14-Apr-21 12:10 PM] Biz#0842
I‚Äôm not sure how these sorts of things are managed typically at KMD, so open to hear ways you‚Äôve all gone about funding in the past.


[14-Apr-21 12:11 PM] Biz#0842
I also think there is a strong opportunity  for some sort of collaboration between BLUR and LABS here.

Multisignature Transaction Creation and Walkthrough
Multisignature (multisig) is a technology used to increase the number of signatures required for a transaction from an address. This provides an additional layer of security to cryptocurrency transactions.

Hello. I think that it is good to create a Blur donation address to help about infra and dPoW costs. I'd be happy to help, I can be a cosigner of the multisig. :-)


[14-Apr-21 12:19 PM] Biz#0842
How many is optimal?


[14-Apr-21 12:22 PM] Biz#0842
3/4 scheme might be the best, in my opinion, if we can recruit someone from BLUR world to also do the job. This way it‚Äôs (2 from KMD or BLUR) + (at least 1 from other party)


[14-Apr-21 12:23 PM] Biz#0842
Seems that might be most effective in ‚Äúefficiency vs security of funds‚Äù tradeoff


[14-Apr-21 12:23 PM] Biz#0842
But certainly open to other ideas


[14-Apr-21 12:26 PM] Biz#0842
I don‚Äôt know if n/m msig exists in KMD world - I am assuming it does. If only n/n is possible (as in docs @daemonfox  sent above), that eliminates ‚Äúefficiency‚Äù side of that tradeoff


[14-Apr-21 12:26 PM] Biz#0842
3/3 sounds fine to me also, though

adding a bool `true` as a second parameter generates the following error:

```error code: -26
error message:
16: mandatory-script-verify-flag-failed (Script evaluated without error but finished with a false/empty top stack element)
```


[14-Apr-21 04:52 PM] phm87#7395
```Please note that in this example, we are sending the whole deposited funds back, but in the case where you don't want to send all the amount, you have to manually specify a second (change) output. Because, by default the difference between inputs and outputs is counted as miner fee. Most probably you'll get the AcceptToMemoryPool: absurdly high fees error because of this reason. (This type of transaction can be allowed by using an additional parameter to the sendrawtransaction method set to true which actually sets allowhighfees=true, but it is very unlikely that you want to do it).```

Unfortunately, still getting error even when amount is raised for tx, or ‚Äútrue‚Äù is supplied as parameter.


[14-Apr-21 04:55 PM] Biz#0842
did manage to get the error to change once to ```error code: -26
error message:

but, i suspect that's probably cause I made tx amount too large for that one (didn't leave room for fee)

I'll give it a shot with 2/2 scheme

I'm having a look at google, other had same issues on BTC multisig but I didn't find clear answer yet (except change address and fee that you already tried)


[14-Apr-21 05:01 PM] Biz#0842
I do suspect this error is more indicative of whatever the problem is: `16: mandatory-script-verify-flag-failed (Script evaluated without error but finished with a false/empty top stack element)`. Maybe i'm using incorrect scriptPubKey values


[14-Apr-21 05:02 PM] Biz#0842
looks like some script condition isn't being fulfilled


[14-Apr-21 05:04 PM] Biz#0842
`OP_CHECKSIG` apparently doesn't error, but returns false as above implies happened


[14-Apr-21 05:25 PM] Mylo#8306
are you spending an unconfirmed utxo?


[14-Apr-21 06:51 PM] Biz#0842
Don‚Äôt believe so. Did this over the course of an hour, but can double check


[14-Apr-21 06:53 PM] Biz#0842
Tried a couple times, spending the same output in different ways


[14-Apr-21 07:41 PM] daemonfox#6136
@Alright i think you might now what is missing here as you directed me before to ask you before Collider locked up any coins.


[14-Apr-21 07:42 PM] daemonfox#6136
different lock i think but this multisig doc should be updated


[14-Apr-21 08:08 PM] Alright#0419
this^


[14-Apr-21 08:11 PM] Alright#0419
@Biz based on `absurdly high fees ` and `bad-txns-in-belowout`


[14-Apr-21 08:12 PM] Alright#0419
you're messing up the actual initial tx creation, not the signing


[14-Apr-21 08:12 PM] Alright#0419
`4995000` you tried to send a tx with `0.04995000` in miner fees and your client realized this was a mistake


[14-Apr-21 08:13 PM] Alright#0419
`bad-txns-in-belowout` you tried to send a tx with inputs < outputs


[14-Apr-21 08:13 PM] Biz#0842
So, I‚Äôve tried changing amounts around and have gotten past both those errors


[14-Apr-21 08:13 PM] Biz#0842
`mandatory script verify` one persists though


[14-Apr-21 08:14 PM] Alright#0419
dm the final tx you're trying to send


[14-Apr-21 08:14 PM] Alright#0419
you can look at the scriptsigs and see which keys signed and which didn't


[14-Apr-21 08:14 PM] Biz#0842
Sure, will do so as soon as I‚Äôm back at computer

Got the hang of it now. @daemonfox @phm87 let me know what arrangement you think would be best, for the donation address.  No one else at blur is running a KMD node, so it looks like i'll be the only signer from BLURworld

Good that you made it worked, I've never tried, I will test it. I will check that there are no offline scripts to do it because I think that it is possible without a full node. Maybe atomicDEX have the needed rpc commands


[15-Apr-21 01:17 PM] Biz#0842
am not sure about that, since I couldn't send to an msig address from ADex


[15-Apr-21 01:18 PM] Biz#0842
I am fine with just myself and you guys signing, but we should do a 3/3 in that event

yes 3/3 for now.

Got `OP_RETURN`decoding on BLUR fully written yesterday. Can decode scripts from Src and dest chains now. Will be adding those consensus rules today, and hopefully relaunching testnet by evening.


[16-Apr-21 12:05 PM] Biz#0842
I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll go the route of embedded a full KMD tx into a blur Tx. It seems to me that the script is all that needs embedded


[16-Apr-21 12:07 PM] Biz#0842
Store this value when `sendrawtransaction` is called, fetch from daemon RPC using `blur-notary-server-Rpc`, embed into blur tx, cross-reference embedded blur values on block addition containing these txs.


[16-Apr-21 12:12 PM] Biz#0842
We‚Äôll need to update testers keys to match those on KMD as a result. So we should go through keygen process if you all want to participate afterward @daemonfox @metaphilibert @dth88

Keep your wallets for now.  Seed nodes will be going down and back up periodically until I get things updated & relaunched.


[13-May-21 12:16 PM] Biz#0842
**We have relaunched the BLUR testnet.  Please do not connect to the test network with a previously used data directory!**

We need to reset the chain from zero, with new consensus changes.  Remove your data directory entirely with a `rm -r ~/.blurnetwork`.  I have a backup of the old chain should we need it for any reason.  If you do not remove the database first, your node will immediately be blocked by nodes currently in sync.  This will make it headache for you to get reconnected promptly, as I'll have to unban IP in question on all active nodes.

Cmake 3.14+ no longer required, as I removed libhydrogen dependency. Hydrogen was only being used for secure wipes and random buffer generation. Switched over to Monero utils to perform the same functions.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî


[02-Aug-21 02:59 PM] Biz#0842
@kolo currently BLUR NN key generation does not consider the leading byte on BTC pubkey (I.e. `02`/`03`)‚Ä¶ do you see this presenting any problems in practice? If so, we can hash the 33-byte pubkey


[02-Aug-21 03:01 PM] Biz#0842
Daemonfox mentioned we are losing some information on secp265k1 EC points with the truncation. I‚Äôm unsure if this information loss is particularly meaningful in this instance‚Ä¶. as viewkeys do not impact ability to spend coins on BLUR. BTC pubkeys are not tied in any way to the spendkey generation; only viewkey generation (which is intended to be easily reproduced for visibility of transactions)


[02-Aug-21 03:02 PM] Biz#0842
@Alright @Decker if either of you can weigh in on question to kolo, that would be helpful as well


[02-Aug-21 03:06 PM] Biz#0842
Full 33-byte BTC pubkeys are considered when generating script values for iguana, but nowhere else.


[02-Aug-21 03:07 PM] Biz#0842
If anything is ambiguous please feel free to ask questions


[02-Aug-21 11:10 PM] hastrup#8742
@Biz  how big should the node be? Min req?


[02-Aug-21 11:10 PM] hastrup#8742
I'm trying it out later today


[02-Aug-21 11:21 PM] Biz#0842
For comfortable compilation with more than 2 threads on `make`, have >8GB of mem. Aside from compiling, extremely light requirements.


[02-Aug-21 11:22 PM] Biz#0842
Komodo‚Äôs daemon and iguana are the heavy parts, so budget specs to run those + 1 more lighter daemon


[02-Aug-21 11:55 PM] hastrup#8742
So 4t 16gb and 50gb space is allright?


[02-Aug-21 11:56 PM] hastrup#8742
@Biz


[03-Aug-21 12:00 AM] Biz#0842
Yep, that should work


[03-Aug-21 06:57 AM] Biz#0842
~~I‚Äôll consolidate setup to a script, today.~~ But keygen must be done manually, because spendkeys are unique each time process is performed

Anything above -j2 may cause memory exhaustion on anything around 8GB of memory without swap space. So I default to that to minimize problems for others

-j4 should work just fine with 16GB

im about to make a btc nativ wallet so i can get the pubkey. where is a good way to get bootstrap? both dexstats and chain stats is down or dont have it any more


[08-Aug-21 09:50 AM] Biz#0842
You do not need a BTC native wallet. Just use a Komodo daemon/wallet. Pubkey is chain-agnostic


[08-Aug-21 09:51 AM] Biz#0842
We will be notarizing to LTC, not Bitcoin anyway. But all of these chains use the same elliptic curves, so same 33-byte pubkey.


[08-Aug-21 09:51 AM] Biz#0842
Blur uses different elliptic curves, which is part of why pubkeys are different for CN/XMR world


[08-Aug-21 09:53 AM] hastrup#8742
so if im on the config pubkey in the guide i shuld have the kmd deamon ready to go?


[08-Aug-21 09:53 AM] hastrup#8742
or do i need to make a kmd nativ somewhere else?


[08-Aug-21 10:00 AM] Biz#0842
I‚Äôm not sure I understand the question. You can use any KMD pubkey to which you have a corresponding private key


[08-Aug-21 10:00 AM] Biz#0842
Whether you choose to set up a new one, or use an existing one is up to you. Private key is in no way disclosed to BLUR


[08-Aug-21 10:08 AM] hastrup#8742
I have made a blur node and gone through the steps. Can I have a kmd deamon running on that node also? Or do I need to make a new node whit my nativ wallet


[08-Aug-21 10:09 AM] Biz#0842
Both daemons should be running on the same server

[08-Aug-21 10:43 AM] hastrup#8742
idk how to start the chain and to get the pubkey

normally i start the deamon with screen and run this to get kmd up

cd ~
cd komodo
./src/komodod -addnode=78.47.196.146 -daemon

but my folder is named dpow-blur and in src i cant find any komodod


[08-Aug-21 11:12 AM] Biz#0842
You need to compile komodo separately. It does not compile with blur

@Biz hey sorry I missed your mention. Do you still need advice regarding the keys? I don't quite understand the question


[10-Aug-21 06:36 AM] Biz#0842
Nope, came to the conclusion that it wasn‚Äôt necessary. Also changed setup flow to handle the 33-byte keys.

Basically 32 bytes of those are used to seed viewkey generation. I wanted to make sure dropping that leading `02/03` (first byte) wouldn‚Äôt impact things. But I‚Äôm now confident it‚Äôs fine in this context
