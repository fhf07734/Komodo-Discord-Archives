just a heads up, after discussing a specific usecase today, I coded the Payments CC with methods: txidopret, create, list, info, fund, release
validation isnt done yet, but that shouldnt take long once the rpc calls are debugged. just a heads up so there are no complaints about being blind sided by a new CC.
payments CC allows to define a fixed allocation of incoming funds. the destination addresses can be however many normal scriptPubKeys and one that needs an opreturn. if more than one opreturn is needed, then a chain of payments CC creates can be created, one per opreturn.
The usecase this was for was a smartchain that wanted to fund X amount to founders reward and the rest to rewards CC. the rewards CC needs an opreturn, so things got a bit more complex than you would expect.
total time so far: 8 hours
all the rpc calls have been tested in the easy cases, all that is left is the validation and to make sure the non-zero param cases and opreturn in the paymentsrelease is working properly

fixed all the reported bugs and it works now with a single opreturn destination


[22-Mar-19 03:19 AM] jl777c#5810
also changed it so it payouts out a minimum of a 0.0001 to all destinations, this might create a small subsidy but simplifies validation

with a minimum payout set, it will create a predictable vout vector

@jl777c the additional 0.0001 vout isn't accounted for in inputs it seems


[22-Mar-19 03:28 AM] Alright#0419
Oh it must use the the paymentfund utxos as inputs


[22-Mar-19 03:29 AM] Alright#0419
so it must be subtracted from one of the other outputs?

if it's simply a marker, you could make it a CC vout with value of 0 I believe


[22-Mar-19 03:31 AM] Alright#0419
this way you don't need to subtract 0.0001 from another vout


[22-Mar-19 03:31 AM] jl777c#5810
we need to be able to extract the pubkey from the vout


[22-Mar-19 03:31 AM] jl777c#5810
a CC vout is mostly a hash


[22-Mar-19 03:32 AM] jl777c#5810
i add inputs for newamount +2*txfee


[22-Mar-19 03:33 AM] Alright#0419
problem is that the inputs are limited by the paymentsfund utxos


[22-Mar-19 03:33 AM] Alright#0419
it can't just grab any random utxo to spend


[22-Mar-19 03:33 AM] Alright#0419
Does that make sense? Like if we're splitting the payentfund utxos 1:2 to two separate vouts, we need to subtract the 0.0001 from one of them, no?


[22-Mar-19 03:34 AM] jl777c#5810
or it means there needs to be 5.0002 in inputs available


[22-Mar-19 03:35 AM] jl777c#5810
what was the sum of vouts for that tx? vs size of vins?

[22-Mar-19 03:40 AM] Alright#0419
I think that assumes there always will be a change vout


[22-Mar-19 03:41 AM] Alright#0419
spending the exact amount would lead to the same vin vout mismatch I think


[22-Mar-19 03:41 AM] jl777c#5810
i think it is ok as the bug was that i was miscalculating change


[22-Mar-19 03:51 AM] Alright#0419
@jl777c I believe it doesn't pay a tx fee now


[22-Mar-19 03:51 AM] Alright#0419
I was able to do a `paymentsrelease` and it paid a 1 sat tx fee because of the rounding on the ratio split


[22-Mar-19 03:52 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, off by one. pushed fix


[22-Mar-19 04:11 AM] jl777c#5810
@Deleted User after you get the validation sorted, what do you think about adding a dividends payment method? The idea is to use token balances to allocate a total amount. You can use getsnapshot code to get a complete list of balances in addresses, then for each one would need to do a CCtoken_balance to filter out the ones with non-zero tokenbalance. Summing all the satoshis for the token gets the denominator to use to allocate the funded amount. I dont think it should be a consensus involved rpc, just a way to issue a dividend of X amount of coins to the token holders. Having an exclude list of addresses would be a practical thing.


[22-Mar-19 04:12 AM] jl777c#5810
once something like this works, maybe a filename can be specified that has the output of a getsnapshot call. that way people could do airdrops to a coin by doing a getsnapshot > file, then a paymentsdividend [file,amount,dustlevel,excluded addresses]


[22-Mar-19 04:13 AM] jl777c#5810
iguana has something like this it you need an example


[22-Mar-19 04:15 AM] jl777c#5810
another utility that would be handy would be to convert a getsnapshot output into a set of paymentstxidopret tx and a paymentscreate for each group of 255 (about the max that will fit). Then it would need to make a "linked list" of paymentcreates where the first one is to 255 address + createtxid for the second, the second would have the same with createtxid CC address for the third, etc. until it reaches the end.


[22-Mar-19 04:16 AM] jl777c#5810
A bit of tricky calculation to figure out how much the linkd list allocation is (should be sum of all the remaining txidoprets) for each createtxid


[22-Mar-19 04:18 AM] jl777c#5810
once this is setup, then a single payment to the initial payments CC address should allow a dividend payment to be released and by sorting the payout addresses to the largest first, then the amounts get smaller and smaller at each stage. so at some point it wont be big enough for a minimum, but this will track things precisely (other than the 0,0001 rounding)


[22-Mar-19 04:19 AM] jl777c#5810
It seems possible to convert a cashflow allocation to a set of paymentscreate definitions, so even a spreadsheet to payments CC "compiler" would be possible


[22-Mar-19 05:01 AM] jl777c#5810
generating tx with 64 to 256 payments will be able to complete airdrops with not so many tx

payments CC is a result of total dev hours of about 6 hrs for first iteration and may be about another 6 hrs for debugging, and then maybe few more hours to what it is now.


[22-Mar-19 05:53 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
As I read stuff and calculate it 🤔


[22-Mar-19 05:54 AM] jl777c#5810
more like 10hrs total so far for me, not counting testing time and review time. plus validation is totally missing


[22-Mar-19 05:54 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm still unclear what payments CC does


[22-Mar-19 05:54 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the example use case I mean


[22-Mar-19 05:55 AM] jl777c#5810
allows to blockchain enforce payment allocations


[22-Mar-19 05:55 AM] jl777c#5810
say you have an agreement to share income 10%, 10%, 40%, 40% across 4 receivers


[22-Mar-19 05:55 AM] jl777c#5810
you can define this and then funds can be sent to a single address knowning that the exact percentages will be paid out


[22-Mar-19 05:56 AM] jl777c#5810
very useful for businesses that need to share a single source of income across different groups


[22-Mar-19 05:56 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
aha.... a part of the decentralized organization's funds management!


[22-Mar-19 05:56 AM] jl777c#5810
or you can make a onetime payment CC to do an airdrop

[22-Mar-19 05:57 AM] jl777c#5810
it arose from a usecase where the founders reward for the blockchain needed to partially fund a rewards CC


[22-Mar-19 05:57 AM] jl777c#5810
but I generalized it from that

@jl777c What do you think the best way for initializing a chain that uses a ac_script paying to payments CC is? I just started a chain that does it, but the only way to sync it is to boostrap block 1


[23-Mar-19 10:44 AM] Alright#0419
an exception for this block 1 magic check? a height activated ac_script maybe?


[23-Mar-19 11:01 AM] jl777c#5810
get the payments CC vout from one instance of the chain, then start a new chain with that, it wont change if it is paying to the 'opret' form of 'F'


[23-Mar-19 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
@Deleted User that is why we needed the opreturn form of payment, so we can make an -ac_script chain that doesnt have a txid dependency


[23-Mar-19 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
so we cant deprecate the opreturn form of the 'F' funding tx


[24-Mar-19 11:21 AM] jl777c#5810
and we also need to add a -mineropreturn komodod arg to make the miner add an opreturn


[24-Mar-19 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
set -ac_founders to > 10, then you have 10 blocks to create the payments CC to get the createtxid that allows to know the opreturn needed. just do a fund with opretflag and extract the opreturn


[24-Mar-19 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
use that for -mineropreturn and use the CC vout for the -ac_script


[24-Mar-19 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
restart the daemon


[24-Mar-19 11:23 AM] jl777c#5810
at the founders reward it will fund the payments CC and then you can do a release as per the createtxid was made


[24-Mar-19 12:49 PM] Alright#0419
Still trying to figure this out. How can I ensure the 1of2 CC address will be the same on the new ac_script chain?


[24-Mar-19 01:17 PM] jl777c#5810
because the useopret form of Fund sends to the global CC address, always the same


[24-Mar-19 01:17 PM] jl777c#5810
it is like faucetfund is always having the same CC vout


[24-Mar-19 02:24 PM] Alright#0419
@jl777c @Deleted User there seems to be an off by 1 error in the validation code because of the rounding on the ratio split. If you do the minimum release amount and the ratio drops 1 sat in the rounding, it gives this error

[24-Mar-19 11:59 PM] jl777c#5810
useopret is to make opret spends possible so you can have an -ac_script and -mineropret options for a chain to solve the initial usecase that started this


[24-Mar-19 11:59 PM] jl777c#5810
we also need to make sure the excess mining fees cant be used to trick the CC


[25-Mar-19 12:00 AM] jl777c#5810
and maybe other CC are vulnerable to that trick too?

I have a quyestion about the rounding error. Reading over this channel again, you guys were changing the code that did the tx fee stuff.. Is it possible that the tx on the PAY chain that is failing was a result of the changes at that time?
I am really struggling with this one thing, as the code in the RPC and the validation is exactly the same. Doesnt make any sense why the result comes out diffrent.


[25-Mar-19 01:23 AM] jl777c#5810
PAY originally didnt have the txidpk vout, but there was no validation at first. it is possible we need to do height activation on  PAY, or maybe just make a new chain for clean testing with all the latest


[25-Mar-19 01:23 AM] jl777c#5810
if new tx all validate, then likely it is just a historical issue


[25-Mar-19 01:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think that may be the case. With the new validation for op return spending I think validation is complete.,.. but I havent not enforced a couple of returns as errors because it stops PAY syncing.

lets just make a new chain for clean testing. also alright found some miner attack with giant txfee

maybe allocation should become an int64_t ? seems saving a bit of space is not worth it if we end up with rounding errors and the txidopret is using int32_t


[25-Mar-19 03:11 AM] jl777c#5810
since we need to make a new chain anyway, might as well just break backward compatibility


[25-Mar-19 03:11 AM] jl777c#5810
so I vote for int64_t all around for all allocation variables


[25-Mar-19 03:18 AM] jl777c#5810
@Deleted User can you make pull request for converting to int64?

merged. ok, so now it should be all good. though do we have protection from Alright evil miner attack?


[25-Mar-19 03:42 AM] jl777c#5810
all spends from global addresses or 1of2 address with global address being one of the 1of2, is subject to this one where the miner makes a giant txfee and reduces the output


[25-Mar-19 03:42 AM] jl777c#5810
so the payment amount would be reduced and match all the ratios but 99% of the funds going to the txfee


[25-Mar-19 03:44 AM] Deleted User#0000
not sure we have fixed that no ... I still dont quite understand it, will try to sort that tomorrow, have whole day reserved for work.


[25-Mar-19 03:47 AM] jl777c#5810
should just be a matter to make sure the txfee is 10000 sats


[25-Mar-19 03:47 AM] jl777c#5810
so sum of vins - sum of outputs == 10000

@Alright  @Exile13  
I have got payments CC working to be paid by the miner. My parameters of my plans in this chain are stupid, but the important thing to do was to fund the contracts. You can use the notes here as a guide to create your own chains:
https://github.com/blackjok3rtt/komodo/blob/489485252b68597bc9173328ed21674b58f90b8b/src/cc/hempcoin_notes.txt
The branch you need for now is: `git clone https://github.com/blackjok3rtt/komodo.git -b jl777` 
I will merge this to jls repo once it has had some more testing. I think I covered every base, such as creating diffrent ac_script/ac_pubkey chains to make sure all coinbases were paid to the right pubkeys etc, but its possible I have missed something, its been a long 2 days. 
You can sync the chain I created in the example with that branch by running the following command:
`./komodod -ac_name=TESTHC -ac_supply=1000000 -ac_reward=100000000000 -ac_cc=2 -ac_script=2ea22c8020987fad30df055db6fd922c3a57e55d76601229ed3da3b31340112e773df3d0d28103120c008203000401ccb8 -ac_founders=150 -ac_blocktime=20 -ac_nk=96,5 -earlytxid=810bd62fb8353fad20267ff2050684b8829affa3edf6b366633931530791dfce -addnode=103.6.12.112`
Please test rewards contract works,  and try your own `paymentsrelease` transactions to verify those continue to work. Then make a new chain with better more sane rewards contract and chain parameters.

few minor issues to iron out... While thinking about how Alright would try to break it... I tried my own test, of making an aiur drop tx, sending it before the next snapshot happens, then mining empty blocks with it stuck in mempool until the next snapshot happens (after sending coins) so the airdroip is now invalid.. 
And it did what I thaught it would, and got stuck in the mempool of the miner, preventing it from mining blocks. I think I found solution though, just remove the tx from mempool when it is rejected by CC_EVAL... as its  difficult to make a payments airdrop TX and this "attack vector" (which can happen by accident dure to network latency etc) can only happen once a day, I think this method will work just fine. Testing this stuff is time consuming... But Better do it properly than have it break later after we build stuff on top of it.

This cc would eliminate a majority of my headache for the coin I’m trying to design to reward various offchain efforts like boinc .  With a little more complexity like using oracles to pull APIs  and some function for proportional distribution ( vs. set percentage talked about above )  DAOs are on the horizon .

[29-Apr-19 07:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
If you want to discuss or suggest any features for it hit me up man @polycryptoblog , I'm trying to design it so that we can easily build on top of it with new stuff. So far it handles, a set % to a set of addresses, and it also does a daily snapshot of the entire chain and saves the top 5000 addresses, of which you can supply a list of addresses to ignore, and select your chosen top amount.


[29-Apr-19 09:36 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Deleted User About to get some sleep right now but will definitely message you tomorrow  with some ideas.  I’ve been thinking how to handle payments manually I can convert those ideas to descriptions of onchain mechanisms. This cc I see becoming ubiquitous.


[29-Apr-19 11:03 PM] jl777c#5810
yes with snapshot capability, decentralized autonomous org (DAO) is as easy as having a profit/fee making service payout to the snapshot address


[29-Apr-19 11:04 PM] jl777c#5810
@Deleted User we need to be able to specify the minimum amount that can be used for a payment release


[29-Apr-19 11:04 PM] Deleted User#0000
that is already there? Pretty sure


[29-Apr-19 11:04 PM] jl777c#5810
then anybody can generate the tx when there is more than that


[29-Apr-19 11:05 PM] jl777c#5810
i havent looked at all the parameters, so if already there that is good. A min/max amount per address is also useful


[29-Apr-19 11:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
I have exclude address, min relaeasre, locked blocks, top address to pay. Its done is such a way that adding extra params isnt hard, but will be hard forking to any existing chains.. which right now is zero. So getting eveything needed soon is a very good idea.


[29-Apr-19 11:07 PM] jl777c#5810
in case of min/max you probably have to iterate the payout calculation to get it to spend close to the specified amount


[29-Apr-19 11:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
min/max seems fairly difficult really, harder than the rest of the things.


[29-Apr-19 11:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
btw the max sigops is 4000, so we can only fo 3999 vouts per tx


[29-Apr-19 11:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
I was thinking maybe an opposite to top param, so that the plan could be divided into 2, so we can pay ~8000 address, but it means the funding has to come from 2 places.


[29-Apr-19 11:22 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe then there can be payoutindex, where it can specified the nth 4000 address groups, for chains with many addresses


[29-Apr-19 11:23 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a dustthreshold? either for source or destination amount


[29-Apr-19 11:23 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess a fixed payout to the top N addresses would be useful and easy to calculate


[29-Apr-19 11:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
not really... currentlyit just truncates anything under 5000 address.


[29-Apr-19 11:24 PM] jl777c#5810
you said the time to do changes is now, before any chain uses it


[29-Apr-19 11:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
dust threshold didnt save any time. in my testing so I just left it out.


[29-Apr-19 11:24 PM] Deleted User#0000

[30-Apr-19 02:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
```To add to snapshot parameters:
    - miniumum amount that can be paid to an address. why max? as you can just do multiple releases and bypass it.
    - diffrent pay out that pays static amount to top N address. 
    - change 5000 address limitation to dust threshold parameter?
    - extra RPC to merge all payments utxos to a single utxo, wihtout letting someone constantly DOS spend it. some threshold of utxos allows this to happen? 
    - second "top" param so a range of address can be paid, rather than just the top. 
        -could be used to pay more than 3999 address, but no way to stop someone paying bottom address over and over wihtout some extra protections, of some kind, unsolved problem.
    - work out the maximum number exclude scriptpubkeys. (maybe just check op_return size on plan create? )```


[30-Apr-19 02:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
come up with these. Most of them are simple additions.


[30-Apr-19 02:31 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems maybe it is enough to pay the top 4000 addresses

@dimxy  
https://github.com/blackjok3rtt/komodo/blob/jl777/src/cc/payments.cpp#L434
Any chance you can check this code for me? for some strange reason the bignum stuff is returning two diffrent values, in RPC and validation. There was a bug that was not doing this rtest properly, and basically allowing any number though. It was only just found. When trying to fix it, I can no longer make payments release txns. 

Flow is in RPC:
1) add all address balances together in RPC to get `mpzTotalAllocations` (this matches validation) 
2) set the allocation for the address in RPC to `mpzValue` 
3) multiply mpzValue with the amount to be released
4) divide this with the `mpzTotalAllocations`  to get the vout nValue. 

Flow in Validation:
1) Check change is in vout 1, and also check txfee amount. 
2) subtract the change and txfee paid from the total tx valueout to get the total amount paid to the actual recipients.  (this matches check prints) 
3)  multiply the balance of the address with the total amount paid (checkamount)
4) Divide this number by the total allocations

they differ by a percentage it seems, with smaller amounts it is usually 1 sat, but when I do large airdrops its out by a lot more.

If you need to send to a.crypto condition script pubkey that requires an opreturn to be valid the hex goes there

Does that make sense?


[19-Jun-19 03:55 AM] gcharang#6833
~~is it for funding faucet, rewards, heir etc.,?
what is the hex that goes there?~~


[19-Jun-19 05:24 AM] gcharang#6833
I think I get it
```
the value of "destopret" is used in the opreturn of the transaction that sends the coins to the scriptpubkey 
if the scriptpubkey belongs to a CC that expects a opret in the txn that sends coins to it, then destopret will be used by it
```
@Deleted User 
correct me if I am wrong


[19-Jun-19 06:28 AM] Deleted User#0000
yes seems correct. 
Basically it was designed for paymentsCC to pay a rewardsCC plan, which requires an op_return attacced to its funding transaction. Other wise funds sent there would be burnt, as the rewards plan wouldnt know what plan the fund were for.
