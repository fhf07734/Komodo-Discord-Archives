**Weekly Update - January 24, 2019** 
First off, thanks to all of you for joining the Komodo Community Portal in this initial soft launch period! We're grateful to have so many supportive people within our community.¬†

The full launch of the Komodo Community Portal will be on February 3. Until then, please provide us with feedback about how we can improve the portal experience before opening it up to the public. We also encourage you to post your thoughts and questions about blockchain technology! You can post original content or you can post articles, blogs, infographics, podcasts, and videos related to blockchain, as well as other interesting and fun stuff. Making quality content available within the portal is crucial to keeping the user experience top-notch. ¬†

As some of you probably noticed, the Komodo marketing team did not send out the weekly newsletter last Friday. That's because, as one of our adjustments for 2020, we will be switching to a monthly format for the newsletter.

We will still post a weekly update to the community but, rather than sending it out to the email list, we will publish it right here on the community portal. The Komodo team is committed to keeping the community informed about developments and happenings with the project so we do want to continue putting information out weekly. At the same time, we want to populate the portal with useful content and increase engagement with our email marketing efforts by sending newsletters that are less frequent but of much higher quality.¬†

**Weekly Update - January 31, 2020** 
As mentioned in last week's update, the full launch of the Komodo Community Portal will be this coming Monday, February 3. The Komodo team would still appreciate any feedback you may have about how we can improve the portal experience before the full launch.¬†

Remember that you can post original content or any external articles, blogs, infographics, podcasts, and videos that you find interesting. Let's make sure the portal is active and full of informative content before the wider public starts joining next week!

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Along with the public launch of the community portal, the Komodo team will publish the 2019 year-end report and Komodo's strategic objectives for 2020 this coming Monday, February 3. The announcement for the Fourth Annual Notary Node Election will also be published on Monday. The team will be putting the finishing touches on everything over the weekend and pushing everything out on Monday morning, so keep an eye out for all these important updates!
