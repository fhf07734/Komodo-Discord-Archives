Hi guys,  are there more informations than the official doc on the token CC features : https://docs.komodoplatform.com/cc/contracts/tokens/rpc-index.html or is there an existing project that us this CC. As I understand, it work like colored coin on Bitcoin (openassets and co), but I'm not sure ! 😃


[18-Dec-18 03:06 AM] jl777c#5810
yes you can issue tokens


[18-Dec-18 03:06 AM] jl777c#5810
tokenaddress [pubkey]
tokenask numtokens tokenid price
tokenbalance tokenid [pubkey]
tokenbid numtokens tokenid price
tokencancelask tokenid asktxid
tokencancelbid tokenid bidtxid
tokenconvert evalcode tokenid pubkey amount
tokencreate name supply description
tokenfillask tokenid asktxid fillunits
tokenfillbid tokenid bidtxid fillamount
tokeninfo tokenid
tokenlist
tokenorders [tokenid]
tokentransfer tokenid destpubkey amount


[18-Dec-18 03:07 AM] jl777c#5810
those are the rpc calls, it has DEX functionality also


[18-Dec-18 03:07 AM] jl777c#5810
there are some test scripts, but those and the C code are all the docs that exist

@Meyse can also hang out in this channel to ask about assets CC queries


[15-Jan-19 05:34 PM] Mylo#8306
@Mihailo @dimxy hi 👋 
I hear there’s some updates to assetsCC happening soon.
Will they be testable at end of month?  I want to write a tutorial for an article around the time of a conference mid feb.

Just wanted to know if RPC methods will be similar


[15-Jan-19 09:07 PM] jl777c#5810
pretty sure the rpc methods will be the same, the changes were internal, unless i missed external facing changes


[15-Jan-19 09:30 PM] Mylo#8306
cool thanks


[15-Jan-19 10:13 PM] dimxy#2587
hi, 
yes I hope the updates will be ready before the end of Jan

👍 

[16-Jan-19 02:53 AM] Mihailo#5902
And I think RPC is 100% same.


[20-Jan-19 06:14 AM] dimxy#2587
@Mylo  just to let you know that we merged assets into FSM and it is being tested now.

Ok thanks @dimxy I’ll watch this week


[28-Jan-19 03:11 AM] TonyL#3577
After one of the latest (but already after tokens/assets CC split) updates it's possible to generate `tokencancelbid` and `tokencancelbid` for "not my" orders cancelling   (before there was an error on transaction generation stage so tests detected it) @dimxy

@Mihailo  Seems there is "continue" instead of "return ("") in FinalizeCCTx, after "CC signing error: vini.%d has unknown CC address.(%s)\n"?


[28-Jan-19 03:31 AM] Mihailo#5902
@dimxy, I have fixed that but it may be that in all branches we worked on it was lost...

                    return("");
                }```


[28-Jan-19 03:35 AM] Mihailo#5902
@TonyL As I see it is not possible to cancel ask/bid that is not yours. But you are saying that RPC function is passing and it should not? Because it is failing on broadcast...


[28-Jan-19 03:37 AM] TonyL#3577
@Mihailo It's not possible to cancel (error on broadcast as shown above) but possible to generate such tx now

@jl777c What is the purpose of pubkeys in FinalizeCCTx?


[28-Jan-19 05:21 AM] jl777c#5810
it is to allow passing in a vector of pubkeys (one for each vin) and having it automatically check for 1of2 addresses


[28-Jan-19 05:24 AM] Mihailo#5902
Cool, and in which CC is the use case?


[28-Jan-19 05:25 AM] jl777c#5810
marmara


[28-Jan-19 05:25 AM] jl777c#5810
it needs to be able to spend from potentially hundreds of different 1of2 CC addrs using the global address, but it needs to have an address to compare to


[28-Jan-19 05:26 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe i didnt understand the control flow that was needed when i added it


[28-Jan-19 05:27 AM] Mihailo#5902
Ok, don't know how MarmaraCC works 😉


[28-Jan-19 05:29 AM] jl777c#5810
it is still evolving, but i needed that functionality and I guess I added it in incorrectly


[28-Jan-19 05:30 AM] Mihailo#5902
Np, you didn't added it incorrectly just when merging you pulled in old line of code 😉


[28-Jan-19 05:34 AM] jl777c#5810
so its broken now, or is it fixed with latest?


[28-Jan-19 05:34 AM] Mihailo#5902
I fixed it with last PR.

As I remember before `tokenorders` displayed all tokenorders available on chain so it's probably a bug @dimxy @jl777c

@jorian can you give the steps it takes to reproduce this?


[04-Mar-19 12:49 PM] jorian#4555
was about to do it. so TLDR: i set up my own chain, nothing fancy: `-ac_supply=5000` and `-ac_cc=9898`. mined the supply on node 2, sent a part to node 1, where i put up a bid for a new token i created on node 2. on this node, i created the token on addy A, and on the same node created a new address/pubkey where i sent a part of the tokens to, in order to sell them to node 1.

@Mihailo  this is PreventCC function which does not take into account that it could be cc change in tokens in vout.4.
And it is set that vout.4+ are not cc vouts.  Do we need this PreventCC call at the bottom as we already checked all vouts?

looking at this again, I think this may need to be changed
```
    if (params.size() == 4)    {
        nonfungibleData = ParseHex(params[3].get_str());
        if (nonfungibleData.size() > 10000) // opret limit
        {
            ERR_RESULT("Non-fungible data must be <= 10000");
            return(result);
}```


[08-Mar-19 08:22 PM] Alright#0419
@Mihailo @dimxy this is just checking that the non-fungible data is less than 10000


[08-Mar-19 08:22 PM] Alright#0419
the non-fungible data is not the only thing stored in OP_RETURN, so in reality this limit is a little bit less than 10000, yes?


[08-Mar-19 08:24 PM] Mylo#8306
ouch....  what about using constants ?


[08-Mar-19 09:33 PM] dimxy#2587
constants are great.
As to non-fungible data size, we could not define its exact limit, because it is floating as there may be different data kinds in the opret.  Together they all will be limited by the total opret size 10000. 
So here we just checking in advance that non-fungible data size is not too big


[08-Mar-19 11:47 PM] Mylo#8306
ok.  wouldn't a komodo_defs.h `OPRETURN_MAXSIZE=10000` still be better, to save an inadvertant vim/rushed/late-night typo of 10000 vs 1000 vs 100000, and across any future CCs (plus establish a best practise)?   txfee is 10000 through that file a fair few times.

Just asking, i'd be happy to do it if it is useful?


[08-Mar-19 11:49 PM] Mylo#8306
the comment //opret limit wouldn't need to be there either.
If an ac would want larger opreturn, they could modify in komodo_defs much easier (presuming the codebase adopts it in the future).


[08-Mar-19 11:49 PM] jl777c#5810
yes it would be better, i think it is a defined variable somewhere

If you're curious to know what CC documentation looks like when finished, so as to get idea of what we need for this module, take a look at any of the modules here:

not sure if it's a bug in the documentation or in the RPC call

`komodo-cli .... tokencreate TOKA 0.0001 "short description"` works

but using curl need to wrap the supply (number) in a string https://gist.github.com/imylomylo/b983a89e78cf65abe98a229c1267698a#error

In python client I wrap supply by `"` as well
Should be a bug in documentation (RPC args should be a string - bug in the RPC should be if RPC arg is not string)

I've ran into quite a few examples of this behavior


[12-May-19 08:30 AM] Alright#0419
never really thought about it, just worked around it when rpc tells me it expected a string


[12-May-19 08:30 AM] Alright#0419
not all args are strings


[12-May-19 08:35 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm about CCs calls, not sure about others - there was huge inconsistency on some point and if I remember correct James proposed/recommended to use everywhere strings


[12-May-19 08:36 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe some args where only int is expecting can accept int, not sure


[12-May-19 12:15 PM] dimxy#2587
I think this is because in this rpc call the rpc param client conversion feature in rpc/client.cpp is not used, so all params are considered as strings (and if needed, converted into numbers inside the rpc call. So for curl they are all strings).
As I can see most of our cc rpc calls do not use client conversion either. If they do we could pass number params as numbers. The methods that use this  are listed in client.cpp.
We may decide if we should use this conversion for all developers


[12-May-19 12:19 PM] dimxy#2587
Probably to make our docs consistent (where params are described as they are: number as numbers, strings as strings ) we should use the client conversion.


[12-May-19 07:39 PM] Mylo#8306
ah damn.  sounds a bit messy.  now i understand why @Bryan_Beus skipped the curl exampels for CC and stuck with the command line - CLI sounds like consistent behaviour to document.   curl commands - seem to be all strings.
this will be quite annoying for the RPC wrapper developers, but once the wrappers are written, GUI devs wont have a problem.


[12-May-19 07:41 PM] Mylo#8306
```
komodo-cli -regtest -ac_name=MYCOIN tokencreate TOKENF "0.0005" "token g"

this worked for me, using supply as a string for cli (& curl)

does response in curl also come back with repeated "result" in json.  `{ "result": { "result": "success", "hex": "......."}` or are my early morning eyes deceiving me?


[12-May-19 08:21 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
In the docs, we should use whatever a developer would want to use during production.

We used komodo-cli earlier, because with curl I kept running into bug issues and couldn't afford to wait. I believe dukeleto solved many, if not all, of the bugs I came across back then.


[12-May-19 08:21 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
You guys tell me, is curl better than komodo-cli?


[12-May-19 08:28 PM] Mylo#8306
yeah curl for devs.   komodo-cli has done it's job for getting docs to where it is, but it's time curl took over 😃


[12-May-19 08:29 PM] Mylo#8306
a non-sidd question here:
https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/customconsensus/tokens.html#tokenorders
what happened to `tokenorders` with no tokenid.    seems `tokenid` is required now.

@Mylo 
as far as I observed, the cc related RPC have all args as strings
In the older (btc based  etc.,) ones args that are numbers don't need quotes
see second bullet in https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/python-rpc-komodod.html#usage
as dimxy said
```
12:45 AM] dimxy: I think this is because in this rpc call the rpc param client conversion feature in rpc/client.cpp is not used, so all params are considered as strings (and if needed, converted into numbers inside the rpc call. So for curl they are all strings).
As I can see most of our cc rpc calls do not use client conversion either. If they do we could pass number params as numbers. The methods that use this  are listed in client.cpp.
We may decide if we should use this conversion for all developers

might be there are similar ones written for BTC in js or other languages that can be easily appropriated

And there no any adjustment needed for `slick-rpc` client @gcharang since it's just usual client-server connection actually which wrap and send standartized JSON request and doing the same with response (it using pycurl and ujson).
Initially I just input rpcpassword, rpcuser and port and started to make calls - no any adjustments needed


[13-May-19 07:21 AM] TonyL#3577
Actually it should work with any btc fork which using quite standart config and request/response scheme


[13-May-19 07:22 AM] gcharang#6833
yeah no adjustments needed, just input the rpcuser/pass and port to the function, as shown in the example in the doc

[13-May-19 07:27 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh you pinned - actually I've not checked if it works and/or works same way - just googled `programming_language + bitcoinrpc` and pasted first link
But examples in readmes looks like it should work


[13-May-19 07:35 AM] gcharang#6833
It's ok, it is just so that it won't get lost
later people familiar with the different languages should check if each of them will work

`case 1` offer to buy tokens with price 0.08880000 each for 8.88000000 max, so totalrequired 100 tokens to fill this order (8.88000000 / 0.08880000 = 100)
`case 2` offer to sell 1000 tokens with 0.1111 price each so 0.11110000 * 1000 = 111.10000000
case3 is the same as case2


[14-May-19 09:50 AM] TonyL#3577
@Mylo


[14-May-19 09:51 AM] Mylo#8306
yes.  why is amount on the buy 8.88 but on teh sell it's 1000?


[14-May-19 09:51 AM] Mylo#8306
is one coin one token, depending on if it's a buy or sell?


[14-May-19 09:52 AM] Mylo#8306
`amount` is confusing because it flips. . but docs don't describe it well enough (imo)


[14-May-19 09:52 AM] dimxy#2587
for buy you are actually 'selling' your coins for tokens that s why amount in coins
for sell you selling your tokens for  coins - amount in tokens

[23-May-19 07:24 AM] TonyL#3577
Hi @akiii 
https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/customconsensus/tokens.html
Here you can find tokens documentation

Actually make NFT is very simple, all you need is to create a token with supply 1, for it you have to use 1 satoshi as input (second argument of tokencreate call):
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=HELLOWORLD tokencreate MYTOKEN 0.00000001 "My very own NFT token."```

@TonyL but if i want for example create 100 MYTOKEN but all different description it is possible ?


[23-May-19 07:27 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, it's possible to create token with any supply/description you want. But in case of supply > 1 it'll be not NFT


[23-May-19 07:29 AM] TonyL#3577
Just FYI, limitations are: 
32 symbols for token name
4096 for token description


[23-May-19 07:29 AM] TonyL#3577
So you can write metadata of NFT to description


[23-May-19 07:30 AM] akiii#2220
But for cryptokittie all character are a non fungible token


[23-May-19 07:31 AM] akiii#2220
But they can have the same name no ?


[23-May-19 07:31 AM] akiii#2220
With different power etc


[23-May-19 07:33 AM] TonyL#3577
You can just write needed information to token description:
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=HELLOWORLD tokencreate KITTYTOKEN 0.00000001 "{
"type": "Catassin"
"name": "Meow Killa",
"srength": 21,
"superpower": "fluffy"
}
"```


[23-May-19 07:34 AM] TonyL#3577
And you can create as many KITTYTOKEN NFT as your dapp need


[23-May-19 07:35 AM] akiii#2220
Oh okay


[23-May-19 07:36 AM] akiii#2220
And how can you extract this description ?


[23-May-19 07:37 AM] TonyL#3577
`tokencreate` call will generate transaction hex as output. After you broadcast it by `sendrawtransaction hex` you'll get transaction id (we can call it token id)


[23-May-19 07:37 AM] TonyL#3577
And then you'll able to check information as:
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=HELLOWORLD tokeninfo tokenid`


[23-May-19 07:38 AM] TonyL#3577
And you'll see something like a:
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=HELLOWORLD tokeninfo 43850dfce744581ef44775086625745adecd628993c5ff4c1c786cfd21009add

{
  "result": "success",

Hi, I'm trying `tokenorders`.
According to docs```If no tokenid is provided, it displays the on-chain orderbook for all available tokens.```(`https://docs.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-api/assets.html#tokenorders`)
But I'm getting```

Hi, is it possible to create more than one kind of token from a single coin?  For example, if I create a CF chain, Could I make a CF1 andCF2 token?  Or would I need to make a CF1 chain and CF2 chain and tokenize both?


[20-Sep-19 11:55 PM] CrisF#3405
One more,  is it possible to increase the supply of tokens after initial creation?  For example, if I had an initial 1,000,000 token supply, could I add an additional 10,000 tokens later?


[21-Sep-19 12:36 AM] dimxy#2587
Hi,
tokens are differentiated by their tokenid. Tokenid is unique for each created token . You may create many tokens with different tokenids.
It is not currently possible to increase token amount for the same tokenid after the creation


[21-Sep-19 12:52 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @dimxy ,
Thanks.
I wanted to create a token that could have tokens added as people bought them.


[21-Sep-19 12:54 AM] CrisF#3405
Can you think of anyway this would be possible using current Modules, cross-chain etc?


[22-Sep-19 01:41 AM] dimxy#2587
I think for this we need to modify the current Token module.
I guess the token validation needs to be extended very much to prevent unauthorized token injection.
The token rpc also would be changed as there may be both tokens that allow to increase the supply and those that do not. Also for NFTs I guess we should not allow this.


[22-Sep-19 02:03 AM] jl777c#5810
self-import could work for that


[22-Sep-19 04:23 AM] phm87#7395
Can we issue a new token type on a running chain ? I think about sth similar to erc20


[22-Sep-19 04:24 AM] gcharang#6833
if it has the tokens module enabled, yes
just use tokencreate

But with self-import you can generate coins as you like, so it is a question of trust to that coin as you can generate them by your will.


[23-Sep-19 03:20 AM] Mihailo#5902
But still, if you want to generate new coins/tokens when people buys them then you have a single point of issue so still people need to trust that point.


[23-Sep-19 03:23 AM] CrisF#3405
I'm actually asking for someone else.  They have asked if we are able to increase token supply, if a fund were added to for example.
It seems key to their idea.


[23-Sep-19 03:24 AM] Mihailo#5902
@CrisF, you also have a solution to create maxtokens available and transfer them to point of sale, then when people buy them it will just be transfered to them.

[23-Sep-19 03:28 AM] gcharang#6833
another solution:
As the owner seems to have infinite printing power and is trusted,
just name the first batch as TokenB1, once they are sold out and new ones are needed, create another batch and call them TokenB2
and declare that TokenB1 and TokenB2 represent the same asset
GUI can treat the two kinds as the same and end user won't know the difference

What is `self-import`?


[23-Sep-19 03:29 AM] gcharang#6833
<https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/smart-chains/smart-chain-api/crosschain.html#selfimport>
allows creation of any number of new coins on a smart chain by a trusted pubkey

{Reactions}
🙏 

[23-Sep-19 03:31 AM] CrisF#3405
Oh, I've been using that document today for the crosschain migration!  I didn't look down that far 🤦


[23-Sep-19 03:39 AM] CrisF#3405
The self-import seems very useful.  
And a pubkey from a multi-sig address could be used, couldn't it?


[23-Sep-19 03:57 AM] gcharang#6833
@CrisF I don't think the current implementation supports multisig control for self import
but it can be added

@dimxy can you confirm?


[23-Sep-19 04:18 AM] dimxy#2587
I believe any pubkey could be used in self-import as the pubkey that creates coins
and self-import does not support tokens, only coins

I am not sure multisig addresses have pubkeys like the regular ones, atleast the pubkey isn't available through a rpc


[23-Sep-19 04:25 AM] CrisF#3405
Ahh...


[23-Sep-19 04:25 AM] jl777c#5810
multisig has multiple pubkeys, that is why it is multisig


[23-Sep-19 04:27 AM] gcharang#6833
may be the redeemscript can be used in place of pubkey to launch a chain and control the coins?


[23-Sep-19 04:29 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, that would be a way

Hello everybody, I am creating Crypto Art and selling it through Makersplace.com they are using Ethereum as a way of Non-Fungible Art registration, of course I would like to sell them in the Komodo Ecosystem instead, so is there any project going on now that I can look into?

Hi @Nacho Figx 👋
I'm testing out Tokens now, but not sure of any projects that have been working on this yet that are beyond the stages that you are at.  Hopefully someone else will know of something.


[24-Sep-19 04:38 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi, I'm getting below error, although pubkey is imported```./komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKMYLO tokenaddress
error code: -1
error message:
to use CC contracts, you need to launch daemon with valid -pubkey= for an address in your wallet```


[24-Sep-19 04:40 AM] CrisF#3405
I would like to check whether a NFT migration from `CFEKMYLO6` has arrived.


[24-Sep-19 04:41 AM] CrisF#3405
Any ideas on why I'd be getting the above error?


[24-Sep-19 04:42 AM] CrisF#3405
I did a regular (non-token) migration on the same chains yesterday and the daemon hasn't been shut down since.


[24-Sep-19 04:45 AM] gcharang#6833
@CrisF try providing the pubkey as an argument


[24-Sep-19 04:50 AM] CrisF#3405
I tried that with the same result.


[24-Sep-19 04:51 AM] CrisF#3405
Also restarted `MYLO`, but didn't help.


[24-Sep-19 11:13 AM] Mihailo#5902
@CrisF you need to start Komodo daemon with -pubkey=<your_pub_key> parameter.


[24-Sep-19 01:22 PM] CrisF#3405
Hi @Mihailo, the chains were all started with -pubkey=<MYPUBKEY>.  That's why I'm not sure what is going wrong.


[24-Sep-19 01:35 PM] Mihailo#5902
And that pubkey must have pribate key in your wallet if you want to create cc txs


[24-Sep-19 02:02 PM] CrisF#3405
Yes, I have the same priv key imported in both chains.


[24-Sep-19 02:04 PM] CrisF#3405
Will the same pubkey create the same CC addresses?


[24-Sep-19 02:05 PM] CrisF#3405
I noticed this error on receiving chain after migrating a NFT to it.


[25-Sep-19 03:26 AM] CrisF#3405
Could this error be refering to a 'CCaddress', rather than a regular 'R' address? ```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=CFEKMYLO tokenaddress
error code: -1
error message:
to use CC contracts, you need to launch daemon with valid -pubkey= for an address in your wallet```


[25-Sep-19 03:28 AM] CrisF#3405
I am running both migration chain and KMD with the same pubkey and have the same 'R' address imported into both migration chain.


[25-Sep-19 03:31 AM] CrisF#3405
When I tried the NFT token migration I used one of the CC addresses. Afk atm and forget name of address I used.
It was the address that had token balance in the sending chain.


[25-Sep-19 03:32 AM] CrisF#3405
I couldn't find a way to import a CCaddress, but read they were created by the pubkey running the chain.


[25-Sep-19 04:55 AM] Mihailo#5902
@CrisF  Can you do any CC tx now?


[25-Sep-19 08:42 AM] CrisF#3405
Not on the receiving chain (`CFEKMYLO`), @Mihailo.  Tried on tokens and some on faucet with same result.  This is after a CFEKMYLO restart.  
CC is working on the sending chain, `CFEKMYLO6`.

Hi @Mihailo, @smkhound has solved it 💎 Tokens not enabled of `MYLO` ```smk762 - herpetographerToday at 8:46 AM
same result here. MYLO6 returns 3 txids, MYLO returns pubkey error - confirmed it is set in htop. Also tested oracleslist which returns empty (not error).
assetchains.json has 
    "ac_ccenable": "226,236", 
for CFEKMYLO. Safe to assume that tokens module is not activated on that chain. ```

@CrisF Figured out what is wrong


[26-Sep-19 02:08 AM] Mihailo#5902
First, evalcode 226 is IMPORTCOIN and not TOKENS. Second, the [cc]address rpcs are checking for evalcode 0 is it enabled so it fails on it and retunrs that message.


[26-Sep-19 02:09 AM] Mihailo#5902
So you should start the cahin with -ac_ccenable=227,236 for tokens and oracles. And I need to change the [cc]address rpcs to work correctly

[26-Sep-19 02:22 AM] Mihailo#5902
@jl777c Should [cc]address rpc work even if some CC is not enabled?


[26-Sep-19 02:23 AM] Mihailo#5902
I thnik there is no need. If you didn't enable some CC on your chain, there is no need for you to know addresses of that CC


[26-Sep-19 05:41 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure it matters either way


[27-Sep-19 12:31 AM] Mihailo#5902
@CrisF BTW, the fix for address rpcs is merged into FSM


[27-Sep-19 12:56 AM] CrisF#3405
Great, thanks for the help with this @Mihailo! 
When I've completed a NFT migration I'll  set up a FSM test chain to see that and test out `self-import`.
I might be asking you more questions ;)

Hey all, I think I found a bug (or I'm doing this wrong)
I'm getting errors when I run `tokenorders` without a tokenID.

<https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-api/assets.html#tokenorders> 
These docs say tokenID is optional, without tokenID is supposed to display all available orders, but I'm getting the error ```error code: -1
error message:
no tokenid```

Next step for me is to add an image to the token.  I have the method, but haven't had the time.
I had a question about the ability to, in Komodo, to do this.  
Not quite sure if it is exactly what was desired as we didn't have much time to discuss the problem.
@barv, @bartwr , this question came from KB.  I'm not quite sure if this is exactly what he was after but maybe you could confirm?  It might be one part of what he would like.

[21-Oct-19 01:09 AM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
yesterday I started to play around with tokens, but on MORTY instead.
was also thinking about adding images, I see 2 ways:
-either adding the images url directly to the tokens description
-or use an existing back-end API, extract images out of it based on the tokens ID.
btw tokens that I created on MORTY are Pokémon, & I'll use a Pokémon api to attach images to them

{Reactions}
💥 (2) 

[21-Oct-19 02:18 AM] gcharang#6833
if you go with adding images via url, make sure to include a sha256 hash
it should help detect tampering  

I didn't quite get the second option?


[21-Oct-19 03:28 AM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
for example this is the PIKACHU token that I created yesterday on MORTY:
```
komodo-cli -ac_name=MORTY tokeninfo "fc658af6364f80f76f7ef92e18303ebae91b8d076757c624c7653710a7887b29"
{
  "result": "success",
  "tokenid": "fc658af6364f80f76f7ef92e18303ebae91b8d076757c624c7653710a7887b29",
  "owner": "03f6bd15dba7e986f0c976ea19d8a9093cb7c989d499f1708a0386c5c5659e6c4e",
  "name": "PIKACHU",
  "supply": 6,
  "description": "{\"id\":\"25\",\"name\":Pikachu}"
}
```
for this example only id & name are stored on chain, from the id/name on chain, which can can get via `curl`, I can fetch it into an API like 
```
https://pokeapi.glitch.me/v1/pokemon/Pikachu
```
& retrieve additional data out of it, including images.
ofc you have to decide which one to store on chain, which one to store off chain.


[21-Oct-19 03:36 AM] gcharang#6833
now I understand the second option
anyway, including the hash in the description is a good idea

Hi @PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator, With the second option, how would you wiew the image?


[21-Oct-19 03:41 AM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
yeah including the hash makes sense


[21-Oct-19 03:41 AM] gcharang#6833
the gui dev should know which base url the token is using for images


[21-Oct-19 03:44 AM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
@CrisF once you have the API (either setting 1 up yourself or in this case I use an existing API), you can make a simple API fetch with the pokémon name as parameter, then retrieve the image url return by the API, display it on the website. I think I'll be dev-ing a demo real soon


[21-Oct-19 03:44 AM] CrisF#3405
Would the GUI just read the data from the API and diplay the imageg from `"https://pokeres.bastionbot.org/images/pokemon/25.png"` (found in the API data)?


[21-Oct-19 03:44 AM] CrisF#3405

@PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator if you are looking to minimise space taken on the blockchain, you can also store the data as
```
'["25","Pikachu","6b86b273ff34fce19d6b804eff5a3f5747ada4eaa22f1d49c01e52ddb7875b4b"]'
```
no need to mention the keys: id, name, hash


[21-Oct-19 03:47 AM] CrisF#3405
`including the hash in the description`
Is this the hash of the image?


[21-Oct-19 03:48 AM] gcharang#6833
> Is theis the hash of the image?
yes
if the image at the url is changed, it can be detected

`no need to mention the keys: id, name, hash` agreed


[21-Oct-19 03:50 AM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
the API call I post above is just 1 example with Pikachu as parameter, the full documentation of that API can be found here:
<https://pokedevs.gitbook.io/pokedex/resources/pokemon#example-request>
you can replace Pikachu by something else & give it a try


[21-Oct-19 03:51 AM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
and these are just data returned by the API, how to represent those data is up to the front-end dev


[21-Oct-19 03:56 AM] CrisF#3405
What would be the main advantages / disadvantages between method 1 and 2?


[21-Oct-19 03:59 AM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
method 1: in general if you store a value on chain, it's non modifiable, . method 2: the value is stored off chain, so it's modifiable, but if you store too many things on chain, the chain can be bloated. So you need to consider between storing on chain or off chain.

Is this data (https://pokeapi.glitch.me/v1/pokemon/Pikachu) part of the API, or is it just data that the API connects the token to?


[21-Oct-19 04:27 AM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
that is part of the API.

{Reactions}
🙏 

[21-Oct-19 04:43 AM] CrisF#3405
Thanks, I wasn't sure if the data itself, or server were part of the API. (Or if the API is only the link).


[21-Oct-19 05:10 AM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
in short, the back-end server has some code running on it (imagine it's like komodo daemon), API are the set of instructions that allow you to interact with the back-end (like how you run `komodo-cli help` or `komodo-cli getbalance` to interact with komodo daemon, but in this case you interact with the back-end via `https://pokeapi.glitch.me/v1/pokemon/Pikachu` or `https://pokeapi.glitch.me/v1/pokemon/25` instead)

[23-Oct-19 12:39 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont understand the question, you can just send the tokens to pubkey 0000000000000000...000000


[23-Oct-19 12:40 AM] jl777c#5810
it is an unspendable pubkey


[23-Oct-19 12:40 AM] jl777c#5810
as all 0s is an illegal secp256 field element

[23-Oct-19 05:54 AM] Regnar#6164
If that becomes something popular, either using that 0 pubkey or even an RPC `tokenburn` (idk if an RPC would be necessary or wanted) but maybe `tokenlist` could then exclude those that have been burned?

@gcharang I just tried your node-komodo-rpc wrapper, works perfectly on NodeJS, doesn't work on browser though (or is it just me ?) , got this kind of error
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54040683/nuxt-module-not-found-error-cant-resolve-fs/54055517>
According to this post `fs` is a NodeJS specific module & can't be used on browser


[24-Oct-19 09:53 AM] gcharang#6833
@PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator I made it to work for nodejs i.e., on a server as a part of a larger application that needs to interact with the komodo daemon

I can modify it to work in a browser though, let me look into it

take your time, I'll be trying something else <https://www.npmjs.com/package/bitcoind-rpc>, this appears to wokrs both on NodeJS & browsers, but I run into another issue, seems like browsers don't really like http requests in general & blocks them <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/Errors> , have to find a solution to get around it 😅

it seems `tokentransfer` doesn't work properly on CFEKMYLO6, after  sending out any amount of tokens, the remaining token balance (return by `tokenbalance`) becomes 0 (after tx's confirmation).
Or it could be `tokenbalance` that doesn't return the correct number

*For KB* 👇``` Attaching Data to Tokens

We can attach meta data to the tokens at their creation.

The maximum size of data that can fit in a single Komodo transaction is 10000 bytes. This is enough to include all sorts of data, and even simple images.

The developer is naturally free to use their imagination in the design of this data. For example, you can describe their purpose and add a json data structure that informs other software of the properties of this token.

Advanced developers can even add functionality to allow the tokens to gain new data over time as they are passed through transactions.```

LABS and komodo are much the same, except some RPC calls. Token transfer never worked that well for me, when i tested it. NFT seemed to work fine though.


[27-Oct-19 12:26 PM] dimxy#2587
This  "error": "some inputs signed not with -pubkey=pk" means that token creator wallet has other privkey(s) in addition to -pubkey=pk.
It is recommended that the tokencreator has only one pk in the wallet.
Actually this check prevents that a token creator creates a token and puts some pubkey in the token opreturn data for which he does not have the privkey (making the token users believe that the token is really created by the one whose pubkey is in the token data)


[27-Oct-19 02:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
why not just filter the inputs so it only uses the correct ones?

Is it possible to filter the inputs as Blackjok3r suggested, or should I make a new wallet with only the token pubkey in it?

Yes thank you and blackjok very much, in fact I have already done this ( just changed to AddNormalInputs2 which filters mypk inputs by design. Just have not pushed yet)

if you click on VERIFY, it will sign&verify a message to prove that you actually own that pubkey, the number will then turn green

Didn't need to verify this time.  Already green and `Verify` button off.


[01-Nov-19 01:32 AM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
yeah, once you verify you won't need to verify until you change your pubkey


[01-Nov-19 01:34 AM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
now if you check tokeninfo of for example `komodo-cli -ac_name=MORTY tokeninfo d8d83d73bed2acd693607076e4e097689c1de9f5c542dfdb177f459a6ee5154a` you will see that the owner is `039fc98c764bc85aed97d690d7942a4fd1190b2fa4f5f4c5c8e0957fac5c6ede00` (it's me)

[01-Nov-19 05:50 AM] Regnar#6164
I'm not super familiar with the tokens structure, but is there some way of knowing the difference between tokens based on origin? Like the creators pubkey? Like what happens if I make my own pokemon token and send it to my pubkey in the app, is there a way (not saying in the app right now, more in general) to test the origin of the token?


[01-Nov-19 05:51 AM] Alright#0419
token is referenced by the txid used to create it, can easily see the pubkey that did it

{Reactions}
👍 (2) 

[01-Nov-19 05:51 AM] Alright#0419
not sure how well that answers the question 🤷


[01-Nov-19 05:53 AM] Regnar#6164
Yea I was thinking if PHBA built an app and wanted to solely handle card issuing, is there a way to check tokens that are sent to a pubkey for the origin to make sure it is "official"


[01-Nov-19 05:55 AM] Regnar#6164
If they can check original pubkey then that works, just a way to make sure someone doesn't create a ton of the strongest cards and send them to a game


[01-Nov-19 07:13 AM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
Alright was right,when using cli-command  like `tokeninfo` or `tokenbalance`, you have to provide the tx that created the token, which acts like the uniqe id of that token <https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-api/tokens.html#tokeninfo>


[01-Nov-19 01:11 PM] Regnar#6164
Yea the `owner` response is what I was thinking. This way there could be multiple pokemon games and by creating a GUI that only displays specific Owner tokens, or only allows those in gameplay, you can prevent a situation where someone makes a bunch of a powerful card and floods the card market. Or you can leave it blank, or build a white list to accept tokens from multiple sources


[01-Nov-19 01:11 PM] Regnar#6164
Cool!


[01-Nov-19 04:14 PM] CrisF#3405
Is there a way that tokens could be shown on an explorer?


[01-Nov-19 04:14 PM] phm87#7395
we can adapt an existing explorer code

{Reactions}
👍 

[01-Nov-19 04:15 PM] phm87#7395
I don't know if we need an explorer with txindex or not ...


[01-Nov-19 04:16 PM] phm87#7395
explorers with txindex are better but the only one that I know is iquidus explorer and its source is really wonky and I had troubles to install it


[01-Nov-19 04:17 PM] phm87#7395
explorer without txindex makes sense if you want to show only the tokens from the token distributor (I imagine a pool to simplify)


[01-Nov-19 04:18 PM] CrisF#3405
Would each token ID require a separate explorer?


[01-Nov-19 04:18 PM] phm87#7395
there is one into yiimp in PHP that I can adapt. I won't give a try on iquidus because it was too painful with it


[01-Nov-19 04:20 PM] phm87#7395
I don't know enough tokens to tell you. What I can do is to set up a token distributor and try with and without your ID. I think that if you can have 10 ID's of tokens on the same nodes, then only one explorer for the 10 ID's is enough


[01-Nov-19 04:21 PM] phm87#7395
can you do tx with different token ID on the same running node ?


[01-Nov-19 04:21 PM] phm87#7395
(maybe we already have what you want with the display of pokemons per address created by PHBA2061)

{Reactions}
👍 

[01-Nov-19 04:22 PM] CrisF#3405
For example in PHBA's app, each character has it's own tokenid, would a meta-explorer showing all tokens (characters) inn an address be possible (`  "PubkeyCCaddress(Tokens)": "RBkmaRaa6LeyTRaiD1tYqQc9bEF6gvwLnu",
`?)


[01-Nov-19 04:23 PM] CrisF#3405
`can you do tx with different token ID on the same running node`
Yes, all the pokemon tokens are running on the same chain (MORTY).


[01-Nov-19 04:28 PM] CrisF#3405
There are many types of address.  Don't know if that makes it easier or harder.


[01-Nov-19 04:28 PM] CrisF#3405

[01-Nov-19 04:31 PM] phm87#7395
I'll have a look at this after finishing to test apow into chips. But I think that PHBA may adapt an explorer before I do anything ^^ (or CHMEX maybe as he likes explorers)


[01-Nov-19 04:35 PM] CrisF#3405

all cc smartchains have -addressindex enabled, this is basically the rpc calls the insight explorer uses. look at the addressindex rpc calls


[02-Nov-19 01:03 AM] jl777c#5810
you can just issue these rpc calls for the pages that display transactions for an address. there is no need for the explorer to have a DB, it is built into the komodod

just reworking some of the Flask frameworks I had, and I already wrote up Python RPC wrappers for Tokens CC


[03-Nov-19 11:10 AM] Regnar#6164
I need the dev branch to run `tokenorders` so I can actually put orders in there


[03-Nov-19 11:12 AM] Regnar#6164
Also I'm unsure of this, but does token swapping actually mean token for token, or can you also do KMD for tokens?


[03-Nov-19 11:14 AM] Regnar#6164
oh I think I got it `The tokenbid method posts a public bid order. To fill the order, the parent chain's coin must be used.`

`git checkout dev` then build. `git log -1` will show branch.


[03-Nov-19 11:36 AM] CrisF#3405
To get tokens back to coins I believe that `Gateways` is needed.  The next logical Module to make a demo GUI for?


[03-Nov-19 11:39 AM] Regnar#6164
Yea I think people are going to want to price in a single unit of account, of which KMD would be ideal


[03-Nov-19 11:39 AM] Regnar#6164
Obviously tokens to tokens is also important, just think KMD deserves to get some love too.


[03-Nov-19 11:40 AM] Regnar#6164
Yea gateways for KMD to KMDT, token DEX to swap KMDT, and withdraw as KMD


[03-Nov-19 11:41 AM] CrisF#3405
Yes, we'll be able to tokenize kmd for the token market.


[03-Nov-19 11:42 AM] CrisF#3405
I thought @TonyL had a TUI/gui for Gateways already.  Couldn't find it, but found his `Channels` GUI here `https://github.com/tonymorony/ChannelsCC-GUI`

Hi @johnwhitestar 👋
We have started to put together some reference GUIs for Antara Modules.  Very early stages.
PHBA2061 has made a Pokemon token ☝ and Regnar has added a lot of info to the resources document that is waiting on the PR to be accepted.
There also now a Trello board for Tokens/Assets here:  https://trello.com/b/tpEsu2j1/module-assets
Please add to it if you can.

I'm just happy that someone feels the need of GUI and actually trying to fill that space with whatever they got.
we can't have enough GUI devs 
the more the better
and CC showcase in GUI is much needed


[05-Nov-19 07:15 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm just busy with current project for probably next 2-3 weeks.
then I'll start my contribution on CC GUIs in Node.js + jQuery based work.


[05-Nov-19 07:16 PM] Regnar#6164
I don't mind GUI in python, which I've gotten pretty used to since I know a bit of it. the HTML stuff is a bit different but is important especially for localhost run browser apps


[05-Nov-19 07:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'll suggest you to start taking bits and peaces from bootstrap website and make the HTML layout

I figured since most are just proof of concepts, and not really full functioning GUIs, it was better to just show them in the proof of concept list


[05-Nov-19 07:18 PM] Regnar#6164
especially if it's showing CC capabilities


[05-Nov-19 07:19 PM] Regnar#6164
like the pokedex, which is awesome


[05-Nov-19 07:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
at this moment, PoC GUIs are much needed and important.

I'm going to PM you something, a bit long and out of place for here


[05-Nov-19 07:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
whatever GUIs we can get is better than having nothing


[05-Nov-19 07:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I rember the CLI days of SuperNET and end users complaining of no GUIs so no development/prodctive work by James 🤦


[05-Nov-19 07:26 PM] Regnar#6164
I mean, a lot of people do see GUI work as "tangible" or something.


[05-Nov-19 07:26 PM] Regnar#6164
because they can SEE it and they imagine users and businesses using it to click buttons and boom blockchain stuff happens


[05-Nov-19 07:42 PM] CrisF#3405
That would be great if you could help out with GUI whenever you have the chance @grewalsatinder !

I have a TokensCC github bot I will put up on Github and on AwesomeKMD when it's done. Got quite a few bugs to work out though


[06-Nov-19 10:41 PM] TonyL#3577
Revamping CC tests to add into CI process, found a little inconsistency for asks/bids cancellation (latest FSM). 
The case is:
Creating bid and ask from node A. Then cancelling it from node B (which don't have "permission" to cancel it obv).
In case with tokenbidcancel generating transaction which rejecting on the broadcast, in case of tokenaskcancel I'm getting error right on tx generation stage. Example can be found below:
https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/XQ6FD7VqMn/
@dimxy can we generate error on tx generation stage in both cases?


[06-Nov-19 11:16 PM] dimxy#2587
@TonyL Are you suggesting that in your test case tokencancelbid should generate an error (before the tx is sent), like tokencancelask?


[06-Nov-19 11:17 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes if there are no difficulties with such implementation @dimxy


[07-Nov-19 12:18 AM] dimxy#2587
In cc assets most of the errors are discovered on the validation stage while the rpc creation code itself is rather simple. So usually a transaction could be created but if it has an issue it will be found later, while the tx is validated


[14-Nov-19 04:34 AM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
I'm testing token methods & notice that orders created by `tokenbid` method aren't shown in the array returned by `mytokenorders`, only orders created by `tokenask` are shown


[14-Nov-19 03:19 PM] CrisF#3405
Hmm, maybe @dimxy knows why ☝
🤞


[14-Nov-19 10:17 PM] dimxy#2587
Yes only asks are included into mytokenorders rpc.
(Maybe this is because we created this rpc as an ad-hoc method for some specific purpose. Let's add bids too)

[15-Nov-19 12:32 AM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
adding a new method  to check the amount of unconfirmed tokens balance (similar to `tokenbalance` ) shouldn't be too complicated right ?


[15-Nov-19 12:51 AM] jl777c#5810
you mean scanning the mempool?


[15-Nov-19 01:07 AM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
I mean a method similar to `getunconfirmedbalance` , but for getting unconfirmed token balance, I don't know in details how `getunconfirmedbalance` is implemented though


[15-Nov-19 01:12 AM] jl777c#5810
it is possible, but very tricky as the addressindex is not updated with mempool

{Reactions}
👍 

[15-Nov-19 01:12 AM] jl777c#5810
best would be to scan mempool for affected tokens and mark it as pending, but it will be much easier to wait until the confirmation and addressindex updates

I just pushed some updates to my app:
- get rid of the CORS problem, so you can run the app normally on the browser.
- adding some functionalities like token transferring, ask/bid orders placing/filling (based on the existing RPC methods) which allow users to trade their tokens.
- I placed some orders selling my Pokémon at 1 MORTY per token, anyone is welcome to buy it ... 😂
- I didn't really focus on UX, so the app might be a bit messy.

@PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator Where is the css file?


[17-Nov-19 12:15 PM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
I didn't make any css file, I built my app using these frameworks NuxtJS + Vuetify , the styling was done using Vuetify , everything was built into js files that you can find in `.nuxt\dist\client`

Hi, is a NFT just a UTXO?


[02-Dec-19 03:04 PM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
yes, everything is utxo based, the difference between NFT utxo & a "normal" utxo is the scriptSig/scriptPubKey.
try using `decoderawtransaction` on the hex value returned by `tokentransfer` / `sendtoaddress` for example, you'll see the difference.

@CrisF antara modules use a new “vout”, UTXO with different signing method.  Just like p2pk & p2sh differ, antara offers a new signing method to greatly expand the btc protocol.

@PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator 
I had a go of Opensea on eth to create a storefront, like your Pokémon trading aspect.  If you have metamask or opera mobile with crypto wallet support, have a look.

I’d be interested in whether you wanted to make an Opensea for all KMD ecosystem chains of the future?

Opensea has libs to look over how they do things.  They got funding from coinbase & binance labs.

Here’s a blog post of my experience with it: https://hybriddex.com/2019/12/create-storefront-opensea-howto/

@Mylo Thank Mylo, I'll take a look at that
I created Komodo-Pokémon just as a proof of concept, I still don't know if I really want to go on & make real products with it


[13-Dec-19 05:52 PM] Mylo#8306
I understand that feeling. Take a look around Opensea, it’s basically a hosted version and platform of what you have created.

@polycryptoblog cool man.  I have some py cloud stuff to do atm, same sorta at scale stuff, so mixing in rpc from kmd chains can be done imo.  I’m new to py so will be busy getting the hang of it.
The volume of Opensea and some of the games is astonishing.  I’m not that kind of player 🙂 quake is like coffee when I’m back home

noob question, can cc-assets be run directly from Komodo?  or do they need to be run from an asset chain?   just wondering essentially  if smart contracts work directly on the Komodo chain?


[04-May-20 11:05 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Needs to be run on an assetchain,   In the future we will enable some CCs on the main chain.


[04-May-20 11:05 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Not sure if assets will be one of them, seems better to put that on a sidechain

You guys are much faster than ETH right?


[31-May-20 05:06 PM] Regnar#6164
Non fungibles can be done with Komodo Assets. It just depends how many tokens you decide to make, NFTs would obviously be single tokens, while Fungible would be more


[31-May-20 05:06 PM] raevinn#1919
I'm trying to think if it makes sense to go full dapp


[31-May-20 05:06 PM] raevinn#1919
or like, hybrid


[31-May-20 05:07 PM] Regnar#6164
well you should really read up on the differences and the types of functionality you'll need. Ethereum and Komodo are two different beasts. We have a lot of things that can do what Ethereum can do, but generally we have a different infrastructure type. For example Komodo believes in multichain solutions.


[31-May-20 05:08 PM] raevinn#1919
I see


[31-May-20 05:08 PM] raevinn#1919
I also believe in that 🙂


[31-May-20 05:08 PM] raevinn#1919
so I can do ETH + Komodo efts


[31-May-20 05:08 PM] raevinn#1919
NFTs


[31-May-20 05:08 PM] raevinn#1919
lol


[31-May-20 05:09 PM] Regnar#6164
so while all ERC20 and ERC721 tokens are on Ethereum and pay gas in ETH, Komodo believes in building your own chains and paying fees only in your own coin. We have dPoW to protect smaller chains from 51% attacks and have a ton of tools to build with. This also means you don't have to sync Ethereum's entire blockchain just to run your app.


[31-May-20 05:09 PM] raevinn#1919
Anyways, I've gotta head to bed


[31-May-20 05:09 PM] raevinn#1919
Thanks so much for this


[31-May-20 05:09 PM] Regnar#6164
alright. I would recommend reading through the docs and asking around here to make sure it's a good fit for what you want to do


[31-May-20 05:09 PM] raevinn#1919
will contact red fox labs


[31-May-20 05:09 PM] raevinn#1919
Will do

[01-Jun-20 08:23 AM] Regnar#6164
I think one of the biggest things to deal with is ETH gas prices. If your project relies on transactions of a token, it doesn't make sense to spend more on gas than the value of the tokens being moved. ETH will still have tokens that have some purpose, for example those that only really matter on who is holding it (not rely on usage or transactions) because the gas price doesn't matter for that.


[26-Jun-20 06:48 PM] GISELX#8347
@Regnar  Pokémon starter pack?! I would love to hold some! I’m an artists trying to make my way through tokenizing on different chains. Do any of you know a minting platform that would make it easy for a non-coder to accomplish? I have now minted Art NFTs on ETH, EOS, Enjin, WAX & even and NFTs holding DGX.

is it possible to make a bid/ask exclusively for just two parties?


[11-Oct-21 04:49 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
If you wanted to sell to somebody specifically, you would have them bid on your token and specifically fill that bid.

{Reactions}
👍 

[11-Oct-21 02:57 PM] cryptosammy#3587
@NutellaLicka that makes perfect sense, however, would that bid not be placed in the DEX public order book?


[11-Oct-21 03:15 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yes, but only the token owner can accept that bid. This is a problem if the token isn't an NFT I suppose. There is no way for private DEX transactions using assets, or bid/asks that are only fillable by a certain publeys.


[11-Oct-21 03:24 PM] cryptosammy#3587
@NutellaLicka can you elaborate on how the token owner only can accept the bid? I thought that there must first be an ask request?


[11-Oct-21 03:38 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Have a read of these docs. They explain how a trade can be initiated by the buyer (bid) or initiated by a seller (ask).

I cant list all the changes off the top of my head sorry. Youll have to compare documentation

There are many small changes


[11-Oct-21 03:42 PM] cryptosammy#3587
@NutellaLicka the top 3 with most impact?


[11-Oct-21 07:32 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
The majority of the changes are in the tokens module, but the assets module was adjusted to take into consideration the royalty %. That is the biggest change

❤️ 

[11-Oct-21 11:09 PM] cryptosammy#3587
@NutellaLicka i get it now, Assets CC is the DEX module and Tokens CC is for the actual token. I am so stupid. All the API from Tokel though looks similar (not that its a problem)
