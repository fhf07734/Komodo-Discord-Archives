Hello Wachsman team!


[20-Feb-19 12:55 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Just read through this recently published article 

https://www.cryptoglobe.com/latest/2019/02/Komodo-atomic-swap-trading-app/

and noticed a few small typos

Komodo to Soon Release Atomic Swap-Enabled Trading App, CTO Reveal...
Cryptocurrency exchanges have been under fir so far this year, as hackers have repeatedly targeted¬†them and other events hurt the confidence users have in certain platforms. Atomic swap technology is set to revolutionize the way we trade cryptocurrencies and more.

[20-Feb-19 01:01 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Just a few minor things. Just let me know the best way  to get them cleared up


[20-Feb-19 01:04 AM] Daniel CP#2020
e.g. under the question about LN, the writer quotes ca as saying 

"We've developed something we call a trust API - while we're always trying building the system trustless we know normal users don't like to wait for confirmations"

That sentence needs some work. Maybe something like "We've developed something we call a trust API. While we're always trying to build trustless systems, we know normal users don't like to wait for confirmations"

Just one example, there are a few places that could use some light editing


[21-Feb-19 11:05 AM] Audo#5667

Hi all


[21-Feb-19 12:11 PM] AdamB#0212
thanks for the add!


[19-Mar-19 12:26 PM] AdamB#0212
Hi Team


[19-Mar-19 12:26 PM] AdamB#0212
Is there any update regarding the Mobile DEX invitation that was sent to influencers? We'd like to have all information on hand as we begin to shop around the exclusive for the Atomic Swap timeline.


[19-Mar-19 01:20 PM] Audo#5667
@ca333 should be aware of that, or do you know about the details @n2okpride ? I can't remember the exact dates/times


[19-Mar-19 01:32 PM] ca333#0333
@AdamB we are starting the internal tests early next week - closed external alpha a week to 2 afterwards. The feedback from those tests float into first revision - after this stage the internal QA gets the ball and our mobile devs polish the app for the beta release this summer. That beta-stage is expected to last for ~6 months likely followed by  a last revision before RC (release candidate) announcement and stable release.


[19-Mar-19 01:47 PM] AdamB#0212
Great, thanks for giving us a rough timeline. If someone could send us the language that was sent to the influencers, that would greatly help our ability to invite reporters. Additionally, what else would we need on hand (technology requirement wise) in order to offer reporters the opportunity to participate in the closed external alpha? For example, is there an invite page, where they'd need to sign up, something specific they'd need to download etc.?


[19-Mar-19 02:40 PM] ca333#0333
We need their google playstore attached email address in order to invite them - they also need an android smartphone.


[28-Mar-19 12:15 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Hello, @AdamB   , are you guys familiar with HARO


[28-Mar-19 12:34 PM] Tamani#2243
Hi @polycryptoblog - Yes, our team references HARO on a daily basis! Was there one in particular that caught your attention recently?


[28-Mar-19 12:41 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Tamani   we are wondering about using it in reverse to get out some recent developments regarding oracles when marketing has digested it.  There is also one requester who frequently appears that seems like it would be good for us to get on ,  Disruptor Daily.


[28-Mar-19 12:59 PM] Tamani#2243
@polycryptoblog Ok! I do think that a lot of individual companies use it as a resource now, more so than regular reporters, so I don't think that's a bad idea. Disruptor Daily puts out a lot of HAROs and our experience with them has only been moderate. We've secured interview with them for clients in the past, only for them to completely ghost on the interview or never publish. We've refrained with working with them for the time being until they get the site up and running more frequently

Hi Team, just circling back here to see if anyone has had a chance to review the CryptoSlate opportunity on Komodo and video games we sent through last week. Per Caitlin's most recent email, we've managed to get the deadline pushed back until EOD today. Please let us know if you have any further questions.


[10-May-19 01:54 PM] AdamB#0212
Hi Team, just circling back to see if you have any updates for me via the emails I sent through this morning:


[10-May-19 01:54 PM] AdamB#0212
1) Any update regarding the situation with a possible fake IBM research account


[10-May-19 01:55 PM] AdamB#0212
2) I saw that a member of your biz dev team (James Brown) will be attending an after party on May 14th. Will James be at Consensus/would he be willing to interview on behalf of Komodo in case we see any inbound interest?

[10-May-19 02:08 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
If something comes up we can skype in or hop on a zoom call or meetup with someone

Hi Jason, the Finder team's TV crew is in town, and I want to submit you for a video interview.

@AdamB fakey on the ibm.  We made contact with a cryptographer at ibm who did the dilithium quantum resistant stuff, which is the code James used for the kmd dilithium stuff...
He made enquires internally and was friendly and seemingly had some interest in blockchain with what we‚Äôd done (and was aware of the kmd work)

Hi @AdamB ,
Please find attached the current version of the AtomicDEX site. It will live under atomicdex.io

Who is Matthew Keeley? He kindly edited some of my work earlier today -- the Atomic Swap History article I wrote for internal/researcher purposes -- and I wanted to thank him.


[01-Jul-19 03:52 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Ahh, I hear that he works at Wachsman.


[01-Jul-19 03:52 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I think I adopted 99% of all his suggestions regardless, but if there are any that I didn't adopt, tell him he is free to change it however he wants for whatever Wachsman would like to do with the document.

Hey @AdamB , here's the BIO

```
Steve is Komodo‚Äôs Chief Strategy Officer. He is responsible for setting the overall marketing strategy and direction, while ensuring execution across the team. With over a decade of experience working for Fortune 500 tech companies in the enterprise space, Steve has held a wide range of roles including executive marketing strategy, corporate communications management, product marketing, global sales enablement, and account management. Steve left Hewlett-Packard Enterprise to join the Komodo team full-time in (INSERT MONTH AND YEAR). He made the move because he believes in decentralization and wanted to be a part of something that can foster positive changes in the world.
```

@n2okpride can you confirm the year/month you joined our team? That needs to be added to the text.

Hey @AdamB & others, do you have any contacts to Russian crypto news sites? If we translate our website to russian we might want to do some outreach. Here's a general comment from our team member Decker
_ _
> my humble opinion, if we want to focus more on the russian community we need to publish some articles about Komodo and our tech on most popular russian crypto-related resources, like https://bitnovosti.com/ , https://coinspot.io/ and others (if somebody needs, i can prepare a short-list). they have regular audience of crypto-entusiasts, miners and just a people who interested in crypto. but for last 2-3 years i saw no articles / reviews / quick notes about our tech on these resources. the impression is nobody interesting to spread a word about Komodo in russian crypto-related media and people here can't adequately assess komodo tech and it's value in crypto world, bcz they have zero-knowledge about it.
