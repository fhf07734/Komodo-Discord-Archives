@namhoang28 i sent you an invite for https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/dicoapp-e/ which will be the new official repo. please accept the pull request on your repo to keep both synced. I locally fixed the path err in the komodoplatform repo fork already. 
Also shared the workpackage for the second part of the dICO-app porting challenge with you via DM. thank you for your effort so far!

@SHossain can you please test https://github.com/particle4dev/dicoapp-e/releases/tag/v0.8.0 if you have some spare time - use a sandbox or virgin machine - binaries arent sec-checked

hey @SHossain, I just fixed small bug in build version. Please use this version to test.
https://github.com/particle4dev/dicoapp-e/releases/tag/v0.8.1
But I still highly recommend if you can run it from source.
‚Ä®My OS environment: 
‚Ä®```‚Ä®Node: v9.11.2‚Ä®
Npm: 6.3.0‚Ä®```
‚Ä®Also just recorded a video demo if you don‚Äôt have time to run and curious what it looks like.
‚Ä®Thanks!

@siu buying from your bob


[19-Sep-18 11:13 AM] SHossain#0007
first time with only 1 utxo, i selected the pair and put buy order. marketmaker auto splitted the utxo and made 3 new small sized utxo ready for trading. but, the trade status was stuck 0/6 for a long time and no option to start another trade. only way was to restarting the app completely.
after restart, the first swap started and stuck at 4/6.


[19-Sep-18 11:17 AM] SHossain#0007
i guess, if we provide the ability to issue 2 or more swap simultaneously, end user don't have to start the app twice to perform their first swap. or provide manual split functionality.

Sorry guys, it was midnight in my timezone.‚Ä®
```what i notice with the websocket is that it jumps to alice payment when the server is still confirming bob deposit``` @siu @ca333 Don‚Äôt know exactly what happened because I only get swap data from socket stream and update to redux store the changes. Don‚Äôt do any magic thing. It can be 1 to 10 seconds faster than server since it‚Äôs realtime. I will test it again today after I solve a bug related marketmaker in linux.

@SHossain Agreed. Original idea is dICOapp and now it changed alot lol. Noted!


[20-Sep-18 12:27 AM] ca333#0333
thanks for the info @namhoang28 - i tested the app on OSX through the night and i finished a full code review with 88. 
now we are ready to modify the buy-view. Do you want me to modify it in my meteor prototype or is it enough if i sketch it on paper and send you that?


[20-Sep-18 12:29 AM] ca333#0333
we are basically going to modify the "buy" view and turn it into a two area dropdown where each dropdown will let you chose the token you want to swap. For example dropdown in the left side is set to KMD and on the right side its set to BTC - means i want to swap KMD for BTC (= "buy BTC with KMD") - the logic of the actual swap wont change since we just replace the dICO-token on the left side with various other tokens. 
I ll send you a DM with more precise information on this task.

this is just mockup of how the former buy view will look like. the green area is a input box, the grey "swap" in the middle is the button to issue the swap


[20-Sep-18 04:31 AM] ca333#0333
and below we just have the swap history with a realtime swap status update (if you click on "i" it shall show a modal with further swap details)

i like the structure of this mockup

and the grey buttons with the arrows pointing downwards are the dropdown


[20-Sep-18 04:31 AM] ca333#0333
once a user clicks there it should show all available tokens

I think we need to clear a basic question first befor modifying the app into atomicDEX - how do we want to pull this? we have multiple options:
a) separating the dICO app (for sake of 3rd party dICO operators and ecosys service providers) as a whitelabeled solution
b) with a) also having atomicDEX being a separate standalone application (shapeshift like trading wallet)
c) or integerating a atomicDEX view into Agama

[20-Sep-18 12:08 PM] siu#3920
imo we should first get it stable as a stand alone then work to integrate it into agama


[20-Sep-18 12:12 PM] siu#3920
btw i can report i finally got swaps finished using the websocket method.

[20-Sep-18 12:12 PM] siu#3920
the version online does have a broken mm for linux though


[21-Sep-18 02:35 AM] ca333#0333
update - i discussed this with @namhoang28 and we will first finalize the standalone dICO app which goes online as a whitelabel version (since we re literally already there). Afterwards we focus on porting atomicDEX prototype to the same native app-layer or into an Agama view. The "buy/swap" logic will stay the same either way.

little update - we are going through a list of issues/bugs and resolving them together. you can check the github issue page for more details and progress. Most communication ref. dev is happening via DM between me @namhoang28 and @siu who is actively testing from dICO operator and user perspective and helping me and @namhoang28 with valuable feedback. So its little bit quite in here. if anyone has questions feel free to ask or check our github. The app is almost done - i expect it to be passed to QA team for final test and whitelabel release within the coming 2 weeks.

morning @siu


[24-Sep-18 02:10 AM] ca333#0333
seems issue resolved  üôÇ - problem was that the current app did reissue the buy without waiting for the split to confirm.


[24-Sep-18 02:11 AM] ca333#0333
so now we will check against "if utxo.num < 2" - that would mean its not there yet and app not ready to do the swap


[24-Sep-18 02:15 AM] ca333#0333
most "clean and elegant" solution would be still this: User defines amount of buy - now since we know the price, we also know how much the user will be spending for this order - now we issue a manual split TX (sendmany to ourself) that is specifically trimmed to match the user-request. in this case we wont ever use the "auto-split" feature of marketmaker but instead do always a manual split-tx that is based on the user-balance and buy-request. @namhoang28


[24-Sep-18 02:15 AM] ca333#0333
this would require slightly modification of the buy func()


[24-Sep-18 02:16 AM] ca333#0333
so since the current solution you are working on (wait until the utxos are >=2) and give alertbox/modal with user-info to buy diff. amount if utxos is not satisfying marketmaker


[24-Sep-18 02:16 AM] ca333#0333
should be good from user-experience


[24-Sep-18 02:16 AM] ca333#0333
def. better than splitting utxos twice and having user wait x longer

`manual split TX by send to ourself` => I really like this idea, will try it after I finished current solution


[24-Sep-18 03:58 AM] namhoang28#4328
@siu could you help me to test the latest code on this branch?
https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/dicoapp-e/tree/split-the-funds-when-utxos-is-less-than-2

@ca333 I do really like your solution. But what about the fee? do user has to spend double fee (one for manual split and one for a swap)? Is this ok for user?

testing the autosplit now


[24-Sep-18 06:05 AM] siu#3920
swap seems to be going through


[24-Sep-18 10:07 AM] ca333#0333
fee is not a real issue @namhoang28 - we need the initial split to have more than 1 utxo anyway

@everyone - the dICO app clone is finished https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/dicoapp-e/. big thanks goes to @namhoang28 who ported the application mainly his own without getting back to me or other devs. Means he read and understood what the code is doing and replicated it autonomous/independently (decetralized). Plz everyone test the dICO app - right now its  based on a COQUI setup - @siu plz fork it over to your repo. We will fully whitelabel it after this test. We will also add release-build instructions with electron-builder/packager and the installer build solution we are using for Agama (for enduser release) to the whitelabeled version. Next week atomicDEX project gets kickstarted - we are going to start with a standalone app that is based on the dICO app (same skelleton) - and later on we just port the "atomicDEX-view" into Agama. thats when @namhoang28 will fully start collaborating with @pbca26 (good introduction task into Agama codebase and views) - its also based on react. At this point the DEV-team also would like to announce that @pbca26 is now, with the growing GUI team, our official *GUI Lead Dev* [cc: @Audo @n2okpride @benohanlon - worth community ANN/FBF/etc. ?]

@pbca26 @namhoang28 congratulations. Would you like to do an AMA on what the dico app is / your focus etc...? It would mean we would write up a discussion guide and info. Does this mean dicos can be run without KMD team direct involvement?

[25-Sep-18 07:05 AM] phideas#8309
Just tested the dICO app. auto utxo split went ok. 2 swaps went ok.  3rd swap stuck at 4/6. my beer is stuck here and missing from wallet balance https://beer.kmdexplorer.io/address/bSAWZw33V6tz3MXWDNHAHwUy8SxytrCm1w
app restart didn't help. after a while i was able to start a new 4th swap.
but 3rd swap failed and beer missing. what to do in this case?

[25-Sep-18 10:15 AM] siu#3920
there seems to still be some issue regarding etomic marketmakers and some swaps not going through completely


[25-Sep-18 10:37 AM] ca333#0333
@siu is it dico app logic related issues or MM/bob? do we know that?


[25-Sep-18 10:37 AM] ca333#0333
there must be a way to prevent those cases gui-side


[25-Sep-18 10:37 AM] siu#3920
i ve been trying to figure out what it is


[25-Sep-18 10:37 AM] ca333#0333
can you explain me so maybe i can try to reproduce


[25-Sep-18 10:37 AM] siu#3920
i also believe it can be related to websocket


[25-Sep-18 10:38 AM] siu#3920
there are a couple of weird things.


[25-Sep-18 10:38 AM] siu#3920
first, the bobdeposit in the marketmaker server get stuck at 1/3 confirmation for too long


[25-Sep-18 10:39 AM] siu#3920
actually, i check the explorer and sometimes it has been on confirmation 9 on explorer while the node still shows waiting for 1/3 of bobdeposit


[25-Sep-18 10:39 AM] siu#3920
There is a problem there, because then the app actually jumps to `waiting for alice payment`


[25-Sep-18 10:39 AM] siu#3920
but the server is still waiting for bob deposit to confirm.


[25-Sep-18 10:40 AM] siu#3920
i updated nanomsg to see if that was the issue, but it keeps happenin randomly


[25-Sep-18 10:41 AM] siu#3920
@jl777c is there something that needs to be done on the bob side when alice is using websocket ?


[25-Sep-18 10:41 AM] siu#3920
or it doesnt have anything to do?


[25-Sep-18 10:42 AM] ca333#0333
i see - websocket is just for gathering swaprelated info afaik


[25-Sep-18 10:42 AM] ca333#0333
it shouldnt have any effect on trading, etc.


[25-Sep-18 10:43 AM] ca333#0333
we need to test marketmaker then if thats a issue we are able to reproduce


[25-Sep-18 10:43 AM] siu#3920
my servers are old too...


[25-Sep-18 10:43 AM] siu#3920
although i have reseted marketmakers completely a couple of times in history


[25-Sep-18 10:43 AM] siu#3920
and on every restart it build marketmaker


[25-Sep-18 10:44 AM] siu#3920
not `etomic` though


[25-Sep-18 10:44 AM] siu#3920
hmm... maybe i can try to set artems marketmakers on the server too


[25-Sep-18 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
websocket is just local logging of events


[25-Sep-18 10:53 AM] siu#3920
im setting artems marketmaker in the servers too


[25-Sep-18 10:53 AM] siu#3920

Ok, im out picking girls at school ans stuff


[25-Sep-18 11:52 AM] namhoang28#4328
@siu There is not much dICO can do when swap is happening. It just gather swap status and show it to user. But I still check the logic code again.


[25-Sep-18 11:56 AM] siu#3920
I understand... was just trying to think of reasons why this happens randomly


[25-Sep-18 11:57 AM] siu#3920
Right now, 50 minutes passed since i tried this swap and im still seeing this in the marketmaker output ```2 wait for bobdeposit bTwLA7ZfDpgcy2zktbZ3HbVUYaVquVEDVQ numconfs.3 COQUI 88b473aea838256b5c1afc959c1a33347c6608d43e13e0cd74443e2bc1bfce03```


[25-Sep-18 11:58 AM] siu#3920
maybe if i leave it running it will eventually jump to finish the swap


[25-Sep-18 11:58 AM] siu#3920
but this seems to definitively be an issue more on the server side.


[25-Sep-18 09:51 PM] ca333#0333
this shouldnt be happening. i am rebuilding a dev build with more MM related output


[25-Sep-18 09:51 PM] ca333#0333
lets find the real reason for this behaviour


[25-Sep-18 09:52 PM] ca333#0333
i reviewed the status check - its fine and not related to this issue


[26-Sep-18 12:33 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@ca333 @siu Seems like the issue is COQUI network is producing blocks too slow. According to MM log it waits for 3 confirmations but there are only 2.


[26-Sep-18 12:34 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
It should be either fixed from COQUI side or MM COQUI required confirmations should be set to 1.


[26-Sep-18 12:34 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
Ah, as I can see the required confirmations are reached, sorry.


[26-Sep-18 12:36 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
Is local COQUI node in sync and on right chain?


[26-Sep-18 01:31 AM] ca333#0333
it seems this is a local server-related issue @siu @artem.pikulin


[26-Sep-18 01:32 AM] ca333#0333
@siu can u test it on a fresh/solid server plz


[26-Sep-18 01:41 AM] SHossain#0007
@artem.pikulin yes, 3 confirmations needed for assetchains. @siu try running a tx generator. it helps


[26-Sep-18 02:40 AM] siu#3920
Its not coqui. The explorer shows that confirmations and blocks are being generate while the server is still waiting for the 1st confirmation


[26-Sep-18 02:42 AM] siu#3920
Let me see if i can set a new server


[26-Sep-18 10:53 AM] siu#3920
ok, guys, i got a new server and now we are getting 100% success rate

yes @namhoang28 - shared task info with you in DM. we are going to add all dICO App labels/strings to the config file. So it gets really easy for others to reuse the app. modifying logos/icons is easy enough already (replacing files). Once we have it fully whitelabeled we will write a small documentation for it.

@siu did you manage to run the dICO app with the coqui modifications?


[29-Sep-18 12:04 PM] phideas#8309
hey guys. i was curious what this app looks like so i tested it out a little bit, just like a normal end user.
the result i can tell you so far so good. latest version worked very reliably all swaps went through quick and smooth.
one thing i noticed there is a 10x smaller tx fee compared to agama. assuming it was made intentional.
maybe one suggestion though. for withdrawal it would be nice to have an "all" button which  also calculates the fee and empty the wallet, just like in agama.
good job guys, keep it up! üëç

I like your suggestion and it would be nice if you can open new issue on here(https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/dicoapp-e) so we can easy to keep track on it.
‚Ä®and also please help me to test the latest code on master again. I just fixed some bug and need someone help me to test it : D

@ca333  I just finished my current task and release new version of the app. It take more time than I thought so I‚Äôm going to work on while-label task on Monday (tomorrow). Will setup react-intl (https://github.com/yahoo/react-intl) for that task. It would takes one or two day of work.
Just let you know my work status if you have a plan or something.‚Ä®

thanks for the testing @phideas ! Some of dICO app logic will be reused for atomicDEX (shapeshift wallet) - the way the new price matrix is being created/calculated now will even boost the user-experience more. we will ping you all when the prototype is available.


[30-Sep-18 05:06 AM] ca333#0333
@namhoang28 thats fine - DM me your KMD address. So on wednesday or thursday we will run a final test with the fully whitelabeled app and then we start with the atomicDEX port. thank you

Hey guys,‚Ä®
Just finished white-label task and merged it to master branch. Now you can change the label\text in translation file(https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/dicoapp-e/blob/master/app/translations/en.json).

no problem üòÉ


[02-Oct-18 09:56 AM] ca333#0333
thanks @namhoang28!


[03-Oct-18 03:09 AM] ca333#0333
@siu did you already manage to create a dICO app fork with your own modifications ? (from whitelabeled to COQUI version)


[03-Oct-18 03:09 AM] ca333#0333
would be good to run one final test on all OS before closing this and initiating the atomicDEX port


[03-Oct-18 03:09 AM] siu#3920
Yes i did


[03-Oct-18 03:09 AM] ca333#0333
so was it all smooth and straight forward for you?


[03-Oct-18 03:09 AM] siu#3920
But got some issues with colors. Dumb things


[03-Oct-18 03:10 AM] ca333#0333
i see - what sort of issues? like modifying color-scheme, etc.?


[03-Oct-18 03:10 AM] siu#3920
Yeah. Most coin changes and logo changes where relatively easy


[03-Oct-18 03:10 AM] siu#3920
Yes, color scheme was more dificult


[03-Oct-18 03:12 AM] ca333#0333
ok - so its probably a good idea to add some color-vars to the config file - so anyone could actually just define the HTML color code in the config file to change the elements - probably stuff like fontcolors, color of view-background and menu-background, color of buttons (hover, active,etc. modes), etc.


[03-Oct-18 03:12 AM] ca333#0333
would this easen the process?


[03-Oct-18 03:12 AM] ca333#0333
@namhoang28 can we please make the color-scheme of the app configurable via a colorscheme.js config-file


[03-Oct-18 03:16 AM] ca333#0333
so the configfile will export the array with all colors. heres some pseudo-example:

```
colors: {
h1-wallet: #000,
h1-buy: #000,
walletfont:  #000,
wallet-button: #000,
login-button: #000,
login-bg: #000,
wallet-bg: #000,
menu-bg: #000
[...]
}
```


[03-Oct-18 03:16 AM] namhoang28#4328
uhm, there is a theme config file here but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs hard for end user‚Ä®

thanks!


[03-Oct-18 03:27 AM] namhoang28#4328
Do I need to specify color for each element in every page? because that will be huge task


[03-Oct-18 03:28 AM] namhoang28#4328
I suggest that we allow end user change theme in general


[03-Oct-18 03:29 AM] namhoang28#4328
like button color (primary/secondary), background for each page


[03-Oct-18 03:30 AM] namhoang28#4328
@siu what colors do you want to change in the app when you modify it?


[03-Oct-18 03:31 AM] namhoang28#4328
I can make it configurable


[03-Oct-18 04:00 AM] siu#3920
The buttons, loading stripe, menu items


[03-Oct-18 04:05 AM] namhoang28#4328
Do you want to specify color for button in each page? or just want to change it in general (apply in every page)


[03-Oct-18 04:44 AM] namhoang28#4328
Uhm, I think we should write a document about this. Because everything we want to change is ready there in ‚Ä®https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/dicoapp-e/blob/master/app/components/Theme/index.js file (button color, loading stripe, menu items).‚Ä®
It‚Äôs little bit harder with font since we have to go app page and add it (https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/dicoapp-e/blob/master/app/app.html#L7).‚Ä®
@siu Ping me when you are available and ready to work : )‚Ä®

A universal button color change should be  it


[03-Oct-18 04:49 AM] namhoang28#4328
uhm, I can't post picture in this channel but this config will be change the button color to blue light color:
```
const theme = createMuiTheme({
  palette: {
    type: 'light',
    primary: {
      // This is a main color for button
      main: '#4285f4',

  },
});
```


[03-Oct-18 04:53 AM] namhoang28#4328
I think we should write a document to guild user how to change


[03-Oct-18 04:54 AM] siu#3920
I can write a guide


[03-Oct-18 04:55 AM] namhoang28#4328
now? let's chat together


[03-Oct-18 05:04 AM] namhoang28#4328
@ca333 just find out everything we want to change is ready there in theme/index.js file.
We don't need to write any code to support it.
I will work with @siu to write a document to guild user
I think that is best solution (no code mean no bug : D)


[03-Oct-18 06:05 AM] ca333#0333
@namhoang28 general button mod should be enough - its just to give 3rd parties a chance to modify the visual part a little bit... @siu can say what elements he wants to be configurable color-wise.


[03-Oct-18 06:06 AM] ca333#0333
@siu please write the doc for the full modification (whitelabel -> COQUI) of the app if you have time for that.


[03-Oct-18 06:06 AM] siu#3920
yes, will do

keep the master branch whitelabeled plz - if you have a coqui specific version (for showcase or so) use a diff.  branch

i ll review it at and manually copy it over to the master branch together with a raw example config. we will keep the write-doc branch as the example/doc branch with ref. to the master branch readme. I ll take care on CI/CD and proper README for master branch after i hand you over the new atomic prototype - we re still going to change the split utxo procedure/func().

update - we are running a final internal test where chainmakers does a dico app port and release build for all OS - once the release builds are tested on all operating systems we know that every 3rd party serviceprovider or utilizing party is able to do this autonomous and without our intervention. It might also be worth adding the other steps for a successfull dICO App port like SPV server setup reference, etc. to have a complete dICO setup tutorial [cc: @siu @SHossain @namhoang28 ]

@ca333 my windows swap is getting stuck in Bob Deposit, can you verify what the marketmaker server is doing?


[06-Oct-18 07:58 AM] siu#3920

@siu can you please try it again with DSEC - i had some weird server-side behaviour. but it was pretty sure related to some experiments i did ran with the main DSEC bob. i moved it to the clean jl777 repo branch. server is gonna be back up within ~5 - 10 mins.

now i have this error


[06-Oct-18 12:58 PM] siu#3920
did you copy a fresh download of artem release?


[06-Oct-18 12:58 PM] SHossain#0007
i copied from barterDEX GUI repo


[06-Oct-18 12:59 PM] siu#3920
hmm


[06-Oct-18 01:00 PM] SHossain#0007
ok. artem's repo mm let me log in


[06-Oct-18 01:00 PM] siu#3920
everything? or just the marketmaker binary?


[06-Oct-18 01:00 PM] SHossain#0007
earlier i copied only `marketmaker.exe`. now used everything from artem's repo `mm-win.zip`


[06-Oct-18 01:01 PM] siu#3920
ok, great, that should do it.


[06-Oct-18 01:01 PM] ca333#0333
would be best to test this out of a release-build instead of dev-enviroment


[06-Oct-18 01:02 PM] SHossain#0007
true. second that

i unfortunately cant check the electrum server - anyone got access?


[06-Oct-18 02:00 PM] siu#3920
happens exactly the same with coqui


[06-Oct-18 02:01 PM] ca333#0333
weird - and only on windows, right?


[06-Oct-18 02:01 PM] siu#3920
yes


[06-Oct-18 02:01 PM] siu#3920
also i now tried with old marketmakers from another dicoapp release and the result it the same.


[06-Oct-18 02:03 PM] ca333#0333
maybe the way the windows marketmaker version does connect to the SPV servers is the problem. windows librariy ports are always a PITA - so it could potentially also be a windows related nanomsg issue and not MM. 

@jl777c is MM utilizing nanomsg for the SPV netcomm?


[06-Oct-18 02:04 PM] jl777c#5810
no nanomsg for SPV


[06-Oct-18 02:04 PM] ca333#0333
ok thanks


[06-Oct-18 02:10 PM] SHossain#0007
while the swap is stuck, only way to start another one is, by logging out and log back in.


[06-Oct-18 02:11 PM] SHossain#0007
can we keep the buy option enabled while another swap is happening?


[06-Oct-18 02:27 PM] namhoang28#4328
There is no way to detect the transaction is stuck or not by calling api recently‚Ä®
so we can‚Äôt enable buy button when swap is happening ```
can we keep the buy option enabled while another swap is happening?
```
‚Ä®Yes, we can implement it
but then we need a history of transactions and so on ‚Ä¶ : D
need a confirmation and I will try implement it @ca333 @SHossain  @siu


[06-Oct-18 02:28 PM] ca333#0333
yes its good to implement a persistent "buy-history" - the dico app prototype has this feature as well.

{Reactions}
üòç 

[06-Oct-18 02:29 PM] ca333#0333
we should only add a little rate-limiter


[06-Oct-18 02:29 PM] ca333#0333
i.e. 3 swaps per 1 minutes with min. 15 sec. in between or so


[06-Oct-18 02:29 PM] SHossain#0007
thank you. in this way, user don't have ot log out and log back in


[06-Oct-18 02:29 PM] ca333#0333
might need little fine-tuning


[06-Oct-18 02:29 PM] SHossain#0007
will save them some hassle


[06-Oct-18 02:31 PM] ca333#0333
also the dICO app prototype will automatically let you issue another swap after 3 minutes or when the swap is confirmed. either/or


[06-Oct-18 02:31 PM] ca333#0333
but never would get into a "locked" state


[06-Oct-18 02:33 PM] namhoang28#4328
noted, will think about it now
@pbca26 might have some experience about this : D


[06-Oct-18 02:35 PM] namhoang28#4328
he did it in agama wallet as well


[06-Oct-18 06:06 PM] siu#3920
im checking hyperdex to see if the issue is around the board


[07-Oct-18 10:53 PM] ca333#0333
@siu @namhoang28 had a talk to @artem.pikulin and i am now porting the atomicDEX prototype for usage with MM2 - we re getting there stabilitywise. Same for dICO app - @namhoang28 i am going to replace it with MM2 and see how that goes. Checking it serverside right now. will let you guys now when on it GUI side.


[07-Oct-18 11:05 PM] namhoang28#4328
Thanks @ca333 , I‚Äôm working on ‚Äùbuy-history" task now.
@siu can talk with @artem.pikulin  since he has more information about a bug (server logs and mm logs).
I confirmed that it only happened on win. I can make a swap successful on mac and @siu  can make it on linux.


[07-Oct-18 11:24 PM] ca333#0333
@namhoang28 what sort of "bug" ?


[07-Oct-18 11:25 PM] ca333#0333
not sure if siu is already using MM2... better to just keep testing the dico app and to extend it by whatever endusers and service providers want. In the meanwhile the devs are figuring to soluve the inconsistency issues on WIN.


[07-Oct-18 11:26 PM] ca333#0333
@namhoang28 MM2 is the new marketmaker based on the rust port of the barterDEX codebase. I think you miss this information.


[07-Oct-18 11:27 PM] namhoang28#4328
@ca333 yep, I miss that. Still use the old one : D


[07-Oct-18 11:28 PM] namhoang28#4328
where is the repo? I'm curious


[07-Oct-18 11:29 PM] ca333#0333
no worries. just keep using the current MM and work together with siu to get the dICO app visually to where we need it. The dev-repo is https://github.com/artemii235/SuperNET

we re still using MM1 -  i am changing some stuff slightly for usage with MM2


[08-Oct-18 06:03 AM] ca333#0333
give me a day to push the mods - have two more meetings today and team meeting later + reading an external security review


[08-Oct-18 06:04 AM] siu#3920
ok, no worries, just thought i could test it already


[09-Oct-18 10:43 PM] Mylo#8306
@grewalsatinder I think because rust is a Mozilla project.  Whether go and wasm will be a hit I think depends on dart/flutter success because google may put more resources to dart/flutter/wasm instead of go.

Hi everyone,

I just released¬†new version of the app. You can download it here <https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/dicoapp-e/releases/tag/v0.10.0> if you are using osx. For other os, please download and build it from develop branch<https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/dicoapp-e/tree/develop>.
‚Ä®New features:
- Allow user to make another swap when current swap is comfirmed
- Display history of swaps 
- Show details of a swap in modal

The next steps I'm going to work on:
- Redesign the wallet page, make it look better, simple and more¬†succinctly.
- Fixed bugs, try to resolve some technical debt 
- Call and handle http requests in difference thread because the browsers (renderer thread) limit number of simultaneous http requests (it‚Äôs 6 in chrome currently) (low priority)

Thank @siu for helping me test¬†out¬†the app. Happy weekend everyone : )

/ cc @ca333 @SHossain @siu

the app will be run faster when you run it in production mode
try to build it by run `npm run package:all` command and go to `release` folder.  There is .deb file for ubuntu in there


[19-Oct-18 09:21 AM] SHossain#0007
@namhoang28 current marketmaker from your repo doesn't work. same issue. used mm binary from BarterDEX repo and i can login


[19-Oct-18 09:22 AM] SHossain#0007
i used `yarn install` and `yarn dev` to run the app


[19-Oct-18 09:23 AM] cipi#4502
i would use the newest version from here: https://github.com/artemii235/SuperNET/releases
it also has overwinter/sapling support
i just a did a test with VOT, which has overwinter activated and it went fine
will add it to BarterDEX-GUI repo

Hi everyone,
I just released¬†new version of the app. If you use osx you can download it here <https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/dicoapp-e/releases/tag/v0.11.0>. For other os, please download and build it from develop branch<https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/dicoapp-e/tree/develop>.

Notable changes:
- Redesign the wallet page, make it look simpler and¬†succinctly.
    - Add Deposit modal, Withdraw modal
- User can withdraw all¬†their funds and empty their wallet
- Fix some bugs related withdraw and transactions

Starting from next week, I‚Äôm going to focus on atomic dex. I will discuss with @ca333  to get more informations and requirements.
Thank @siu @pbca26 @artem.pikulin  for helping me. Happy weekend everyone : )

@everyone @namhoang28 asked few questions and explanation on how atomicDEX gonna work - the answer could be essential info for all in here so i m posting it publicly:


[06-Nov-18 04:16 AM] ca333#0333
a) What is the goals of project? 
To provide non-technical users ("grandmas") a way to issue crosschain atomic swaps without any background knowledge. It should all happen the "shapeshift" way. 

b) what is the problem that we try to solve? 
There is no really simple way of doing atomic swaps. My dico app was the first app that allowed users to do swaps without any knowledge or knowing what relvol , basevol and maxvol would mean in such swaps. I want users to be able to just tell the app how much of tokens X they want to buy - the app should check balance, utxo scheme and proper available orders to swap against. The app should be taking care of everytrhing - the user of nothing. So obvisouly the problem is that doing dex trading is still to complicated for most users and not satisfying. 

c)Who will be the user of this app? 
No def. user group - from tech affiniate and developer to grandma and mentally handicapped ppl - everyone should be able to use AtomicDEX.

d) who will be early adopters?
Devs, team-members, testers. Majority probably community users and their friends/relatives - & noobs. 

e)What feature do we have in the application? 
   I) wallet funcs: receive, send, import/export privkey/seed, encrypt/decrypt wallet.dat for all supported tokens
  II) trade funcs: buy token X with user defined token Y


[06-Nov-18 04:17 AM] ca333#0333
III) AtomicDEX backend engine: needs to properly handle/split utxos on a case by case algo, precalc the available funds and if the user defined buy-amount can even be bought, etc. Literally the dICO app with ehanced utxo handling - the buy part is "almost" unchanged and very simple to modify/takeover from the dico app - to get this done will take you 10 minutes with testing. Example on how this is going to be modified/handled you can see here in my dico prototype mod https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/dicoapp/commit/09b6c04685c1c13fedd30607b784e958e958beef - this commit should make all necessary modifications clear. As for the utxo handling part - we are going to do it this way (atomicDEX buy scenario):

[06-Nov-18 04:17 AM] ca333#0333
**Scenario**

1) User defines amount of Tokens X that he wants to buy and the type of Tokens Y that he want to spend for X (X = bobcoin in the codes, since this is what we want "from the bob" and Y = alicecoin in the codes since this is what we have) - (you can also check the atomicDEX mockup that i shared here some time ago)


[06-Nov-18 04:17 AM] ca333#0333
2) now the atomicDEX engine checks if this is possible (balance calc based on the price and vol calc - if good to go the atomicDEX engine will first check the available utxos - their value and how the ratio does fit. If it does reflect 1/777 utxo for the fee split and the calculated relvol, then its good to go. If not then atomicDEX engine has to generate a transaction to yourself ("sendmany" styled with multiple tx outputs) where each TX output reflects one element of the necessary alice utxos (fee, vol) also make sure you have enough TX fee added to this key! (the swap = more than 1 TX!!)


[06-Nov-18 04:18 AM] ca333#0333
In this step the atomicDEX app has to inform the user about the split (if such a split-tx takes place at all) - for this time its good to lock all wallet-funcs and to automatically issue the swap once the split is done to ensure a swap-success. 
With the dICO App prototype we were all able to do 100% swap success during the initial tests last year (first dICO rounds) - so i am pretty sure that if we keep the same logic in the buy side and enhance gthe engine by the above funcs that we ll be able to provide the most robust and advanced DEX tech/enduser app to the masses. 
BDEX v1.0 has already been able to provide almost 100% swap success around a year ago - with bdex 2.0 we ll def. hit the 100%.


[06-Nov-18 04:18 AM] ca333#0333
**Also important to add that what you put into something is also what you get out - we need properly trained and tech aff. ppl to run bobs/spv nodes etc. Otherwise you ll only see ppl complaining bout tech hear "tech doesnt work, blablabla"**


[06-Nov-18 04:42 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@ca333 Hi, I noticed that dICO GUI app possibly works directly with available UTXOs. This might conflict with refactoring plan that we have for MM2, here are 2 main points:
1. Input UTXO handling during tx creation must be refactored in order to provide universal way of UTXO selection especially in case of small amount of big utxos. Here is the issue describing the general idea: https://github.com/artemii235/SuperNET/issues/157
2. Specific technical implementation of coins must be encapsulated on MM level providing a public interface for external interaction - every coin has a balance, tx history etc. However GUI shouldn't rely on specific protocol (UTXO) - it'll complicate integration of other protocol coins (like ETH and many others which have different non-UTXO implementation). The good example of problems caused by UTXO-only dependency is MM1 ETH integration - the additional proxy coin (ETOMIC) is required for ETH/ERC20 swaps now, but we can get rid of it. We also have to support things like ETOMIC faucet adding extra point of failure - faucet can be drained, down, etc.

@artemciy_dice Also pointed there that it might be useful to provide "low level" info about transactions - like what utxo was selected for swap etc. I agree with it but I think that it should be only on "info" level, GUI shouldn't rely on UTXO to display orderbook, broadcast order, etc.
Please share your thoughts about it üòÉ


[06-Nov-18 04:58 AM] ca333#0333
excellent - thanks a lot for the info @artem.pikulin - in this case we will exclude utxo handling and rely on MM2 for this


[06-Nov-18 04:58 AM] ca333#0333
i vote your proposal up - its def. a good idea to have this being part of the MM internal processings


[06-Nov-18 04:59 AM] ca333#0333
so GUI only takes care on GUI related stuff - i.e. mapping using inputs over to MM2


[06-Nov-18 05:06 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@ca333 Thanks! The refactoring plan is already being implemented. UTXO selection and validation on order broadcasting/validation  was removed and it even works üôÇ


[06-Nov-18 05:09 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
I'm kind of excited that this has been already prototyped in dICO. @artem.pikulin was working on this lately and IMHO it's nice to have a proof of concept at hand, and it's nice that we can do this kind of stuff from GUIs. In the long run though, it should be better to implement this in the MM (on the v2 branch) in order to be able to make better decisions when, for instance, the list of UTXOs changes (maybe there are fresh updates from the wallet, or maybe the user is doing something else in background). Preselecting UTXOs in GUI might introduce extra points of failure, might slow down trade retries and complicate the automatic testing and debugging of such trades.

`> But i refer low level of api. It make me feel more control and know how the code work hehe`

I'd rather second that, there is value in keeping the low level API available, in order to make it easier to test and prototype different algorithms. Per PDIA (Problem-Driven Iterative Adaptation, a process which I came to respect) we should authorize positive deviation and let the good solutions spread through diffusion.


[06-Nov-18 05:19 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
On our side we'll strive to exploit the advantages of the MM2-integrated solution in order to make it faster and more reliable.  D

ps this has been a great read. thank yo


[06-Nov-18 08:03 AM] namhoang28#4328
I haven‚Äôt read all comments yet so maybe I can misunderstand something but I agreed with @artemciy_dice 
We should make the GUI easy to use but not in API. The api should be ‚Äúpure‚Äù, detail, transparent and do one thing.
For example, buy api can split into 2 api: buy and splitting utxos (low level)
Of course, there will be more code in GUI level and more roundtrip but it‚Äôs not big a problem since we run mm app locally.
And it‚Äôs easy for someone (not hyper app, not dico app) want to build app on top of marketmaker app.
Maybe they have different UI, different process and different requirements.
Bitcoin and ECR20 are different resource. Let's create different api for it üòÑ


[06-Nov-18 08:18 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
@namhoang28 , the atomic swap does a lot behind the scenes, I doubt the "do one thing" UNIX philosophy is applicable here, it's like saying that a database APIs should "do one thing" and stop at fetching a block from the disk, or writing it back, and the database client will implement the rest of the SQL and ACID. Having a low-level API is good for prototyping and experimenting with algorithms (kind of like having a Python interface to Tensorflow), but after the prototyping the best Real Thing should then be implemented natively in the underlying trade server (MM).


[06-Nov-18 08:22 AM] namhoang28#4328
Yep, there is no best options but I think we talk about restful api.
I see many benefit if we keep mm api in low level. This is my opinion : D


[06-Nov-18 08:33 AM] namhoang28#4328
what I mean "do one thing" is if I call buy api, it simply processes an order.
If it found not enough tx, it should throw new error
now it do more than one thing in buy api


[06-Nov-18 08:37 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
@namhoang28 , I really appreciate your eagerness to go into the nitty-gritty details of the atomic swaps! I think we'll benefit from more eyes.

I think that the "low level" API might have been a misnomer though. What we have is a high level API where you're placing a buying or a selling order, then things like joining UTXOs, performing the steps of the atomic swap, everything happens inside the MM.

Maybe we should chunk down and see what particular parts of the UTXO-related APIs you'd like us to preserve?

`> now it do more than one thing in buy api`

Interesting. What operations you'd like to see separated from the buy API?


[06-Nov-18 08:55 AM] namhoang28#4328
This is the code when you want to splitting utxos. It call same buy api. I personally don't like it. We should have splitting utxos api:
```
https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/dicoapp-e/blob/master/app/containers/BuyPage/saga/load-buy-coin-process.js#L85
```
```
 things like joining UTXOs, performing the steps of the atomic swap, everything happens inside the MM.```
I think this is low level of UTOX resource.
But treating bitcoin(other coins) and ECR20 like same resource is not good idea. It good idea in GUI level but not good idea in API level. This is my opinion. Do what you think right since my knowledge of blockchain is not good : D


[06-Nov-18 09:05 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
Makes sense, if the user interface performs the splitting as a separate step then we might benefit from having a dedicated splitting API. Please feel free to add this at https://github.com/artemii235/SuperNET/issues.

`> But treating bitcoin(other coins) and ECR20 like same resource is not good idea.`

We'll take another look at this, thanks.

@namhoang28 Hi, on MM level we don't treat different coins as same resource. However it might be essential for top level software to be able to work with any coin using same API methods as some actions are same by the nature: getBalance, getTxHistory, sendTransaction, etc. It's like the task with tx history: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/dicoapp-e/issues/64#issuecomment-432137489. Even UTXO coins provide different API for tx history in native/electrum modes, but you like to use only 1 API method (listtransactions) getting the same response format.
Same thing we want to do in MM2. Moreover it was said few messages above that UTXO related code on ordermatching (which includes buy method) is already being removed because it makes hard to support other coins like ETH.
So it's already planned that `buy` method won't do any splitting - it won't even know what UTXO is because specific implementation will be incapsulated on lower level. Buy method will check that address has sufficient balance to place the order and that's it.

And UTXO handling algorithm will be changed significantly, you won't need to do any preparation before `buy` request. So I don't think that there will be UTXO splitting API because it's simply not required.


[06-Nov-18 09:10 PM] namhoang28#4328
thanks @artem.pikulin , good point.
I can understand why buy method do splitting utox in it. It‚Äôs because there is a same team who work on both UI and marketmaker app. But now there is at least three project build on top mm app (hyper, dico, barterdex). It good if we can keep the api in low level : D

[06-Nov-18 09:20 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
We're trying to keep existing API as same as possible so GUI teams don't need to do huge refactoring. For this particular case you don't need to implement UTXO split on GUI level, we want to make your life simplier üòÉ

@Mylo Hi, there is no specific instruction how to run nightly builds of MM2. It should work same way as MM1 as we're trying to keep config, API, etc. same for now to simplify MM2 usage for existing GUIs. So you just need to download the nightly binary http://195.201.0.6/etomic/ (or build it from source https://github.com/artemii235/SuperNET/tree/etomic) and replace your existing MM1 binary keeping config same. Please note that it mostly keeps all features (and bugs) same and even can have more bugs so I'd recommend to use it very carefully and with testcoins only and on private netid.

ok


[13-Feb-19 12:46 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Oh, didn't see this. 

I'm putting together a more comprehensive history of your involvement with atomic swaps.


[13-Feb-19 12:46 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Did you save and/or post the code that you used to perform your original atomic swap?


[13-Feb-19 12:46 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
The one in 2014 between NXT assets?


[13-Feb-19 12:48 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Also, same question for the BTC <--> NXT asset you did in 2015.


[13-Feb-19 12:58 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@jl777c 

Also, I see this transaction here as the first from the DEX address on BTC chain.

What kind of information can an independent third-party observer get from this address?

Is there by chance any data that we have that would show what atomic swaps occurred?


[13-Feb-19 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
data would need to be dug up on the NXT blockchain


[13-Feb-19 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
InstantDEX even had a GUI and was doing atomic swaps


[13-Feb-19 12:59 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442

[13-Feb-19 01:08 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
As I'm thinking about how I want to put together this story, here are a few thoughts about what would be good to have. 

Naturally, some things we may just not have, and that's okay. But the more data and proof we can find, the better.

First NXT asset atomic swap:
* The code that you wrote in 2014 that successfully completed your first asset-asset atomic swap
* The txids of that swap
* Any blockchain-stored hashes of data at that time that can prove that those transactions were what we say they are
* Any Github timestamps that show when your code was uploaded.
* Links to the places in social media/online forum accounts where your conversations occurred during this time period.

First NXT <--> BTC atomic swap
* All the same data

First atomic swap on Instant DEX
* Same

First atomic swap as a part of the Komodo project
* Same

First atomic swap using public DEX for Komodo
* Same


[13-Feb-19 01:08 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442

Here's a comment you made in response to something said by klee, the NXT core dev:

```Quote from: klee on September 16, 2014, 05:16:11 PM
Proposal:

What about seeding NEW coins being developed with unique features? Devs could make their proposals and maybe one or more are chosen for funding.
```

This is huge in so many ways..
Exactly.

This is how Atomic was born

James


[20-Feb-19 09:19 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Did this have anything to do with atomic swaps?


[20-Feb-19 09:21 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Another quote of yours:

```
Originally Atomic was proposed to me as a coin, but the nature of it made the "coinness" not the most efficient technical implementation and a more on-demand format was better. So we agreed to make it into a DAC, at least the ultimate form of it. The initial versions would probably be not quite 100% DAC
```

I'm guessing there's more info on NXT forums; I have not yet had time to review those forums. Trying to stay with BTT until I get the full scope of how you came to atomic swaps.


[20-Feb-19 09:26 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
A ha, finally, a full explanation on BTT.

Yes, this looks wholly relevant, I believe.

Did the "Telepathy" stuff you did with BTCD have anything to do with the DEX/atomic swap tech?

I need to ask you about transaction malleability


[24-Feb-19 01:18 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
I read through the BTT discussions on ACCT's


[24-Feb-19 01:18 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
It seems that in your first attempts, in 2014, you were acting in solo and you created on-chain atomic transfers between NXT assets as a proof of concept


[24-Feb-19 01:19 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
At that time, Tier Nolan (from what I've read), had ACCT's working on a test net, but due to transaction malleability, it was not possible to safely conduct these in the open


[24-Feb-19 01:19 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Does that sound about right to you?


[24-Feb-19 01:52 PM] jl777c#5810
yes


[24-Feb-19 01:56 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Help me understand transaction malleability. 

I've read the material on the discussions, but it's a bit too technical for me.

The basic idea is that, without modern (current) features, the transaction that a user sends to the mempool may not be the transaction that is included in the block.

Is that correct?


[24-Feb-19 02:11 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@jl777c


[24-Feb-19 09:28 PM] jl777c#5810
yes.


[24-Feb-19 09:28 PM] jl777c#5810
a transaction has a bunch of bytes in it


[24-Feb-19 09:29 PM] jl777c#5810
but it doesnt include its own txid


[24-Feb-19 09:29 PM] jl777c#5810
the txid is based on the hash of the bytes of the transaction that get confirmed


[24-Feb-19 09:30 PM] jl777c#5810
this is not a problem, except that it was possible to change some bytes (even insert new ones) into the rawtx and still have the signature be valid


[24-Feb-19 09:30 PM] jl777c#5810
so with a valid signature, it is a valid tx. with different bytes, it is s a different txid


[24-Feb-19 09:30 PM] jl777c#5810
if you were expecting txid to get to the blockchain, it wont ever get there


[24-Feb-19 09:31 PM] jl777c#5810
this requires node with better connectivity than your node to intercept your tx from the network, modify it and broadcast it faster to the network, so by the time the real tx gets to a node, it rejects it as an attempted double spend

I think an important part of the research is that all these projects who are claiming to have done "their first atomic swap" are years behind the original atomic-swap enthusiasts.

We are even behind them, as well. 

I'd rather put the focus on user adoption, because that's race in which we need to win anyway, and it's the race that we're currently winning (but only "just").

yeah, and we are building an open backend for unlimited amount of DEX frontends


[25-Feb-19 11:21 AM] Audo#5667
it's not like we want to build a closed product and have control over everything


[25-Feb-19 11:31 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Right. I think we should focus on user count, not on who did the first swap.

If we win the user race, we don't need to worry about the other one.

Just read through the doc, great work @Bryan_Beus !

My only suggestion is to create a second, short and sweet timeline version that starts with dates

Maybe something like 

July 2012 -- Sergio Demian Lerner introduces the concept of a direct, peer-to-peer cryptocurrency trading protocol (w/ link to the original post)

April 2013 -- Tier Nolan describes the logic of a peer-to-peer swap (w/ link to original post)

etc, etc, all the way to the present day

^ I imagine something like this will be more helpful for Wachsman and the writers they want to distribute it to


[26-Feb-19 01:08 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Just the dates, the significance of the event that happened on that date, and the link to verify it


[26-Feb-19 08:11 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Sounds good
