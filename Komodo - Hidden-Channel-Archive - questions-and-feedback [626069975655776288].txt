This is a temporary channel to get feedback from our community. We got new community guidelines and we are defining a good moderation policy that makes everyone happy.

We are also thinking if there's any way to reduce the amount of channels. Probably not :abusedsmily: 

Drop your feedback & ideas here


[24-Sep-19 09:50 AM] phm87#7395
I noticed that most of conversations on #📈┃talk-trading  are not related to trading. I found no channel in such state


[24-Sep-19 10:13 AM] mrlynch#5735
not that different to a real life trading floor though


[24-Sep-19 10:16 AM] phm87#7395
Yes but I know more serious trading communities where such msgs can be deleted. Crypto funds and investors. Anyway, I won't fight to fix this : I learn trading stuff elsewhere and not on kmd discord


[24-Sep-19 10:17 AM] phm87#7395
Guys such as siu and markus can help ppl (to see if a TA is valid or invalidated). They are helping ppl and teaching. But these msgs are lost in all unrelated msgs


[24-Sep-19 10:18 AM] phm87#7395
In the traders community I am talking about, they have 2 trading channels: talk-crypto and TA. TA should contain only TA


[24-Sep-19 10:18 AM] mrlynch#5735
the only solution is.... more channels :troll:


[24-Sep-19 10:18 AM] phm87#7395
I agree


[24-Sep-19 10:19 AM] phm87#7395
Or maybe push ppl in offtopic or general or use another random channel to discuss


[24-Sep-19 10:19 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Technical trading <> Trading general


[24-Sep-19 10:19 AM] Cryptoon#3362
could be an option for two trading chans


[24-Sep-19 10:19 AM] phm87#7395
I agree


[24-Sep-19 10:19 AM] phm87#7395
I vote for 1200 new channels


[24-Sep-19 10:20 AM] Cryptoon#3362
where trading general can be the loosely moderated trading channel that has existed since the slack times etc


[24-Sep-19 10:20 AM] Cryptoon#3362
and trading technical where you can talk fib and EMA levels :p


[24-Sep-19 10:20 AM] phm87#7395
I read a suggestion to have a bot trading channel for dev who trade with bots


[24-Sep-19 10:20 AM] mrlynch#5735
there was one, nobody used it i think


[24-Sep-19 10:22 AM] mrlynch#5735
#dev-tradebots <- #dev-marketmaker


[24-Sep-19 10:23 AM] jorian#4555
the chat style in #📈┃talk-trading is probably a remnant of the Slack era, where the trading channel there was a place to discuss a lot more than just trading


[24-Sep-19 10:24 AM] jorian#4555
also #general in Slack was a nice place to discuss all general things SuperNET / komodo


[24-Sep-19 10:24 AM] jorian#4555
can't really describe why that is


[24-Sep-19 10:27 AM] xeonrider#3120
I find it quite hostile in trading not sure what is going on there but it surely isnt about trading


[24-Sep-19 10:28 AM] xeonrider#3120
and... way too many channels


[24-Sep-19 10:30 AM] Audo#5667

guyse am i the only one who thinks we have too many chats in this discord? maybe it would be nice to have seperate discords for some branches and only keep the top topics here, maybe link the subchannels here to an outsourced discord? idk, but scrolling through the channels is getting somehow overwhelming, even tho it is neatly structured, for me its getting bin hard to overlook the topics im intrested in.


[24-Sep-19 10:35 AM] Audo#5667
do the channels at the very bottom get in way too? Like for example we have tons of ecosystem project channels.


[24-Sep-19 10:39 AM] twittler#0062
not necessarily but its bit hard to over look all this, especially for new members i think

@Audo there are archived ones. Unless there is an option now in discord to mute every channel

@twittler you are right, but than again Komodo tech isnt really easy for someone new

imo, 2 ecosystem headers would be nice
maybe "Ecosystem Projects" for those that do live here and "Ecosystem Extensions" (or something along that line) for those that are here and somewhere else?


[24-Sep-19 11:36 AM] twittler#0062
@xeonrider but i think we also want to grow the community. some ppl just want to invest and see the developement and news, others may start their own project at somepoint. maybe dev topics and general topics could be separated, idk, komodo is developing so quickly its hard to follow up unless the surrounding structure gets updated aswell to make it easy for newbs to find an entrance point and satisfying userexperience. it takes couple hours to overview the project to someone new, maybe that could be a good starting point.


[24-Sep-19 11:38 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`to make it easy for newbs to find an entrance point`
Having watched all the growth from just a handful of channels when we moved over here, I've often wondered the challenge level of coming here new


[24-Sep-19 11:50 AM] xeonrider#3120
the entrance point is not the issue. You simply don't really get ahead without being at the mercy of people who might know something. I just like being able to do the basics on my own instead of throwing myself at the mercy of other people who "might" be in a good mood to help out or get referred to rtfm or "go slowly".


[24-Sep-19 11:50 AM] xeonrider#3120
just my 2 cents


[24-Sep-19 11:56 AM] twittler#0062
growing the community is the issue as i see it, from ethusiast and businessrelated pov, but the question is who is the targeting group and how to attract them. cus the tech is good imo.


[24-Sep-19 06:34 PM] Mixic 🐬#3188
Well done, guys! Glad to see that Komodo always thinks about his community 🙂 👍


[24-Sep-19 07:36 PM] actionslacks#4072
I agree with the move to raise the general quality of what gets posted on this discord. It also seems like an inordinate amount of posts are just people complaining. Constructive criticism ie "I think X is a little weak, we should try Y to make X better" is a lot better than "kmd is a total shitcoin and your team sucks". People often just come in here to troll everyone and there should be some threshold where people who are being dicks will be muted or kicked, even temporarily. No one needs it. It just lowers morale. This is an open project, but that doesn't mean that anyone should be able to come here and spread their psychic waste because they're frustrated.


[25-Sep-19 12:33 AM] Surfer007#0709
Good initiative !! What I would like Komodo to promote as a multifunctional platform for upcoming projects. Also to point out already existing ERC-20 projects on the clear advantages of komodo and also to offer guidance including supporters for a change (Chainzilla ...). A graphic representation would set the ball rolling and komodo would be in the minds of devs and investors.

when I used to run a chat back in the GPRS WAP days we had a room called "Prison" people who got sent to prison could not come out until they "did their time" but in the prison, they could rant without rules, and only "inmates" were allowed in that room. 
It worked really well, but I don't know if this is possible on Discord unless you manually assign a "prisoner" role to said people and then manually remove it.


[26-Sep-19 02:17 PM] Oszy#5734
we had it coded, maybe a discord bot can manage this the same way, so after X minutes it removes the role, and the role would make the person only able to see / write in that single room

What if (and I realize this is a really radical idea) people saw the name of someone they didn't like and just choose to not read the words that follow that name....


[26-Sep-19 02:24 PM] Oszy#5734
It's not about who you like but what they write, and for that you have to read what they wrote 😛 
Blocking someone hides the messages too, but that doesn't stop them flooding the channel with irrelevant or offensive chat.

[27-Sep-19 02:44 AM] Audo#5667
haha, interesting idea @Oszy 

That would be possible actually, but maybe the current solution is a bit better though.

Right now mods can 'timeout' people for x number of minutes, making them unable to chat (but they can read).

In my part of the world saying wtf is not ban worthy. It's more of a colloquial expression. Calling some one mean names such as @#$&, or a string of demeaning curse words is however ban worthy.

The decision was made after reading the message history. We won't be banning people too easily in general, but there have been a number of people who have caused problems and we take a more strict line now to set a proper moderation standard.

Many people work hard to build up this project, and we don't need people here who never contribute to the conversation but only cause problems.


[28-Sep-19 08:27 AM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
Agree. I appreciate the case by case common sense approach and explanation of actions taken.


[28-Sep-19 08:29 AM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
Hopefully though, a cool down time out ban is also implemented as sanity is often governed by external forces and most times rest and food are the cure.

a "cool down time" tends to just make someone that's mad sit and write and entire text wall instead of being in context (in my experience)

@Audo 
I'm not sure how to better explain it, but you're still missing my point.
that you said x was *also* the reason, in some channel that the person will likely never go into, doesn't change what he can screenshot what the bot told him
```
YAGPDB.xyzBOT 10/31/2019
Komodo: You have been :mute:Muted (Expires after: 10 minutes)
Reason: repeating complaints atomicdex everywhere```
makes for a __horrible__ screenshot when it comes to PR and the dude telling everyone that will listen that he got mute just because he was confused and couldn't get help
no one outside of this discord is going to see that you said something in addition to that in a given team channel


[31-Oct-19 06:33 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
From a PR stance, the "reason" used needs to be something that "you don't know the whole story" doesn't need to be said, imo


[31-Oct-19 06:34 AM] Audo#5667
Moderating is not easy, let's just show some support to our mods that try to help.

If you mean that @Farl should also have added that the guy called a team member a scammer then yes, that would have been a good addition to the reason.


[31-Oct-19 06:34 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
yes, that was what I was getting at


[31-Oct-19 06:35 AM] Audo#5667
ok, it's good input, thanks @ComputerGenie .

@Community Moderator let's type out the 'reason' carefully from now on as that is what most of the community sees. Otherwise people might be alarmed that we mute or warn people too easily.

This channel can now be used to discuss Komodo Community Portal related feedback and ideas as well.


[20-Jan-20 08:27 PM] Audo#5667
(I renamed it from "discord-feedback" to"community-feedback")


[20-Jan-20 09:24 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
My feedback is that if mods are going to mute community members because the mod got their feelings hurt when the mod wrongfully muted a project owner in the project channel and the community member came to defense of that project owner, then eventually there will not be anyone but mods and subjugated sheeple left in what will no longer resemble a "community" after some time


[20-Jan-20 09:33 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
Forget, for a moment, that I am me
Take a step back and reread the events of my latest muting __in context__
That had more to do with a mod's "feelz" than any community guidelines in even the most absurd of communities
Only a level of hubris that will do more harm than good would allow a community member to be acted upon in such a revengeful manner as to punish them for speaking out and saying it's wrong to enter into a project channel and tell the project owner they are being punished for "unnecessary quarrel"


[20-Jan-20 11:21 PM] Audo#5667
I hear you @ComputerGenie , but muting someone for a personal attack is very much within the line of our moderation policy. There was a misunderstanding, but still there is no need for pointing fingers, escalating, or ridiculing others.

There will always be missunderstandings and conflicts, and that is part of an online community. Nonetheless, we need to find better ways to deal with them than a long text battle on a public channel. The two main things that we are asking everyone to follow:

- no personal attacks or insults, even if you are right. Treat others with repsect even when you disagree with them and think they are in the wrong.
- no drawn out off-topic debates on public channels, even if there are no clear personal insults involved


[21-Jan-20 12:42 AM] hastrup#8742
@Audo well said I totally agree 👍


[21-Jan-20 04:00 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
If the "moderation policy" is that "power-tripping" is a "personal attack" then I completely stand behind what I said about it ruining the remainder of the "community". Human beings are not designed to never have opinions and to never express them. 🤷🏽‍♂️

Yes, and their people feel as oppressed and persecuted as some here do.


[21-Jan-20 04:27 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
Jokes aside, I still feel that it is detrimental to building a "community" for what I said, in the context that it was said in, to incur punishment. (specifically look at if it would have received the same punishment were it said by personX, person,Y, or personZ)
Actually punishing people for sarcasm is a step too far for a "community"
It will, however, build a bland business environment where people hate their overlords (and yes "you **will** show me respect just because I have a title" makes one an overlord).


[21-Jan-20 04:33 AM] hastrup#8742
I understand what you are trying to say. But I will give a warning if someone  is using tearms: like fucktard stupid or donkey directly at somone. That does not help anything


[21-Jan-20 04:35 AM] ComputerGenie#7004

[21-Jan-20 04:37 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
We can tackle the "we let friends say things" bit too, but my main concern is that the larger problem is yesterday's events and the worst bits of it as it concerns a global policy are being overlooked because it specifically involved me


[21-Jan-20 04:39 AM] hastrup#8742

[21-Jan-20 04:40 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
Had post I made been made by Alright or mrlynch, or anyone, would he have received punishment? 
If so, then it's a policy step too far
If not, then it's a poor standard to apply arbitrarily because of "hurt feelings"


[21-Jan-20 06:32 AM] hastrup#8742
the community moderator role is still a new thing and it will take time to adjust to it, and there will be paper cuts along the way. I understand your concern that some can have a bias towards you
Like you said in your nn proposal: some like me some hate me “paraphrasing” 
And horns well meet sometimes and that is alright 
the issue is when A calls B a cunt/stupid that is not a healthy way to arguer and that will get a warning
and there was one time yesterday where you call someone something similar. 
and i have not whiteness mrlynch or alright have call someone cunt/stupid or something similar
but again the moderator group is still learning and we value your input.


[21-Jan-20 06:37 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`and there was one time yesterday where you call someone something similar. `
see, that's where context matters the most and mods need to view the larger picture
I gave two "if...then" statements
he agreed with the first
which made the second moot
that you are stuck on the second means that you are not seeing the context of the statement and hinging on single selective words
Until the mods got involved, no one interpreted that as me calling him an idiot, moron, or whatever noun I used in the sentence because they read the context of the conversation


[21-Jan-20 06:41 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`and i have not whiteness mrlynch or alright have call someone cunt/stupid or something similar`
while I don't recall the former doing so, I assure you there are several examples of the latter doing just that
and if you're using that word as an example of me, that goes to an even larger issue of moderating speech that isn't even on this server (as the time I used that word [until the recipient of it used it here twice] was on a completely different server and **totally** out of the jurisdiction of **any** mod here and shouldn't even be part of any discussion here)


[21-Jan-20 06:45 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
and also, I didn't use it in the context of the example I put forth with their names nor was any language in that even similar
that so many things carry baggage and refuse to involve context is, indeed, much of the larger issue


[21-Jan-20 06:48 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
In context, the phrase was "Power-tripping" and it was used in the context of a mod coming into a channel and telling the channel owner that the owner was to be punished of "unnecessary quarrel"
please stick to that context and not devolve it into some fiction


[21-Jan-20 06:56 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
For clarity:
The sole reason for mentioning either of them was to point out that if either of them saw what I saw and said "Power-tripping mod" they would not have been punished for "being disrespectful to decision moderator"
again, it's all about context


[21-Jan-20 07:02 AM] hastrup#8742
context matters that we do agree on. but one does not have to use derogatory term against someone because whatever reason. 
If so, then it has 100% liquidity
If not, then you're a feken idiot

whit your way whit words you could have phrase it different.

@ComputerGenie you were publicly pointing fingers and ridiculing Farl for his efforts moderate. If some other person would out of the blue have said exactly what you said, yes, maybe it wouldn't have resulted an instant mute. However, each person has a history and your past actions affect how people treat you in the future.

People are not robots, and the same situation can be perceived in different ways depending on who is involved. If someone has received numerous warnings in the psat of course he gets different treatment than a first timer. Let's just try to be understanding and improve our relationship from here on out.


[21-Jan-20 07:09 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`However, each person has a history and your past actions affect how people treat you in the future.`
In the part of the world I live in, that's called "bias" and one acting with unfettered discretion as instantaneous judge, jury, and executioner should refrain from such emotional feelings as to bring out of context baggage with them.
No, people are not robots, nor do I expect them to be, but my point is that if no one says something then it will be worse for all of us in the future.
`Let's just try to be understanding and improve our relationship from here on out.`
Every reason I'm writing here instead of the devolving actions/words I imagine some might expect.

`whit your way whit words you could have phrase it different.`
I'm sure I *could* phrase 100 gajillion things in life differently, but we live in the real world and people say real things.
I do, however, stand by the belief that only a stupid person would pass on accepting $72 million USD to *not* say a specific thing after that thing is shown to be wrong 🤷🏽‍♂️


[21-Jan-20 07:13 AM] Audo#5667
I am just saying how things work in the real world, people do judge you on your past actions and there is always bias


[21-Jan-20 07:14 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`If a person commits the exact same crime twice he tends to get a harder sentence on the second time.`
That we agree there are those in the community that could have said the exact same words in the exact same context without it being deemed "disrespectful" should mean that we should agree that it's not a crime to get a sentence for


[21-Jan-20 07:15 AM] ComputerGenie#7004

Regarding the Community Portal, the difference between a comment and an answer on a Question is not really clear to me. Look at this Question for example: https://community.komodoplatform.com/question/5e2616dedf23747246e2a10b/answer


[21-Jan-20 12:54 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
`It all comes down to people being buthurt to soon`
well I wanted to say that to begin with, but was trying to be "respectful"


[21-Jan-20 06:49 PM] gcharang#6833
@Farl normal questions will have both comments and answers
the question you pointed to is a poll. so it has options to select from and comments


[21-Jan-20 10:01 PM] Farl#9964
My point was about that a Question post needs an Answer and a Discussion post a Comment.  Now there are too many choices imo, a bit intransient. I like the KISS approach. 💋


[21-Jan-20 10:09 PM] Farl#9964
With my poll Question there is even an extra option which is Vote description. So three comment options, a bit too many imho.

[22-Jan-20 02:05 AM] Audo#5667
yeah I agree @Farl , it's a bit confusing and I too first just 'commented' on a question when I wanted to answer it. 

I guess with a comment you can provide some insight into the matter, or just have a normla discussion. Answer is like a bigger "comment" where you try your best to answer the questions as well as you can. Each person can only post one answer per question. 

Answers can be upvoted by liking them.


[22-Jan-20 02:05 AM] Audo#5667
_ _
The comments are indeed quite hidden too, I didn't even notice you had left a comment until now.


[22-Jan-20 02:06 AM] Audo#5667
_ _
To me it looks like "Vote description" == "answer"


[22-Jan-20 02:12 AM] gcharang#6833
most question/answer sites have comments + answers
answers should directly answer the question
comments can be about anything. like suggestions to make the question better or if you are unsure of the answer, can leave your thoughts in the comments


[22-Jan-20 02:13 AM] Farl#9964
Thanks for sharing your opinion guys. we can leave them as it is of course.


[22-Jan-20 02:16 AM] Farl#9964
It's not very clear that answers can be upvoted. In BitTube there is a Upvote button AND a Like button for this. But that is in conflict with my KISS principles. 🤔 
Can't we change Likes by Answers in Upvotes and display a number? A bit like Stackoverflow does?


[22-Jan-20 02:30 AM] Audo#5667
Good suggestion agian, I'll add that to the UX/UI list.

We can't get specific changes made right away though. I will pass on the feedback to the portal devs (external business) and they may or maynot implement some of those changes.

In the future, we can divert from the "main branch" and customize the portal more to our liking. That's when we have more power over how the portal looks and feels.

it will be made public when it launches officially on Feb 3
everything can be read publicly but posting will need signup obviously
it would look similar to <https://community.tribe.so/>
they are the tech provider for the portal

[27-Jan-20 05:07 AM] Audo#5667
I guess you treat the content similarly as if it were on any forum, like bitcointalk forum. You could copy/paste the content and then link to the original source.

cool! thanks i will find it useful.  i have a "news relay" part in my website.

[27-Jan-20 05:24 AM] Audo#5667
nice! The portal got API/widgets too that allows content to be posted to any website and it then shows the discussion in real-time. 

@gcharang do you know if the API/widgets are publicly available to everyone? Could we share it?


[27-Jan-20 05:27 AM] gcharang#6833
API is definitely not public
re: widgets, they offer a questions widget directly. It is very simple to integrate <https://docs.tribe.so/#questions-widget>
but for a widget with posts or a combination of posts/questions like a news feed, we need to contact them with our requirements

for the widgets to work, our portal first needs to go public


[27-Jan-20 05:30 AM] gcharang#6833
ah, there is an alternate way to integrate the widgets using iframes
<https://community.tribe.so/question/5d273b1e3399f46c56a5f6bc>
all of these are possible, after our portal goes public
```
Topic Feed Widget
Group Feed Widget

I think it depends on the content what what topics it relates to?
there are no hard rules right now and common sense rules like
related to Komodo -> Komodo discussion
related to Ecosystem projects -> Komodo ecosystem etc should work?

**Discord Channel Structure Proposal**

The Komodo Community Portal fills many gaps we have tried to fill with Discord.

The problem has been that content gets lost on Discord, so we have given each topic a channel to make it easier to scroll up and find the relevant messages and pinned posts. The result has been an enormous list of channels that overwhelms any newcomer.

Now that we have the portal, we should take another look at the Discord channel structure and try to find ways to make its use more efficient.

**Reasons For Restructuring**

1) We want to encourage the discussion to happen on the portal instead as it provides us with long term benefits.
2) With fewer channels, we would concentrate the conversation and make the Discord feel more active.
3) It is hard to stay on-topic in live chat, so why don't we accept that and use few more general channels instead?

**Share Your Thoughts**

Read the proposal and answer the poll on the Komodo Community Portal.

- Yes, I agree we should reduce the number of channels and rethink the structure
- No, the current Discord structure works, and we should keep it as it is

Share your thoughts here or on the portal thread.

[29-Jan-20 02:22 AM] Audo#5667
Discord channel structure now matches with the proposal. Channels that would be archived according to the current plan are under a category called "To Be Archived".

If there are channels someone thinks we should keep we can discuss it here or leave a comment to the portal discussion.


[29-Jan-20 02:47 AM] Mylo#8306
#dev-marketmaker and #dev-nspv are v.useful unless told otherwise by devs.


[29-Jan-20 02:48 AM] Mylo#8306
Oh man, all cc channels too....does archived mean still readable?


[29-Jan-20 02:50 AM] Mylo#8306
#cc-pegs has a bunch of future tech chat


[29-Jan-20 02:57 AM] Audo#5667
yes, we will keep them in read-only stage. If someone could import all the info to the portal that would be awesome.

If we want to keep more dev channels we can. If those are in active use and there is a fair chance that two different topics would be discussed on #💻┃dev-general simultaniously, then keeping those dev channels makes sense.


[29-Jan-20 02:58 AM] Audo#5667
the proposal was "let's cut everything we can" and then just hear out what we should definitely keep in addition.


[29-Jan-20 03:21 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`Channels that would be archived according to the current plan are under a category called "To Be Archived".`
I cannot imagine a universe in which #⛏┃talk-mining would fall under "archived". Are we just done with having an ecosystem and it's just purely about phone GUIs and trading revenue now?


[29-Jan-20 03:26 AM] Audo#5667
Our thinking is that the mining channel (similar to entrepreneurship) has only new discussions occasionally, and they are of higher value and probably ever-green content. We would like that content to be on the portal, so that we can build like a knowledge base surrounding the topic 'mining'.


[29-Jan-20 03:30 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
Miners are never going to look for some random "portal" (especially one they have to sign up for) for instructions on how to mine each new ecosystem chain (be it new in release or just new to them)


[29-Jan-20 03:32 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Kind of agree with genie tbh


[29-Jan-20 03:32 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
I get that it is of no interest to the handful of people that signed up for the portal, but that doesn't make it so for the rest of the ecosystem


[29-Jan-20 03:33 AM] Audo#5667
All portal content will be public on Monday. Mining related questions can still be asked on our discord even if there is no #mining channel. I doubt anyone goes to #⛏┃talk-mining to search for answers. They would simply ask, and why couldn't they ask about that on #💬┃general ?


[29-Jan-20 03:33 AM] Audo#5667
At the end we will listen to the community. That's why I am asking for feedback.


[29-Jan-20 03:34 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Some people have other channels muted


[29-Jan-20 03:34 AM] Cryptoon#3362
As there is too much non interesting stuff going on


[29-Jan-20 03:34 AM] Audo#5667
ok, that makes sense


[29-Jan-20 03:34 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And stuff like mining I dont mute as usually urgent questions are only asked there


[29-Jan-20 03:34 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`All portal content will be public on Monday.`
Then maybe wait until a month after Monday (and some actual community members have had a voice) before deciding to tell an entire class of community member that they no longer matter in discord?


[29-Jan-20 03:45 AM] Audo#5667
We certainly can give more time to re-consider what to do with all channels that someone feels are important.

I wanted to change the structure already so it is more evident what will change, and that we would get some discussion going on (like we did).

When it comes to the structure we certainly will listen to the community. That is why we have channels in the first place. The very reason for this reorg plan is all the complaints about too many discord channels. We are simply trying to listen to everyone and improve. So let's calmn down :)

Current channels that have been mentioned as important
 - #dev-marketmaker 
 - #dev-nspv 
 - #cc-pegs 
 - #⛏┃talk-mining


[29-Jan-20 03:48 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`The very reason for this reorg plan is all the complaints about too many discord channels. `
I'm one of the 1st people in line to make that complaint.
However, the answer is to do away with channels that serve the same function/topic, not just delete things that people that were likely never active in the topic think shouldn't be a topic.


[29-Jan-20 03:50 AM] Audo#5667
We haven't deleted anything and all changes are easy to revert.

This is a good discussion. I am going for dinner now, I'll be back later. Keep the feedback coming

my vote goes against cats & unicorns but I'm not the one making the final decision, so lets see what the rest of our community thinks.

@Hember | $ARRR you can go to your profile and under "replies" find the one you're looking for and use the "posted recently" link, it'll look like:

I got feedback about some of the active cc-dev channels being in the "archived" category.

Perhaps the right solution is to keep the currently active channels under the "Komodo Project" and the others under an "archived" category. Whatever module/technology is under active development can be moved up to the 'Komodo Project' category, and visa versa.

I hope this would be a middle of the road approach that has the good sides of both worlds:
 - we keep the dev channels that help us to develop & test new technologies
 - we mark the (currently) inactive channels as 'archived' not to overwhelm the new users about where our current focus is and what all the different names mean.

Let me know what you think of this.


[19-Feb-20 04:29 AM] Audo#5667

I moved these up to the 'Komodo Project' category
 - #cc-pegs 
 - #cc-channels 
 - #dev-subatomic


[19-Feb-20 04:30 AM] Farl#9964
Seems like a logical move


[19-Feb-20 04:30 AM] Oszy#5734
we could have Active Development and Finished / In Progess maybe?

Perhaps an "inactive" category as well as "archived" for those that aren't currently active but also not "dead"?


[19-Feb-20 04:35 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
"archived" reads like "this is dead, but we're saving the conversations for posterity"

i dont understand the OCD need to reduce channels


[19-Feb-20 04:36 AM] Audo#5667
yeah, we have to find better terminology


[19-Feb-20 04:36 AM] jl777c#5810
why not have a "folder" where the channels can be all made to look like one thing, if you dont want to scare people with the number of things that are going on


[19-Feb-20 04:37 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont mind having a single firehose channel where all topics are discussed, but i have heard most people cant handle having multiple things happening in a serial fashion, let along dozens of different things. so i accept to have more channels, but now we are having to reduce the number of channels to being less than the number of different topics that are being discussed


[19-Feb-20 04:38 AM] jl777c#5810
why?


[19-Feb-20 04:38 AM] jl777c#5810
just minimize all the CC channels and it becomes one category, it takes up one slot and isnt scary.


[19-Feb-20 04:38 AM] jl777c#5810
of course, its ok to have two dozen language channels


[19-Feb-20 04:38 AM] jl777c#5810
but if they are tech channels it will scare the newbs


[19-Feb-20 04:40 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
has to agree with James on dev channels 🤔


[19-Feb-20 04:40 AM] Audo#5667
most of the channels removed were non-dev related. Currently the dev channels are as they were but only under "archived" labels.

The language channels are not visible to the normal users, only to us admins who see all the channels.

We can keep the dev channels in any way you devs prefer. We can go back to the old way of listing all cc-channels in one category and all dev channels in another category.


[19-Feb-20 04:41 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
the main reason I offered the idea of a "middle" classification is that the reorg of channels seems to be by the less tech-involved (for lack of a better term)
still not sure who decided to "archive" #marmara literally the day after they started to get somewhere solid 😕

[19-Feb-20 04:42 AM] jl777c#5810
why the need to actively reduce channels to below the number of independent topics?

_**My view on the situation on #📈┃talk-trading**_

As far as I can remember, we have always had a very loose moderation policy. Very rarely have we ever banned anyone. If we have, it's been because of abusive behavior and bad language. We have never banned anyone (to my knowledge) who has just complained, even if they have been trolling on purpose and brought nothing but negativity.

I agree that non-productive discussion/criticism serves no real purpose. It is little like being half-drunk and watching football on TV while continuously complaining about the game. If someone truly cares about the project (or game), he will become active and try to make things better instead of complaining about it.

Productive criticism is always welcome, and of course, we went to improve continuously. We do our best, and if there are good ideas on how we could improve, please let us know.

My recommendation is that we should not make too quick decisions. We don't want to be going back & forth with the policy or second-guessing the decisions. My recommendation is to steer our ship slowly and then maintain the course.

**_About our moderation policy_ **

We are an open-source project, and we have to keep things as open and transparent as possible. There is a line there somewhere, though. It's not up to the Komodo team or community moderators to decide where that line is. Our moderation policy is a reflection of our culture and the input we receive.

Here is the bottom line:

1) Community Moderators enforce our community guidelines & moderation policy
2) **Community influences the guidelines & moderation policy**
3) Moderator team reviews and implements changes.

Current banning policy: we ban scammers and people who can't behave (situation that happened on #📈┃talk-trading does not apply).

If our community feels we are too loose on the moderation policy, then we need to have some opinions and discussion about it. We are not going to change the policy ad hoc. 

The best place to leave feedback and discuss moderation policy is this channel.

Just a suggestion. Maybe create a health channel for health related topics including corona virus. As it mimics real life, corona virus chat is spreading into other channels. Soon, I expect it to exponentially take over all channels. We need to be able to quarantine corona talk to its own channel before it's too late. 😷

@Audo Am I talking to Komodo's marketing manager (on the website it says that's Audo Kowitz)? We had quite a discussion today on telegram why it is that a lot of crypto influencers, such as Julian Hosp, Ivan On Tech, der Blocktrainer, and today even Vitalik Buterin talk about different aspects of DEXes, all claiming that it's not existing yet, or limited in supported chains etc., thus not knowing anything about Komodo's AtomicDEX. Two hours ago there has even been published a cointelegraph article about Vitalik's recent post, where he requests to put efforts into developing such a highly-desired cross chain DEX. In the chat, we all strongly felt that there's something seriously wrong with komodo's marketing and rising of industry-wide awareness. We, the users, kindly ask the Komodo team to increase resources on marketing, or re-think existing approaches and measures, because reading posts and articles like these show us, that so far we only developed within our closed little system, not seen and known of by the world.

I know that we are still in Beta with atomicDEX, however, that's still no reason why the awareness and knowing about what's being developed is lacking on a wide scale due to lack of marketing. It's like someone trying to re-invent the wheel without knowing that someone else has almost completed the building of the first wheel. It's an unnecessary effort only due to lack of awareness about what's already being built.

Hey @t_dan ,

Nowadays we are working with a PR agency who has been getting us a lof of media coverage. AtomicDEX and our progress has been covered multiple times.

We have had a policy in place for some time now to not attend blockchain conferences as those take a lot of time and money.

AtomicDEX is a major focus for us in 2020 both from marketing and from development perspective. There will be markeitng activities surrounding AtomiDEX once we go to the 'release candidate' stage. Currently our team is doing backend optimizations and preparing for Desktop alpha. Our marketing team is working on to build a new atomicdex.io website.

Our response to the Vitalik tweet was noticed by him and there's now an effort to walk him through what we have. I don't have the details about that.

No one of us have had Vitalki phone number, and it's not easy to reach out to the biggest influencers when there is so much noise in the market. We have all information publicly available and well documented nowadays. 

My personal opinion is that eventually the tech cannot be ignored, and it will get noticed. From marketing perspective we are focusing on the fundamentals: write documentation, publish regular updates/newsletters/articles, work with PR agency, focus on community building. We are not spending money on advertisements nor conferences, nor do we have money for a giant ambassador program or other marketing packages that are constantly advertised to us.

I believe with 'marketing' people often mean media mentions. Here are few recent media mentions:

- https://magazine.cointelegraph.com/2020/03/12/journeys-in-blockchain-kadan-stadelmann/
- https://bravenewcoin.com/insights/podcasts/atomic-dex-how-the-komodo-decentralized-exchange-enables-atomic-swaps
- https://decrypt.co/12783/komodo-makes-big-upgrade-to-its-atomic-swap-technology

With 'marketing' people might also refer to business development. This year we have put more budged to business development and we for the first time we have a small team and a concious effort on that front.

Incase you guys wonder what has the marketing team been working on then, here are few things we have done in 2019/2020
 - New messaging, rebrand (Smart Chains / Antara Framework) www.komodoplatform.com
 - First atomicdex.io website version (update coming, as mentioned)
 - new community portal community.komodoplatform.com
 - a lot of documentation was created, with much help from the dev & support team of course: developers.komodoplatform.com
 - continous coverage through weekly/monthly updates and blog posts.
 - An ongoing SEO campaign to drive traffic to our website: https://komodoplatform.com/category/blockchain-fundamentals/

If there is something specific you guys would like us to do drop a hint/idea. If there is a button we could press for more marketing, we would. I don't think there are shortcuts though, so for better marketing we have to keep steadily walking the rocky path and focus on fundamentals. We might not be perfect, but we do constantly work and get better at what we do.

I also see a great deal of things being done with limited resources.
PR, advertising, marketing and business dev are coming together and will likely peak at the same time as the tech, building a very strong platform.

@Audo Thank you for addressing our concerns and taking them seriously. I don't know how other companies do their marketing, but the most common that I am aware of, and which could also be considered by Komodo:
- Youtube advertisment videos that are shown ahead other videos
- Twitter advertisments
In other words, why do I see "eToro" ad videos ahead of almost each crypto-related video and not a Komodo advertisment video? Why do I see  Apple ads in my Twitter account instead of Komodo ads? I'm sure there are other prominent channels. Just some food for thought.


[26-Mar-20 09:23 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @t_dan,
It's really nice to have your feedback and that from everyone else.
I'll pass along what I've seen when the issue of this sort of advertising has been discussed before.
Basically comes down to effective use of limited resources. 
There isn't much bang-for-the-buck for a project like Komodo to advertize in such ways.

To produce longer term growth to build on, a more b2b approach seems to make sense.  As that continues to grow, the front-end side (the b2b clients) will also be promoting Komodo through the use of their products and services.

[07-Aug-20 07:08 AM] ohweoh#0581
I just saw a ETC tweet from Komodo. Just wondering, how much would it cost for Komodo to secure their network yearly, is it something like 5000 staked kmd ? And has Komodo discussed doing promotional dpow protection for chains? Might be good for community engagement and marketing?


[07-Aug-20 07:20 AM] Audo#5667
I don't quite remember the exact pricing, and for third party projects its a bit more complicated as it will require custom work from our side. It's not very expensive though, if you compare the price to how much inflation high mining rewards generate. We are talking about 5000 - 10,000 USD range per year, depending on situation.

For latest info and the details the projects would need to reach out to our business devs

Since ETC 51% attack. What is the difficulty to add dPow to ETC code? Is it possible to just do it ourselves and then use this to generate press and hopefully greater dpow acceptance


[09-Aug-20 07:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I think the first challenge is to have a ETC community consensus, on agreement to add dPoW service to the chain.
the technical challenge would be someone from the devs side taking the charge to implement dPoW to ETC consensus. I don't know this part's details so can't comment how much level of work it might be.


[09-Aug-20 07:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
KMD devs will be able to assist, but the dPoW implementation has to be done by ETC devs to my understanding.


[09-Aug-20 07:43 AM] gcharang#6833
>  can't comment how much level of work it might be
I can say that it will be completely new work, as no other ETH fork has dPoW yet


[09-Aug-20 07:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
agree


[09-Aug-20 07:44 AM] gcharang#6833
for example, implementing dPoW to a btc fork (utxo chain) is easier these days because it has been done many times already


[09-Aug-20 07:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
true


[09-Aug-20 08:28 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
>  Is it possible to just do it ourselves and...
As I understand it needs a mandatory update on the ETC nodes. Of course a 'external' dev can put that in technically, but it would mean the support of the ETC community is needed to implement that update, possibly a forking of ETC can happen at that point if the ETC community cannot reach consensus.


[09-Aug-20 08:56 AM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
Let me clarify my statement. Instead of asking permission, and gaining ETC dev support for such a thing, we just do it. Think of it as a marketing exercise, it's an excuse to make some noise and get everyone to look at us. A friendly boast, "see, we provide  insurance against 51% attack". Let them publicly say, no we don't want to secure our chain. We just do it, to show them up.


[09-Aug-20 09:03 AM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
It would be a more aggressive approach to marketing dPow. Kinda like friendly picking a fight

[09-Aug-20 09:11 AM] ejuliano#8606
if you mean forking etc and doing the work to implement dpow to this forked chain, call it ETK (ethereum komodo) or whatever, i think that's a fun guerrilla marketing tactic, plus even better it's a research and development effort for komodo to learn how to do it

{Reactions}
🤔 

[09-Aug-20 09:37 AM] Audo#5667
@༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻ I think that's a valid approach to consider. Makes sense on paper: we would offer them a full solution ready to be rolled out. They would have to take a serious look at it, and it would put more pressure.

However, we cannot enable dPoW without their consent and cooperation. Also,  the issue with this route is that we would have to tie dev resources into it, and then the ETC community might still turn-down the offer or ignore it.

The smartest move for us is to keep the focus on AtomicDEX and roll-out the release candidate & stress test on time.

Agree to last one with @Audo .  For dPOW best marketing is just tweeting of it everytime some chain is 51% attacked. And telling how many days it has been protecting chains that adopted it. Maybe own twitter channel for dPOW to publish statistics of it success?

Has dPow been accredited by any organizations or institutions? Someone professional that we can point to that recognizes the solution as legit.


[09-Aug-20 12:12 PM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
It would be easier to promote dPow if say someone like Gavin Andresen vetted it. Reason being, say we approach an insurance company or coinbase to work dpow into a product offering, I'd imagine the first thing they would say is, can you prove it works, and can a respected third party prove it works.

U.S. government seems to be taking an attitude of actively embracing bitcoin and crypto as it cannot stop it. 
what stand does Komodo intend to take on the positions of these governments? 

It doesn't look good against government.

concerns that bitcoin and crypto could be used by criminal organizations are likely to be seen as reasons why bitcoins are difficult to mainstream. the reality, however, is developing in the opposite direction. first goal not only for the U.S. but also for governments around the world regarding bitcoin is to destroy bitcoin and its technology. however, in the course of the study, we find that this goal is virtually impossible. government has no choice but to readjust its policy goals in line with what it can do. It is only a matter of time before realizing that bold engagement policy is the only measure to manage much within the system.

In fact, the more banks secure customers' bitcoins, the more the government can identify bitcoins owners. 
It can also identify the ownership status of people who are not left to the bank because bitcoin moves in the network of wallets. 
real owner of wallet, which was traded with a known wallet, can be tracked if the investigative authorities have a will.

U.S. government signaled that banks should take lead in crypto rather than Facebook. 
this measure suggests that other governments' concerns are in fact concluded. 
It also reminds us that there is not much time left.

Komodo is already a transparent chain, Elliptic and other software can do tracking if they want.  We dont have an issue working with governments, however we will not allow governments to dictate development.

Unlike existing financial assets, bitcoin and crypto do not require financial networks when they are transferred and stored. In other words, two people on the other side of the globe can remit money as if they were exchanging cash directly without relying on the security system of the government's reach. It is an innovative technology that is likely to be used in the dark unless institutional rights are held.

komodo, leader in atomic swap, are both very innovative and destructive, so komodo seem very likely to be used in the dark. 

what strategy does komodo have to be incorporated into the social system and nurtured?

or, do you have a strategy to continue to circumvent government regulations without being included in the system?


[09-Aug-20 10:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
In order to become mass adoption and popularization, komodo must be incorporated into a social system and function in accordance with legal procedures without social problems. 

curious about Komodo team's strategy in terms of social, not technical.

as a Komodo team with innovative and destructive technology, 
I think there will be a lot of conflict, interference, and oppression with existing system.

head-to-head competition with government and existing system is a very reckless strategy. 

hope to komodo take a realistic and feasible strategy.

Alot of that will be revealed over this last quarter, a good analogy to what we are working towards business wise can be found in Wordpress. https://torquemag.io/2013/01/wpf-automattic/ atomic swaps and compliance are not mutually exclusive.  People who want a version of it that allows compliance are welcome to do so.   According to https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/240.3b-16 ,  in the Exchange Act,  definition of an exchange is 1) Brings together the orders for securities of multiple buyers and sellers; and

(2) Uses established, non-discretionary methods (whether by providing a trading facility or by setting rules) under which such orders interact with each other, and the buyers and sellers entering such orders agree to the terms of a trade.      Point 1 is not applicable to Komodo as each person using it compiles their own orderbooks, we dont do any matching. ( The operative word "and" )

Thank you for sincere reply and apologize for my past severe criticism.

imagination that they will be satisfied with the passive service of waiting for bitcoin to be brought in and then storing it in the safe for a certain amount of storage fee is weak. banks employing experts will try to actively offer investment portfolios of crypto-currency to older and wealthy customers, mostly. 

since it involves investment advice that analyzes related news based on expertise, storage fees will also be subject to changes depending on earnings. banks can actively develop and sell products that contain various crypto-currency.

of course, currency regulator drew the line that customers' crypto assets should be managed individually. customers' assets must be kept in kind because they cannot be combined and operated. 
In other words, it is not possible to do credit work with a customer's crypto. 

however, once the banking sector secures large amounts of crypto assets, lobbying to expand its business will be inevitable.

how difiult/easy is it for Ethereum ERC20-based projects to transfer their existing work onto KMD/Antara chains?  What sort of disruption might that entail for currently functioning applications that already serve customers?  Could it be done in parallel while they continue to run their current operation as-is until the Antara chain is ready to go?


[10-Aug-20 09:20 PM] Mylo#8306
smart contracts are synchronous (stuff can happen between smart contracts more easily), account based, have 10 decimal figures, have different programming primitives, runs on top of blockchain.
Consensus logic is asynchronous (requires a confirmation), is utxo based, has 8 decimal places,  uses c++ (but there is python and rust implementations brewing), is part of blockchain.

the same stuff can pretty much be engineered.  slighly different mindset required.
if the utxo model is familiar, then it is much easier to grasp.
EIPs help eth standardize on behaviour.

```getting exchanges to do anything is not easy at all. that is why dpowconfs is designed to require no changes for exchanges running the standard daemon
however many exchanges run custom daemons, with custom security things... so it isnt as simple as it seems and we go back again to where it is hard to get exchanges to do anything custom
```
Can anyone elaborate on this jl777 quote? What kind of custom things are exchanges doing to kmd daemon? And what are these custom security things? And how do these changes effect dPow?


[20-Aug-20 09:53 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'd assume the exchange developers who are serious about their security, make their own APIs for even the blockchain networks they use on their exchanges. The reason could be multiple, ranging from security to more efficiency on managing the wallets, private keys, funds etc. Example can be like just utilising the blockchain database and parsing the direct TCP/UDP/IP network connections with peers where the network messages are received and sent. And using their own custom solution in such ways means such custom programming will at one hand give them less reliance on the wallets/coins own performance and security aspects, and also allows them to isolate their own cryptocurrency management system. Possibly allowing easier integration once they add a protocol support to such custom coins daemon or blockchain management system. Pretty sure it would be very proprietary system if any big exchanges would have built in last decade, because blockchains as general and their default daemons are very slow performing on their own, and there are various other ways to enhance the performance.


[20-Aug-20 09:54 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
If that is the case, that would mean such exchange would not even be using the default transactions confirmations API provided by the daemon, but only using the daemon to connect to their native blockchain


[20-Aug-20 09:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and that could be the possible reason of unable to use default confirmations provided by the daemon's API, leading to unable to use dPoW confirmations


[20-Aug-20 09:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Note that I'm just assuming this scenario, but it is very much a likely scenario for centralised exchanges who are big and want an efficient blockchains management system of their own.


[20-Aug-20 09:56 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
jl777's `iguana` code was such example, which allowed to connect to multiple different network of blockchains and gave a common API set to create different applications around it.


[20-Aug-20 09:57 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
using `iguana` we didn't even need to download the existing wallet/daemon software of for example Bitcoin, Litecoin, and various other supported wallets.


[20-Aug-20 09:57 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
`iguana` could directly connect to these networks provided some params and some seed IPs to connect to the network, and the rest was just managed by the `iguana`


[20-Aug-20 09:59 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if jl777 being a single developer could have made such an efficient common blockchain management daemon as early as 2014-2016, imagine what multiple core level developers could develop for centralised exchanges with huge funding to back the development and make a solid blockchain management system for a centralised service like cryptocurrency exchange.


[20-Aug-20 09:59 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻ hope this gives some idea of why could be the possible reason of not using `dpowconfs` by exchanges.

Hey guys maybe someone can help me understand.. I am trying to research the difference between Komodo, Cosmos and Polkadot. 
Cosmos sends Blockchain token transfers ( sending value) cross chain. Polkadot does Both... 
Komodo does both.. Better! (Correct?) KMD DEX etc..
The other two are single chain? More centralized?
KMD allows for your own chain (or as many as you want). What am I missing? How do these blockchains have an upper hand on KMD? or do they? 

Also, will KMD get involved in Defi?

I have been telling others about KMD for over 3 years but all the noobs see is what all these youtube kids are talking about and not the true tech. Lots of advertising pumping the value.
I really don't like the projects who spend millions on advertising and pump the price. I love the fact that KMD just keeps building a better project but it would be nice to have a few short youtube videos explaining these things/differences. 
Thanks for any help. Just doing my best teaching others about projects I love and believe will be here in the long run.

Polkadot: The first real difference I noticed on the website is that Polkadot uses a so called Relay Chain to connect all the chains together, whereas PBaas connects all the chains to the main network. This Relay chain provides the interchain security, where Verus has all the security features built in.  Polkadot uses Bridges to allow inerchain communication, which have there own security built in in do not rely on the Relay Chain. They use a host of diffenerent roles like Validators, collectors and nominators to make the chains interoperable

Cosmos: they enable you to compose your own blockchain with a mix of prebuilt and self built modules. It will take programmers with descent knowledge hours to do so. Cosmos uses a seperate chain called the Hub for inter-blockchain communication, which acts as a ledger for all Cosmos subchains. The Hub also tracks the tokens held by private entities and the subchains (called zones).
As far as I see all Cosmos chains can freely use the same PoS security, but don't receive automatic validation of that security from the main chain, but they have the option to do so. Cosmos uses a limited set of validators that reach consensus for transactions

Thanks Oink, maybe its because I understand KMD a little better but they both seem more complicated and not as secure. I will read your response a few more times to help it sink in my little brain! ahha thanks again!

@LeshAft9  AtomicDEX is the name of the DEX, AtomicDefi is the name AtomicDEX was going to change to (to show that it is more than a DEX) but the community did not like it so they changed it back and will see what the community wants to do. KMD is the main pair on AtomicDEX and created by the KMD team.

grayscale, which is entrusted with investment in cryptocurrency by institutions, is continuing its explosive growth. not long ago, MicroStrategy, the world's largest corporate information provider and NASDAQ-listed company, said it bought 250 million dollars worth of bitcoins, totaling 21,454 bitcoin. the official reason for investing in bitcoin is that the risk of holding company assets in cash is too high because of inflation.

there is one more factor to pay attention to other than the growth of the ecosystem, inflation and institutional investment. It is the escape of assets outside the chinese border. the possibility has already emerged since the Hong Kong crisis last year. since then, the pace of development of china's decoupling led by the U.S. has been accelerating, drawing more attention. the slush funds of chinese communist party leaders, which have already been hidden in swiss banks, have become the center of controversy. they say that a huge amount of money worth more than 1 trillion won per person has been hidden in swiss banks. swiss banks are likely to disclose their list. In other words, Hong Kong, the U.S., and switzerland, the three preferred asset havens of china's rich, are not expected to be intact. therefore, chances are high that china's rich people will consider securing bitcoins and burying them for a long time. If you keep the mined coins in the form of paper wallets unless you create a deal, you won't be caught, nor will it take you to cross the border.


[31-Aug-20 04:45 AM] Deleted User#0000
chainalysis, a blockchain analysis company, already estimated that about $50 billion (about 59 trillion won) worth of funds have been withdrawn from china over the past year. although Tether, which is more linked to dollars and prices than bitcoin, is mainly used, the fact that Tether's management is currently being indicted by the U.S. New York prosecutors is an important variable. this is because investment in Tether is likely to be identified by U.S. financial authorities. after all, it is highly likely that bitcoin will be the final choice of chinese rich people.

It has been eight years since those who want to be institutionalized like the winkleboss brothers began to focus on bitcoin. bitcoin, as they thought, began to encounter institutional rights. perhaps the real reason for bitcoin's existence is the desire of global citizens and individuals to secure a link to the global system.

bitcoin opposes manipulation because it begins with a fundamental pessimism about humanism. on the other hand, ethereum itself is an attempt to "manipulate" the world with good will.

The problem is that ethereum can be replaced by a nation, the best monster invented by mankind for manipulation, because of its very manipulative worldview.

In fact, ethereum, which is progressive to eat a bitcoin that opposes manipulation, and controlled governments are attacking from all sides, and the day when the ethereum blockchain camp, which seems completely alien, and the governments, are united is likely to come soon.

I posted in general, but maybe this is better place: I am a holder going all the way back to BTCD, and it has been a long ride for me here, but my sack of KMD will be out in a month unless the price miraculously moons soon. I’ve lurked around here and always held as long as possible. My biggest regret is not selling at $10, so foolish, I could have been so rich. I’ve been able to do a lot with my investment and I’m extremely grateful to the team and jl777, but I am disappointed at the recent fate at least price wise we are in. My only question is if assets like REVS and JUMBLR have any value and how to sell if I choose to.


[15-Sep-20 12:37 PM] tolken#2655
@cah5896  REVs should be tradeable on AtomicDefi, but for some reason they haven't added it as a coin in the GUI apps.  REVs certainly has value as it derives profits from multiple streams - small dividends still, but that's more than many can claim. JUMBLR is rumored to possibly be repurposed down the line.  Sorry to hear KMD hasn't met your expectations, hopefully the price pumps before you dump. Good luck.

sadly, corona virus has pushed the transition to a cashless society. All the money will be converted into digital form in the future. 
In the process, only criminals, tax evaders and extreme privacy advocates will remain in the cash process.


[10-Oct-20 05:32 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
That may be true in certain regions in the world. Not the entire world has the infrastructure to facilitate electronic cash. People in those regions have no choice to pay cash (electronic payment devices in my micro-region have only been introduced last year). By your definition, people in those regions are criminals, tax evaders or extreme privacy advocates.

if you want to buy anything from another individual (not a business) in person, cash is still king. Card and paypal transactions can be reversed, leaving the seller with nothing. It's a common scam.

Hey quick question - I noticed the peg module which allows developers to create a pegged stablecoin through your platform. Is there plans or a method to create a non-pegged stablecoin i.e. non-collateralized


[15-Oct-20 08:26 PM] gcharang#6833
@DigitalDan
> a pegged stablecoin 
a pegged coin just means that its value should always be equal to a predefined external asset. to make the design resilient, our design includes a collateral

> non-pegged stablecoin i.e. non-collateralized
they are not the same. non-pegged just means the coins value isn't equal to any external asset, just like most cryptos

how do you think a non-collateralised stable coin can be trustworthy? do you know of any designs?


[15-Oct-20 08:29 PM] DigitalDan#5742
@gcharang I think I am tracking what you're saying. non-pegged stablecoin is only as trusted as the people or organization who is putting it out i.e. the reason the USD which is not pegged to anything other than our government works... Right? Idk if you're free right now but maybe a quick voice chat in the hangouts room would clear up my confusion


[15-Oct-20 08:30 PM] DigitalDan#5742
I know what you're saying and agree with you, maybe I am delirious thinking a non-collateralized could be executed


[15-Oct-20 08:33 PM] gcharang#6833
sorry, not available for a call right now.
>  non-pegged stablecoin is only as trusted as the people or organization who is putting it out
thats my thought as well
> the reason the USD which is not pegged to anything other than our government works... 
 here too, there is collateral. just not monetary. it is reputation, power in the physical world :D, history etc


[15-Oct-20 08:35 PM] DigitalDan#5742
No worries - right but in that example it isn't pegged to an a physical asset but rather ideologies ... which can be created through a product. I am asking my question from a basis of a side project I am developing a product - trying to determine the correct tech stack for my team and I to dive into

[15-Oct-20 11:14 PM] Mylo#8306
sounds like you would need an instrument to bind the physical object to some value of COIN.  Then using these COINS as collateral to produce the stablecoin.   The COIN would need to have some price attached to it.   just thoughts.

Thanks for update. do you have a timeline for version 2 and details of what will be in it?


[20-Oct-20 10:33 PM] gcharang#6833
version 2 of pegs will be similar in architecture to pegs v1, but will update the internals so that it is more difficult to disrupt the expected functionality of the module. @Mihailo will be able to tell us its expected timeline


[21-Oct-20 01:20 AM] Mihailo#5902
Pegs module is dependent on tokens, oracles and gateways. When those are complete in V2 then pegs will get its turn. Tokens and oracles are already done in v2, gateways are in process...

I would like to suggest a position be filled to further the Marketing team. Someone needs to be tasked with defining contests, rewards and other giveaways completely, so that the rules are determined beforehand, all rewards are defined and put onto Social Media with confidence and end users don;t have to question how things work.

Please share all feedback regarding the past bounty context and let us know exactly what to change. We need to plan new contests for the upcoming stress tests.

Let's make the next context a perfect one. Anyone who wants to get involved can. Maybe we make a call to brainstorm ideas and go over the plan.

@daemonfox Love the energy and enthusiasm, looking forward to the collab.  Like what @Audo said we're planning out events to come for the stress test and other engagement activities, and looking forward to responses to his opening question.   

Halloween was definitely a 'test the waters' event for us, with the new marketing team setup we have, and needing to collect some sentiments + metrics for our communities current level of participation.

I’m worried about Komodo, have been with the project since ICO. The market isn’t rational and overvalues eth ecosystem coins over independent blockchains. Competition too has increased and I’m a bit worried about Komodo funding (longevity). 
People are buying food coins and scams. That capital should be used for good true to crypto projects. Perhaps atomicdex holders should be diluted and an ico should be made. Perhaps a  new system/project using atomicdex should form. A polkadot competitor for example.
Idk what to say anymore. People didn’t understand Komodo tech. It wasn’t adopted for some strange reason. Komodo costs are pretty high. I fear for the future of the project I loved.
Unlike cfb, doge, ltc, etc. Komodo has kept innovating. It truly a sad sight when real projects fair worse than “scams”.
Is Komodo still well funded? Am I worrying for no reason?

You said what I was thinking! I have been buying KMD every dip and have Loved KMD for years now. I Shill it all over youtube because I believe the tech is so much better than most other top coins out there. People buy "hype" as they should to make money but do people see how great KMD is? I don't think so. I search every day for a new YouTube video on Komodo but rarely do I ever find one, if any. I can find thousands on ETH, EOS, ZIL, Link, cosmos, Dot  and yet I still think KMD is far better. Someone explain to me why Doge coin is top 50 and KMD is 150? I know Komodo is funded and they are not going to stop innovating but I feel like it need some mention and respect soon or I am goin to start thinking I am nuts.

Hello. I just installed the desktop version of the atomic dex. Works really well. I just saw something that might be a bug.
1) I'm getting multiple notifications for the same transactions. 
2)I've also sent it only once from my phone wallet. But in the notifications it says I've both sent and reviewed.
3) in the notifications, the information button doesn't really do anything. It just closes out the notifications.
