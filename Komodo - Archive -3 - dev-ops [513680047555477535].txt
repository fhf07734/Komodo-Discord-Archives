@patchkez @Mylo @Deleted User 

I'm trying to answer the following questions and open to your input:
- Do we want to use a publicly accessible trello board for managing the tasks related to containerisation: https://trello.com/b/lrL1g3Es
_I'm open to using git project if we have majority suggesting to go with it.
- Which repo would we like to focus on for this work?
- How can we be transparent about the number of hours each of us has each weeks to work on different tasks
- I'm trying to think about the higher level vision of what we want to achieve as part of this exercise. Eg. We want to be able to quickly launch semi baked containers on both local machines for testing and in production on schedulers like k8 or openshift.
- Then, it would be worthwhile to think about what strategy we want to undertake. Eg. Initially, we may just look at the work that @Deleted User and @patchkez did to containerise things and see what's remaining if we were to put that work to use in a new test environment. And we can define tasks from there.

Also, I'm very open to suggestions and changes that can actually help us stay motivated, consistent and get *actual results* - not just for ourselves but for any new person who comes alone for the ride.

Why do we need containerisation:

- On komodoplatform, we run a whole range of chains which get compiled, configured and deployed differently. Each of these may have different dependencies and it gets harder to test things *in isoltation* when we deploy all of these on a single server. We  would like to handle this problem through containerisation where self container docker images can be used to launch containers which work exactly the same irrespective of underlying operating system (_and it's version_).
- Compilation takes a while and occasionally we see 3rd party packages being missed. We would like to keep dockerhub images which have compiled version that can just be used without any fuss.
- Local testing on your laptops gets easier because you can just work with a container, make changes and then get it deployed onto your production environment.

Yes, that's what - but let's just start with trello and we'll see how things go.

>all coins which are run on NN are containerized. But improvement is needed here. This is up-to-date repo and I run this on my NN https://github.com/patchkez/kmdplatform

Great! We can always improve and even refactor things if needed. Great to have a really good, tested starting point though - thanks to you.

That's cool. We'll learn from it and refactor things to make it better.

Absolutely, let's just start populating a few cards. I'm just gonna pop a card on the board so that you can put your plan in there and we can then look at either adding "docs" directory in your git repo later.

as i said, basically you need to take a tar image of your working MyLinuxOS 1.1 and then import -> that creates a base image

For others (_look at this channel_), I will try to capture some of the requirements / concerns / improvements being mentioned here at least a few times in a week.
It would be great if those raising them can just draft those as issues - we can then take things from there.
Please do note that at the moment, we're really trying to focus on containerisation from Notary Node perspective but in the process, we'll be either listing or creating artefacts that can be used by others for testing or launching these komodoplatform (and thirdparty) resources quickly.

At the moment, we're working from @patchkez 's repository so submitting an issue request there will be helpful.
Also, we're tracking our work through and currently there's nothing on there but in the next week or so, we'll have more cards that will reflect our direction: https://trello.com/b/lrL1g3Es/containerisation

There won't even be git in there. The only benefit from alpine afaik is that it is very light weight. For KMD purposes ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04 as a base will be better I think


[13-Dec-18 05:38 PM] Mylo#8306
Ok going back to Ubuntu thx


[13-Dec-18 05:40 PM] Mylo#8306
Still handy for a nodejs app I think.  The alpine packaging seems pretty straight forward however, once the base Ubuntu layer is on user machine, the d/l and storage is already a ‚Äúsunk cost‚Äù

I had komodo building on Arch a few versions ago, but now it just errors out like crazy again. it seems to be mostly newer GCC that complains more than older versions.


[13-Dec-18 05:49 PM] Deleted User#0000
Best to stick with whatever the devs are using, so I just use 16.04 server VM that has all deps, and copy it. only a 10GB image, and you can copy it anywhere.


[13-Dec-18 05:51 PM] Mylo#8306
Yes agree.   The benefits are lost with any time lost to things that have been solved or are not a problem elsewhere.

yes, that is the nearest we are to a official repo


[14-Jan-19 05:13 AM] siu#3920

im playing around with docker :p


[15-Jan-19 07:13 PM] Mylo#8306
There is a dockerfile in kmd src also I have a cpl different but the most optimised is a 250MB image at https://hub.docker.com/u/imylomylo using the releases binary


[15-Jan-19 07:15 PM] Mylo#8306
This is the best one imo for size.  I‚Äôll be using it for all documentation in devportal.  Will post recipe online, it will need one further optimization for official release with the binary release of komodod/Komodo-cli from the release catalogue to provide a json file of the sha256 of those files so someone can be sure when they build their own from binary, rather than src.

ok,  "initialize" with a rw volume, then after that re-use that same volume ro.   annoying but it's like that for a reason!!

i'm building kmd like i used to, for a time i used the binaries only and mounted a docker volume ro, which was really lean.  but building it, i guess i just have to mount an empty volume on first build rw.

I'm trying to build on alpine.  Looks like zcash made some changes to the source a couple of years ago to make it possible.  With komodo I'm getting an issue with librustzcash.  cargo cannot be found and there is no option to build without-rust as there was in zcash.
Has anyone managed to build in alpine?


[16-Apr-19 01:52 AM] Mylo#8306
no i gave up with alpine.  not much advantage compared to ubuntu


[17-Apr-19 06:21 PM] Greer#0666
Its tiny in comparison so much quicker to fire up an image from dockerhub, but alas, gave up too.  Zcash got it working.

I was searching for proper docker images to run komodo


[08-May-19 10:35 AM] Bongistan#2965
and to be honest I was quite disappointed.


[08-May-19 10:35 AM] Bongistan#2965
most of the docker images for komodo were not working.


[08-May-19 10:35 AM] Bongistan#2965
so I did put something together.


[08-May-19 10:35 AM] Bongistan#2965

However I am trying to run multiple of this images


[08-May-19 10:47 AM] Bongistan#2965
because I think I need to run two komodod to launch my own chain.


[08-May-19 10:49 AM] Bongistan#2965
I actually download the zcash params when I build the docker image.


[08-May-19 10:49 AM] Bongistan#2965
yes it does


[08-May-19 10:50 AM] Bongistan#2965
that is a good optimization.

you can use -testnode=1 so you can test params and start chains with 1 node only. üòÉ

might only be in jl777 branch though

the jl777 branch is the dev branch


[08-May-19 10:52 AM] Bongistan#2965
right?


[08-May-19 10:52 AM] Bongistan#2965
it is a little confusing as normally I would look for a dev tag


[08-May-19 10:53 AM] Bongistan#2965
but as I understand it jl777 is dev repo,


[08-May-19 10:53 AM] Bongistan#2965
and then komodo has the release repo


[08-May-19 10:53 AM] Bongistan#2965

I want to track ownership of multiple unique items.

[10-Feb-21 05:55 AM] cipi#4502
the geo stuff is of course not reliable, never was... it shows the location of the provider that reserved the IP address
```
address:        Telenet Operaties N.V.
address:        Liersesteenweg 4
address:        B-2800 Mechelen
address:        Belgium
```
you could try a `traceroute` and guess the location from the other IPs

I know whose ip adress it is, just got to prove it, would be easy if it could just give the person's home address :p
