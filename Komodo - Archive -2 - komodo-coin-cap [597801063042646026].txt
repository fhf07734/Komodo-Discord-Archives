This is the dev channel for the ecosystem dashboard project. The github repo for the core API is hosted at https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-ecosysboard/ - @Slyris is the dev and implementing this.

The (codename) "ecoboard" project is split into 2 subprojects:

A) the backend layer (above github repo) is a (golang) service that fetches ecosystem project related infos/data from various publicly accessible APIs - this includes blockexplorers [kmdexplorer.io, vrsc.kmdexplorer.io,...], coin market APIs [coinmarketcap, coingecko,...] and other 3rd party APIs. Furthermore this system persists a specific set of data locally (last price, blockchain statistic numbers, etc.) and serves a publicly accessible API so that other 3rd party projects can utilize it. The backend  can also request realtime data from external APIs like current blockchain stats by forwarding a request to external endpoints. 

B) the frontend layer is a mobile ready (responsive) website based on dashboard templates. This website interacts with the backend layer from A) - e.g. users can view data (get) or send specific requests (post) like blockexplorer queries.

external APIs we fetch the data from:

**blockexplorer data sources:** 
`*.kmdexplorer.io` where `*` is replaced with the ticker symbol of the chain. e.g. https://vrsc.kmdexplorer.io/ or https://pirate.kmdexplorer.io/ and 
`*.explorer.dexstats.info` resulting in https://k64.explorer.dexstats.info/ etc. - some chains aren't available on kmdexplorer.io but on the latter. 


**market stats (prices,...):**
https://www.coingecko.com/en/api
https://www.coinmarketcap.com

@ca333 "Furthermore this system persists a specific set of data locally (last price, blockchain statistic numbers, etc.)"

This means that we have to use a cache redis or a database ?


[08-Jul-19 11:01 AM] ca333#0333
yes - i think something like redis or mongo is enough for our purpose @Slyris


[08-Jul-19 11:02 AM] Slyris#2880
ok, coinmarket api is not free, do you have an api key ?


[08-Jul-19 11:02 AM] Slyris#2880
(since is not a personnal use)


[08-Jul-19 11:02 AM] ca333#0333
i see - in this case use only coingecko for now


[08-Jul-19 11:02 AM] Slyris#2880
ok


[08-Jul-19 11:03 AM] Slyris#2880
for the kmdexplorer and dexstats, do we have a documentation for those api ?


[08-Jul-19 11:14 AM] ca333#0333
they are both based on `insight` explorer and their API is pretty straight forward: https://gist.github.com/jackzampolin/da3201b89d23dd5fa3becb0185da1fb2 

both API endpoits serve under `insight-api-komodo` in our case. 
e.g. `http://kmd.explorer.dexstats.info/insight-api-komodo/addr/RSp8vhyL6hN3yqn5V1qje62pBgBE9fv3Eh`


[08-Jul-19 11:18 AM] ca333#0333
we will fetch a specific set of general blockchain infos of all chains into the persistence layer: current blockchain height, blockhash, and so on. 
And more specific infos like the example api url from above are the user-specific requests (not for the persistence layer). So our ecosysboard backend will just forward this requests to the explorer APIs.

@ca333 I added you on the pull request, a basic http router and a ping request on the coingecko api for you to get an idea of ​​the architecture of the program.

The coverage decrease, but this is not a problem, some part are just not testable since we use external apis

Hi, the `coingecko` API is clearly according to the documentation no complete at all and only works with ethereum for most of the requests, so I started with the insight  apis of komodo, i will push my first request of `kmd dexstats explorer`

For now I have no cache management, we will see how we want to manage our cache, on which elements in particular.

How much do the paid API's cost? Like coinmarketcap API. If it's not anything too crazy we could consider paying for it.

coincodex API... sure if you think it's good!


[09-Jul-19 09:25 AM] Slyris#2880
I think coincodex api is poor, but free. and for coinmarket cap we can be limited


[09-Jul-19 09:25 AM] Audo#5667
should be, yes. What does that cost? But if we achieve the same with coincodex then we can opt-in to use that


[09-Jul-19 09:25 AM] Slyris#2880
So maybe we should just try, and look if it's fit


[09-Jul-19 09:25 AM] Audo#5667
ok

Hey guys,

The rebranded website also has few stat boxes. IBN is asking if we will have these data points ready for the launch (this week). If not, then they will be scoped out from the rebrand release.

- Last Github Commit (would have to check the details, I think it's supposed to say something like "Last commit by ca333 made 39 minutes ago"
- Total Github Commits (we would have to add commits from multiple repos together)
- Most Commits Placed (who has made the last commits in some given period of time, like 30 days)
- Atomic Swaps in last 24 hours
- 24 Hour swap volume
- Number of Liquid KMD pairs (KMD pairs above some arbitrary treshold trading volume value)

> these data points are supposed to be on the site. the best way to do this is to provide us with an API endpoint that gives us all of this data at once in one call. could you work with someone on this on your end before end of week? otherwise we will need to descope it for the launch

Just let me know if we can finish any of these, if not, no problem. IBN just needs to know if they should plan it in the first version or into a post rebrand version.


[09-Jul-19 01:34 PM] ca333#0333
Hi @Audo - the github stats can be fetched from the github API. We have not included this into the current backend, but can add this in the future.

The atomic swap count is not tracked right now and i am not sure if its technically possible to track the global swap count. We will figure this out.


[09-Jul-19 01:36 PM] ca333#0333
We can check the orderbook of the main netid in order to show liquid pairs - however, there could be much more ("invisible") orders up.

Once you guys take a closer look at the templates we could see if we can also showcase our roadmap on the dashboard.

I was looking at several dashboard templates yesterday and thinking about it. We could simply use 'cards' that have some heading, graphic, and a sentence description about the technology (such as  AtomicAPI), and then it has a link to a more detailed post about this specific thing.

`typo, it's status alright ?` - yes - typo
`for the moment i will get the currency exchange price from the dexstat api, or you want me to get it from directly from binance,hitbtc,bittrex etc ?` - it would be very handy if we could fetch the prices from wherever they are available - dexstats, coingecko,... - but if the current solution is fully functional we can stick to one API (dexstats) for now and add others later. Would be also good to figure out if dexstats itself uses coingecko or other 3rd party APIs ( @Mylo can you check with CHMEX please?)
`Are post requests necessary for ecosysboard ?` - yes, we actually wanted to add a search field to ecosysboard frontend like in https://www.kmdexplorer.io/ - users could post address, blockhash, txhash or height as input and `ecosysboard` checks if a matching record was found in insight and redirects the user to the corresponding url.

[10-Jul-19 09:15 PM] Slyris#2880
Ok I will add the post request and the redirection today with dexstats once we have a fully dexstats functional ready ecosysboard backend, we can start playing with the front-end and add other APIs step by step

@ca333 Hello !


[11-Jul-19 10:49 AM] Slyris#2880
When you do a search on https://kmdexplorer.io is behind you make a request block, if it is not a block I test if it is a transaction, if it is not a transaction I test if it's an address? Or do you have some kind of parser that automatically detects it's an address, a block or a transaction, if so I guess this parsing is accessible somewhere?

`you make a request block, if it is not a block I test if it is a transaction, if it is not a transaction I test if it's an address?` - lets only forward the request to the AP IF the user-input is pre-validated and filtered as best as we can to prevent explorer API spam:
If its a decimal number <= current blockheight its a block.
If its a 27 - 34 chars long base58 encoded string (prefix byte `60`dec / `3C`hex resulting in all KMD addresses starting with `R`) we know its an address (komodod has a `validateaddress`
 call but you can also use any base58 lib to validate the userinput). And if its a 32 byte long HEX its likely a TX ID or blockhash - check for TX hash first since endusers are more likely going to look for TXs.


[12-Jul-19 01:22 AM] Slyris#2880
As the komodo is not the only currency to manage, the other addresses do not parse in the same way? I planned to make a register that associates a regex to a currency, so we would have the same function regardless of the currency

@ca333  are you agree with :

```
^[R][a-km-zA-HJ-NP-Z1-9]{27,34}$
```

For komodo address ?


[12-Jul-19 01:34 AM] ca333#0333
`^[R][a-km-zA-HJ-NP-Z1-9]{27,34}$`

yes - this regex looks "good" - however, for your info: if i remember correctly i had cases where the regex returned true BUT a base58 validateaddress() returned false. I personally always advice against regex checks for address validations - but in our case (since its just a explorer query) we can do it to prevent you from integrating 3rd party base58 library.


[12-Jul-19 01:37 AM] Slyris#2880
Ok, for the moment i stay with the regex


[12-Jul-19 01:38 AM] Slyris#2880
once we have a proof of concept that work, we will look for the details


[12-Jul-19 01:44 AM] jl777c#5810
addresses last 4 bytes are checksum, so even if valid chars very few that pass the regex are valid addresses


[12-Jul-19 01:48 AM] Slyris#2880
Yes but in practice, I use regex only to filter the type of input, then if someone searches for an incorrect address, it will just get an error.

yes for now thats fine - once we get into details we can optimize the API query "pre-filter"

SHA256 @Slyris

you write 32 bytes long, it's more no ?


[12-Jul-19 02:21 AM] ca333#0333
sha256 generates a 256-bit (32-byte) hash

ah no because  32 separate hexadecimal numbers (or 32 bytes) each one representing 8 of the bits in the hash.

The post request send back a json with the url to redirect in the explorer.

like:

ah yes we have tickers for the price


[12-Jul-19 12:00 PM] Slyris#2880
for example:

https://api.coinpaprika.com/v1/tickers/kmd-komodo

so we have to specify `kmd-komodo` instead of just `kmd`


[12-Jul-19 12:01 PM] Slyris#2880
so i will probably need a registry that associate

```go
{"kmd", "kmd-komodo"},
{"btc", "btc-bitcoin"}
```

to make it work properly

```


[14-Jul-19 04:23 AM] ca333#0333
In addition to the market infos and last blockhash lets also add:

```
"blocks": 1442348,
"notarized": 1442330,
"notarizedhash": "00000000bf1b83fd71b1dabe7d0c9e2d5401f69d9df492f42e1ab0ad52fdcbd9",
"notarizedtxid": "4f7fd6a5905a93ac443dce7f4df932ce72a638afe45db8862d6774cecff8fb11",
```

When you pull these infos always ensure that the node we pull it from has `connections>2` (to ensure the node is "online" and knows about the current network stats) and `blocks==longestchain (to ensure the node is synced) - if this conditions are not met the node is likely still syncing or "offline" or so..


[14-Jul-19 07:12 AM] Slyris#2880
@ca333  is `longestchain` equivalent to  `blockChainHeight`

for 

```json
{"status":"finished","blockChainHeight":1442534,"syncPercentage":100,"height":1442534,"error":null,"type":"bitcore node"}
```


[14-Jul-19 07:16 AM] Slyris#2880
if sync percentage is equal to 100 we can assume that the node is synced ?


[14-Jul-19 07:17 AM] Slyris#2880
and if the status is finished ?


[14-Jul-19 07:20 AM] Slyris#2880
like `nodeIsSynced = (status == "finished") && (syncPercentage == "100")` ?


[14-Jul-19 07:41 AM] Slyris#2880
for the moment i handle it this way:

```go
currentCoin.NodeIsSynced = node.Status == "finished" && node.SyncPercentage == 100
currentCoin.NodeIsOnline = currentCoin.BlockInfo.Info.Connections > 2
if currentCoin.NodeIsSynced && currentCoin.NodeIsOnline {
   currentCoin.NotarizedHash = CBlockHashFromHeightDexstats(key, fmt.Sprintf("%d", currentCoin.BlockInfo.Info.Notarized)).BlockHash
}
```


[14-Jul-19 07:52 AM] ca333#0333
i believe `currentCoin.NodeIsSynced = node.Status == "finished" && node.BlockChainHeight == node.Height` would be more appropriate since `node.SyncPercentage` likely is not precise enough.


[14-Jul-19 07:55 AM] Slyris#2880

[14-Jul-19 07:55 AM] Slyris#2880

```json

    ...
  ]
```


[14-Jul-19 07:59 AM] Slyris#2880
do you want all the transaction of the notarizedhash ?


[14-Jul-19 07:59 AM] Slyris#2880
as  notarizedtxid ?


[14-Jul-19 08:41 AM] ca333#0333
you can just return the array as notarizedtxid - we can then link each txid to a public bitcoin explorer (in the frontend)


[14-Jul-19 09:06 AM] Slyris#2880
@ca333 Ok thank's

For datatypes json I use a generator that translates the json into golang structure, if I made mistakes I would correct them. But where can I find the specifics of types that are ambiguous. As the integer numbers should be floats, if the json sends me "3" I can not guess that it's actually a float

Regarding the part that needs to be cached, I'm waiting to see the first performances we'll have at the query level. On my side it looks pretty fast for now.


[14-Jul-19 01:29 PM] Slyris#2880
We should also look in more detail golang packages that I chose to use. I am rather confident of their safety and robustness. But I would need the advice of someone probably safe.

I would like us us to do some short of "state of development" page / pages where we give an outlook about current and future development (short of a roadmap). @Mylo has been looking into this already with the template that everyone seemed to like.

However, that template lacks some rich text editing tools. We should have a way to post long form text (like blogs) that is nice to read.


[17-Jul-19 07:41 AM] Audo#5667
part of that would be a list of Antara modules. We would have basic info about each module (description, name of developer, development status, link to documentation)


[17-Jul-19 07:41 AM] ca333#0333
Are we providing the content/text or does this get delivered from the projects?


[17-Jul-19 07:42 AM] Audo#5667
We would of course write the final content, I haven't had time to get into that though


[17-Jul-19 07:42 AM] Mylo#8306 (pinned)
https://coreui.io/demo/dark/#editors/markdown-editor.html it has rich editor.  I can look if srsly considering so soon.

sounds good


[17-Jul-19 07:44 AM] ca333#0333
We will already start with the front-end layer today but it wont take us long to implement it. Based on that we polish the visuals and get the first version online. This actually equals a early beta. From there we can extend the backend with this "dev status page" data. This feature for instance seems very easy to implement (basically just text parser with some formats).


[17-Jul-19 07:46 AM] Audo#5667
ok, and could we host it in ecosystem.komodoplatform.com?

another question: do you guys want design ux/ui help from IBN?


[17-Jul-19 07:46 AM] Audo#5667
Steve will negotiate with them about the future in near future


[17-Jul-19 07:47 AM] Mylo#8306
Ok cool.  I’m free of front end stuff that sounds....happy to test/bugfix cos I’d rather look at autoscaling kmd on cloud systems tbh

hey guys, thanks for all the work! This project is progressing with a lightning speed it feels.

I wanted to showcase more statistic on our rebranded site, but when we designed it we did not have those API endpoints ready for IBN. They are now going to make another iteration for the site and add more stuff / functionality.

Can you guys give me a list of API calls / statistics that we would support in ~ 2 weeks from now? I will then scope those in to the website design/feature list

@Audo - this is the backend documentation with all available API calls and example responses: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-ecosysboard/blob/master/docs/api.md

It is a small and straight forward API. Let me know if there are any questions.

@everyone This is the "Antara Coin Cap" project channel - we built a prototype backend to create a "coinmarketcap" clone for Komodo ecosystem coins (smart chains). We are now looking for a web/frontend dev to build a realtime webapp based on a theme like https://coreui.io/demo/dark/#main.html - what we envision is a web-application similar to coinmarketcap with all relevant infos of a coin and in addition we also show a few blockchain infos (realtime stats) like current height, dPoW status, etc. ON the landing page list - and when someone clicks on a specific chain the detail-view is shown with all available infos. The API documentation and source code are pinned. If you are interested in this task or have questions please contact me or @Slyris through DM.

Whale Alert. Live tracking of large crypto transactions from and to exchanges


[24-Jul-19 06:25 AM] owerache#0341
it seems to me that you have access to the blockchain data after that it's just setintervall: D which is connected either in RPC or via an API but it's obvious


[24-Jul-19 06:26 AM] Slyris#2880
We talk around 6pm I will explain you why it's can be little bit tricky


[24-Jul-19 06:28 AM] owerache#0341
if you want... but I really think there's a way to produce this via a KMD node and a small API


[24-Jul-19 06:31 AM] Slyris#2880
Yes but this is probably ot of scope for the moment


[24-Jul-19 06:31 AM] Slyris#2880
But if we can have some exchange volume from #🤝│dex-mobile I would love to add this feature


[24-Jul-19 06:33 AM] owerache#0341
Well the same, via API you could share all public offers in real time on discord/twitter and other network as well as daily volumes


[24-Jul-19 06:35 AM] Slyris#2880
Yes this I can do it totally


[24-Jul-19 06:36 AM] Slyris#2880
But I suspect whales alert to put a watcher on big wallet and periodically check for new transaction from them


[24-Jul-19 06:36 AM] Slyris#2880
(I don't like it personally, but if this is a needed feature why not)


[24-Jul-19 08:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
this is already really easy to do from a node and a few hours of work, funds tracking is a walk in the park


[24-Jul-19 08:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
(I already did this in production, but don't report the values, it was used to track the hacker's funds)


[24-Jul-19 08:21 AM] Slyris#2880
May be but do we really need this feature urgently ? To tracks whales !


[24-Jul-19 08:21 AM] Slyris#2880
?

there s a huge difference betweek reported values and fake volumes submitted via API

blockchain never lies, if you know how to gather infos


[24-Jul-19 08:23 AM] Slyris#2880
I think that if I can have the volume from mm2 Dex it's can be cool


[24-Jul-19 08:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
you can do far more than that


[24-Jul-19 08:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
relying on specific tools you also can parse which coin gets the most volume for a specific pair


[24-Jul-19 08:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
and adapt the marketing strategy

I need to get used to the API before, hopefully in a few weeks, but this is really something easy to do once you got any node running

Ok great !

Not exactly API agnostic at the moment for obvious reason

as long as it is audited and validated, there is no harm, specifically if you don t use any external lib

[24-Jul-19 08:38 AM] Slyris#2880
For the security team


[24-Jul-19 08:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
yeah


[24-Jul-19 08:39 AM] Slyris#2880
With all my explanation


[24-Jul-19 08:39 AM] Slyris#2880
I carefully choose my dependencies


[24-Jul-19 08:39 AM] Slyris#2880
And I lock specific commit, they are not revertable or falsifiable.


[24-Jul-19 08:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
even py use some like requests or all, but ad long as it s a core one and not an external one it s safer


[24-Jul-19 08:39 AM] Slyris#2880
Advantage of Golang modules.


[24-Jul-19 08:40 AM] Deleted User#0000
I should really look at this

Might be helpful to enrich it with totalsupply info.
I can deploy it to all explorers.


[24-Jul-19 10:29 AM] CHMEX#0686
And there is extended info

[24-Jul-19 10:55 AM] Slyris#2880
@CHMEX I'm using dextats explorer so it's should work


[24-Jul-19 10:56 AM] Slyris#2880
Can you open issue with this feature request so i let you know when i implement it


[24-Jul-19 11:01 AM] CHMEX#0686

For the next features you want to see in the `komodo coinmarketcap` like thanks to open issues in the github repository with your ideas so that we can not forget them, it allows to have a discussion follow even if we can also talk about discord.


[24-Jul-19 12:19 PM] Slyris#2880

@Audo Hello


[24-Jul-19 12:37 PM] Slyris#2880
Do you have a link for downloading the core ui pro paid assets ?


[24-Jul-19 12:37 PM] Slyris#2880
So i can start putting it in the repository


[24-Jul-19 12:57 PM] jacman#4756
I’ve never heard of this project before? Is this an open source decentralized version of coinmarketcap?


[24-Jul-19 01:06 PM] Slyris#2880
Not exactly is an open source coinmarketcap of komodo ecosystem related chains, coins, currency, tokens


[24-Jul-19 01:06 PM] Slyris#2880
@jacman


[24-Jul-19 01:07 PM] Slyris#2880
The channel is open since today only, that's why.


[24-Jul-19 02:51 PM] Audo#5667
@Mylo , do you have the core UI assets? Can you forward them to @Slyris ?


[24-Jul-19 02:52 PM] Audo#5667
@jacman the vision of this project is to become a dashboard that showcases Komodo ecosystem.


[24-Jul-19 10:51 PM] Mylo#8306
i have a licensed version of the coreui stuff, cannot be made open source.   what assets are required specifically?

[25-Jul-19 06:09 AM] dukeleto#7326
ok, no worries. How many repos is reasonable?


[25-Jul-19 06:09 AM] dukeleto#7326
most of our commits are in maybe 5 repos, but we have a few dozen


[25-Jul-19 06:09 AM] Slyris#2880
Unlimited


[25-Jul-19 06:10 AM] dukeleto#7326
ok, i can get you a list


[25-Jul-19 06:10 AM] Slyris#2880
It's will be stored in a cache anyway

[25-Jul-19 06:16 AM] Slyris#2880
Now that you talk to me about sideschains like `HUSH` I wonder if I'd be better off associating a repo list with an organization


[25-Jul-19 06:17 AM] Slyris#2880
Such has
```json
{
[
   "KomodoPlatform": ["repo1", "repo2"],
   "Hush": ["repo1", "repo2"]
]
}
```


[25-Jul-19 06:19 AM] ca333#0333
for most ecosystem projects the `KomodoPlatform` org will cover it. 
For a few projects like VRSC and HUSH this is necessary - yes.


[25-Jul-19 06:19 AM] Slyris#2880
Because for the moment we have:

```json
"git_repos_list": [
    "https://github.com/pbca26/komodo-omni-explorer.git",
    "https://github.com/jl777/komodo.git",
    "https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API.git",

    "https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/Agama.git"
  ]
```


[25-Jul-19 06:20 AM] Slyris#2880
Which are not specified to an specific Organisation


[25-Jul-19 06:20 AM] ca333#0333
however, we can list project-specific git-status for such projects - BUT i want the sum of all commits and stats to be under the "KomodoPlatform" umbrella since its the "mothership".


[25-Jul-19 06:21 AM] Slyris#2880
ok great


[25-Jul-19 06:21 AM] Slyris#2880
is RedFox considered as a part of KomodoPlatform ?


[25-Jul-19 06:21 AM] Slyris#2880
for example


[25-Jul-19 06:21 AM] ca333#0333
its an ecosystem project ("Smart Chain") - yes


[25-Jul-19 06:22 AM] Slyris#2880
```json
"coins": [
    {
      "coin": "kmd",
      "coin_paprika_id": "kmd-komodo",
     "mothership": "KomodoPlatform"
    }
```

so i will change the structure to that for example


[25-Jul-19 06:22 AM] Slyris#2880
so "hush" will be associated to his platform


[25-Jul-19 06:23 AM] ca333#0333
this split wont be really necessary - so you dont have to restructure according to the above struct

In fact KMD is the mothership of all ecosystem projects - even VRSC or HUSH


[25-Jul-19 06:24 AM] Slyris#2880
yes but when someone will click on the komodo page he wont see the github pages of HUSH


[25-Jul-19 06:24 AM] Slyris#2880
it's what i mean


[25-Jul-19 06:24 AM] ca333#0333
yes - we agree on this.


[25-Jul-19 06:24 AM] Slyris#2880
so We need to find a way of association


[25-Jul-19 06:25 AM] Slyris#2880
that fit to everyone


[25-Jul-19 06:27 AM] ca333#0333
so we are likely looking for :

```
"coins": [
    {
      "coin": "kmd",
      "coin_paprika_id": "kmd-komodo",
     "git": []
    }
```

where `git` is an array of github repo URLs.


[25-Jul-19 06:27 AM] Slyris#2880
ok


[25-Jul-19 06:27 AM] Slyris#2880
some coins will have same repository alright ?


[25-Jul-19 06:28 AM] Slyris#2880
anyway i already handle this kind of configuration:

```go
else {
        _ = glg.Infof("Repository %s already cloned", urlRepo)
    }
```


[25-Jul-19 06:29 AM] ca333#0333
for sake of non-redundancy we can flag ecosys projects that reuse the komodo repos and dont have an own git account so we dont have to repeat same config entry.


[25-Jul-19 06:29 AM] ca333#0333
it would also be interesting to see actually


[25-Jul-19 06:30 AM] ca333#0333
which projects have their own repos and codes, wallets, tools, etc. and which projects dont...


[25-Jul-19 06:30 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Slyris it would be smart of your code to know the difference between a pure smart chain and a source fork


[25-Jul-19 06:30 AM] dukeleto#7326
VRSC and HUSH are source forks, maybe you could consider PIRATE one, but mostly they use the main KMD repo. Pirate does have it's own github org, tho

{Reactions}
👆 (3) 

[25-Jul-19 06:34 AM] ca333#0333
yes - lets add `source_fork: bool isSourceFork`


[25-Jul-19 06:35 AM] ca333#0333
so VRSC and HUSH are `true` - rest should be false.

i use KMD codebase for my PIRATE nodes - so should be safe to set ARRR to `false`

such as: https://api.github.com/orgs/KomodoPlatform/repos ?


[25-Jul-19 06:50 AM] Slyris#2880
@ca333


[25-Jul-19 07:00 AM] ca333#0333
yes exactly @Slyris


[25-Jul-19 07:00 AM] Slyris#2880
Great i got it 😃


[25-Jul-19 07:01 AM] Slyris#2880
But what if fork collapse with Org @ca333  ?


[25-Jul-19 07:01 AM] Slyris#2880
Such has @jl777c  we prefer use his repo of komodo instead of the one from the org


[25-Jul-19 07:02 AM] ca333#0333
lets list both in this special case - jl777 repos are considered the dev-repos while on KP we host the official/production repos.


[25-Jul-19 07:05 AM] Slyris#2880
ok


[25-Jul-19 07:05 AM] Slyris#2880
so i will clone into Org/UserName repos then.


[25-Jul-19 07:45 AM] Slyris#2880
@ca333 GitHub Apps making server-to-server requests use the installation's minimum rate limit of 5,000 requests per hour. Organization installations with more than 20 users receive another 50 requests per hour for each user. Installations that have more than 20 repositories receive another 50 requests per hour for each repository. The maximum rate limit for an installation is 12,500 requests per hour.


i Will fetch data only one time per hour ok ?

✅ 

[25-Jul-19 07:46 AM] Slyris#2880
Becuase it's does lot of request


[25-Jul-19 07:47 AM] ca333#0333
once an hour is fine for now - but lets target `"real-time"` for the future


[25-Jul-19 07:48 AM] Slyris#2880
How can we target real time if github is limiting our request rates


[25-Jul-19 07:48 AM] Slyris#2880
i mean we will reach it so fast


[25-Jul-19 07:49 AM] ca333#0333
Integrating the github-stats fetcher into ecosys-board instead of using github API. 
e.g. you can fetch any website low-level (curl, etc.) and parse it however you want - this means we could be fetching any github org page and parsing it in html to get all repositories recursively, etc.


[25-Jul-19 07:50 AM] Slyris#2880
Ah yeah we will do that later


[25-Jul-19 07:50 AM] ca333#0333
so as you can see: realtime is possible, not even hard to implement - even if we had to write our own github page parser


[25-Jul-19 07:50 AM] Slyris#2880
Ok it's not urgent for the moment i think


[25-Jul-19 07:51 AM] ca333#0333
but for now we can use all these 3rd party APIs for everything


[25-Jul-19 07:51 AM] ca333#0333
exactly - for now we just want to get the base system up and running.


[25-Jul-19 07:51 AM] ca333#0333
and from there we can keep optimizing such things


[25-Jul-19 07:51 AM] Slyris#2880

are you here @ca333 I got few questions for the next steps


[25-Jul-19 11:58 PM] ca333#0333
next steps: we stop feature-additions and start with the frontend-layer. Do we have interested parties for the bounty task? i.e. have you already been contacted by potential webdevs?

[26-Jul-19 12:11 AM] ca333#0333
@Slyris todays workpackage:

a) get a responsive reactJS skeleton set up for the landing page view (smartchain table/list)
b) integrate https://coreui.io/demo/#main.html and make sure the frontend is responsive

Details we do want in a) are coinname, marketcap, coin supply (circulating), 24h volume, 24 price change, price per coin, dPoW status (green or red), current height, and last but not least the dPoW gap (time since last notarization)

@turinglabs you re planning to do it with react?


[26-Jul-19 12:54 AM] turinglabs#2390
It will be faster with vuejs, but if you prefer react I can do with it


[26-Jul-19 12:56 AM] turinglabs#2390
At the end the result will be the same I think


[26-Jul-19 12:57 AM] ca333#0333
vueJS is fine too @turinglabs


[26-Jul-19 12:57 AM] ca333#0333
this is basically the first step: https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/597801063042646026/604209147935981580

As golang imports use the user's name I had to change `Milerius` for `KomodoPlatform`

@turinglabs There will be an addition in the configuration to add the path to the frontend folder (to serve the index.html)


[26-Jul-19 02:31 AM] Slyris#2880
Nevertheless, there are solutions to overcome such as packer or appimage if we want a single binary

@Slyris frontend and backend will be in the same server?

@turinglabs I think it's better


[26-Jul-19 02:54 AM] Slyris#2880
@turinglabs And how can i serve the files if we are not in the same server

[26-Jul-19 02:55 AM] Slyris#2880
with vue


[26-Jul-19 02:57 AM] Slyris#2880
you build to a folder like "web/dist" and i serve this folder


[26-Jul-19 02:57 AM] Slyris#2880
For development mode you launch both app and the front end call the back-end layer


[26-Jul-19 02:57 AM] Slyris#2880
Everything is explained in the readme from this repository it's really simple !


[26-Jul-19 03:02 AM] ca333#0333
@Slyris it should be fully up to @turinglabs how to implement it. i.e. since the ecosys-board is a normal API he can just grab the data from there without having to use the go-vue-template


[26-Jul-19 03:02 AM] ca333#0333
i.e. the frontend is completely independent of the backend.


[26-Jul-19 03:02 AM] Slyris#2880
he dont have to use the template, it's just an example ^^'


[26-Jul-19 03:03 AM] Slyris#2880
Usually once the frontend is builded, i serve the folder and everything work, but if there is another solution i trust him


[26-Jul-19 03:03 AM] ca333#0333
`you build to a folder like "web/dist" and i serve this folder` - this sounded irritating. The backend is an API so he can grab the data from the endpoints on a specific host:port but not on a folder.


[26-Jul-19 03:04 AM] Slyris#2880
Okok !

So i revert the change of my commits wait


[26-Jul-19 03:05 AM] turinglabs#2390
@Slyris you are right


[26-Jul-19 03:05 AM] turinglabs#2390
vuejs create a build which have to be served statically


[26-Jul-19 03:06 AM] Slyris#2880
as you wish ^^'


[26-Jul-19 03:07 AM] Slyris#2880
i let the decision between you and @ca333


[26-Jul-19 03:07 AM] Slyris#2880
I will adapt my self to the solution


[26-Jul-19 03:07 AM] ca333#0333
you re misunderstanding this @turinglabs - the frontend has to be fully independent of the backend. The backend will NOT serve static data on a specific folder.


[26-Jul-19 03:07 AM] ca333#0333
Data is available through API endpoint - your frontend will fetch this data from the API endpoint.


[26-Jul-19 03:08 AM] ca333#0333
we will not create a combined app out of the backend/frontend. So this is also not necessarily on the same server.


[26-Jul-19 03:08 AM] turinglabs#2390
sure they're independent, but the files should be somewhere if they have to be accessible from an URL


[26-Jul-19 03:08 AM] ca333#0333
We re going to keep this split clean.


[26-Jul-19 03:08 AM] turinglabs#2390
sure sure, i know that


[26-Jul-19 03:10 AM] ca333#0333
yes thats clear - the frontend gets served to a specific endpoint. But the backend will not serve the data to a static dir like its been posted above.


[26-Jul-19 03:11 AM] Slyris#2880
Ok everything is clear for me now


[26-Jul-19 03:11 AM] Slyris#2880
It's even more simple.


[26-Jul-19 03:12 AM] Slyris#2880
@turinglabs Let me know if you have trouble for build back-end for your testing


[26-Jul-19 03:15 AM] ca333#0333
I will supervise the frontend creation @Slyris - you can review the backend a last time, test it, make sure everything works as expected and then we will move to the next project.  For a quality sign off please contact @TonyL once you feel the backend is ready and have him run a final sign off test - he will let me know the status. DM me when you re done with this task.


[26-Jul-19 03:16 AM] Slyris#2880

tried a few variations and paths under $GOPATH to put it in


[26-Jul-19 05:06 AM] Slyris#2880

[26-Jul-19 05:06 AM] Slyris#2880
at the end


[26-Jul-19 05:06 AM] Slyris#2880
it's my bad


[26-Jul-19 05:06 AM] Slyris#2880
there is no point


[26-Jul-19 05:07 AM] Slyris#2880
you copy paste from the readme


[26-Jul-19 05:07 AM] Slyris#2880
with the point


[26-Jul-19 05:07 AM] smkhound#7640
I think even without there is prob, lemme try again


[26-Jul-19 05:07 AM] Slyris#2880
if you build without go module, you need to do `go get "url"` first


[26-Jul-19 05:07 AM] smkhound#7640
where should repo be cloned? and use `go get -u` or `git clone` ?


[26-Jul-19 05:08 AM] Slyris#2880
if you clone it


[26-Jul-19 05:08 AM] Slyris#2880
from everywhere


[26-Jul-19 05:08 AM] Slyris#2880
Use GO111MODULE


[26-Jul-19 05:10 AM] smkhound#7640
```wilburwildcatrose@instance-2:~$ rm -rf go
wilburwildcatrose@instance-2:~$ go get -u github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-ecosysboard/ecosysboard
wilburwildcatrose@instance-2:~$ GO111MODULE=on go build -o komodo-ecosysboard ecosysboard/ecosysboard
can't load package: package ecosysboard/ecosysboard: unknown import path "ecosysboard/ecosysboard": cannot find module providing package ecosysboard/ecosysboard```


[26-Jul-19 05:10 AM] Slyris#2880
let me know if it's work now @smkhound


[26-Jul-19 05:10 AM] Slyris#2880
There is a misunderstanding


[26-Jul-19 05:11 AM] smkhound#7640
not sure I'm missing something elemental


[26-Jul-19 05:11 AM] Slyris#2880
If you use go get


[26-Jul-19 05:11 AM] Slyris#2880
you dont use go mod


[26-Jul-19 05:11 AM] Slyris#2880
if you git clone


[26-Jul-19 05:11 AM] Slyris#2880
you use go mod inside the cloned repository


[26-Jul-19 05:11 AM] Slyris#2880
steps are:

- git clone
- cd in the directory
- build

` go build -o komodo-ecosysboard ecosysboard/ecosysboard.go
stat ecosysboard/ecosysboard.go: no such file or directory`


[26-Jul-19 05:13 AM] Slyris#2880
you are not in the directory


[26-Jul-19 05:13 AM] Slyris#2880
it's not possible


[26-Jul-19 05:13 AM] Slyris#2880
Let's do it again


[26-Jul-19 05:13 AM] Slyris#2880
git clone, then go in the directory


[26-Jul-19 05:13 AM] Slyris#2880

@Slyris ^ when you re back please look into this


[26-Jul-19 05:41 AM] Slyris#2880
yeah


[26-Jul-19 05:41 AM] TonyL#3577
if it asked for gh creds some repo is private I wonder


[26-Jul-19 05:41 AM] Slyris#2880
That's realy strange


[26-Jul-19 05:41 AM] Slyris#2880
i never get this


[26-Jul-19 05:41 AM] ca333#0333
it shouldnt request auth data unless our backend uses it to create an oauth key pair automagically to be used for the request-limit.


[26-Jul-19 05:42 AM] Slyris#2880
He ask cred for cloning.


[26-Jul-19 05:42 AM] Slyris#2880
not for interacting with the github api


[26-Jul-19 05:42 AM] Slyris#2880
but it's strange


[26-Jul-19 05:42 AM] ca333#0333
But i doubt this was implemented already - cant remember such code


[26-Jul-19 05:42 AM] ca333#0333
ok


[26-Jul-19 05:42 AM] Slyris#2880
Travis never get this error


[26-Jul-19 05:42 AM] ca333#0333
the repo is public - so it shouldnt.


[26-Jul-19 05:43 AM] Slyris#2880
Probably a miss git configuration


[26-Jul-19 05:43 AM] Slyris#2880

[26-Jul-19 05:44 AM] Slyris#2880

[26-Jul-19 05:45 AM] Slyris#2880
There is a private field: https://api.github.com/orgs/KomodoPlatform/repos

I could check it before cloning


[26-Jul-19 05:45 AM] Slyris#2880
If it"s an organisation

any frontend devs who want to tap into the api for dev, I've created an endpoint on the http://dragonhound.info/ domain
you can access via the endpoints in https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-ecosysboard/blob/master/docs/api.md
e.g. http://dragonhound.info/api/v1/tickers

@Slyris do you know when the other informations will be available? Like website, github, twitter etc and the datas for the chart?


[07-Aug-19 01:40 AM] Slyris#2880
@turinglabs I have no date in mind I will ask @ca333 during my next meeting and let you know !


[07-Aug-19 01:40 AM] TonyL#3577
@Slyris I think I'm updated because output of http://95.217.44.58/api/v1/tickers became bigger 😃


[07-Aug-19 01:41 AM] turinglabs#2390
i need just that data to complete the frontend, let me know!


[07-Aug-19 01:42 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah ok @turinglabs  I will add something after my coffee, stay around I will ping ylu


[07-Aug-19 01:42 AM] turinglabs#2390
perfect @Slyris


[07-Aug-19 01:44 AM] Slyris#2880
https://api.coinpaprika.com/v1/coins/kmd-komodo


[07-Aug-19 01:44 AM] Slyris#2880
It's will do the job I thinking


[07-Aug-19 01:44 AM] Slyris#2880
@turinglabs


[07-Aug-19 01:44 AM] Slyris#2880
But for coins that are not registered in coinpaprika we need to think about a solution


[07-Aug-19 01:46 AM] turinglabs#2390
coingecko?


[07-Aug-19 01:46 AM] turinglabs#2390
should have everything via api too


[07-Aug-19 01:47 AM] turinglabs#2390
https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/komodo


[07-Aug-19 01:51 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah but again there is coin that are not registered


[07-Aug-19 01:51 AM] turinglabs#2390
we should use both


[07-Aug-19 01:51 AM] smkhound#7640
nice 😃 Now I just need more coin icons - http://dragonhound.info/


[07-Aug-19 01:53 AM] smkhound#7640
coingecko is good, I've been using it for pricing data in mm2


[07-Aug-19 01:53 AM] smkhound#7640
wont have all ecosys coins tho, might need to submit some


[07-Aug-19 01:54 AM] smkhound#7640
can we get mm2 orderbooks data to derive ecosys coins value?


[07-Aug-19 01:59 AM] Slyris#2880
@turinglabs One  api coingecko or coinpaprika is suffisent we just need to choose


[07-Aug-19 01:59 AM] Slyris#2880
between 2 models


[07-Aug-19 02:00 AM] turinglabs#2390
i will fetch directly coingecko or you'll parse the data in any case?


[07-Aug-19 02:00 AM] Slyris#2880
i will parseit


[07-Aug-19 02:00 AM] Slyris#2880
and giveit to you


[07-Aug-19 02:01 AM] turinglabs#2390
perfect, so i just need the final structure


[07-Aug-19 02:01 AM] Slyris#2880
i choose coingecko 😃


[07-Aug-19 02:01 AM] Slyris#2880
yeah


[07-Aug-19 02:01 AM] Slyris#2880

i removed the github service that i written because i was not satified i will rewrite it latter in a more efficient way @Mylo .


[07-Aug-19 03:05 AM] Mylo#8306
ok - thanks for notice @Slyris i will make sure my bash scripts are maintained.


[07-Aug-19 03:06 AM] Slyris#2880
I will probably use only github API to be honest and additional api such as gitlab/bitbucket if needed


[07-Aug-19 03:06 AM] Slyris#2880
but don't need to clone the repository


[07-Aug-19 03:06 AM] Slyris#2880
We can detect the platform, and then fetch and filter the informations

I hope you guys focus on top notch pro reviews of coins and good info that will help people see which coins are good projects, which are scams or money grabs, or urealistic and so on


[08-Aug-19 01:08 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
information is the value added and will attract people


[08-Aug-19 01:10 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
three perspective: technical (blockchain innovation and security) + realistic business + confirmed wise honest team = these measured should allow for easy navigation

btw reserve coinnavi or cryptonavi names if you like, as this is not only about the cap, but actually navigating among coin informations

seem's to timeout)


[09-Aug-19 02:52 AM] smkhound#7640
yeah noticed that when getting gateway error 405


[09-Aug-19 02:53 AM] smkhound#7640
the `coinsupply` RPC takes quite a while in CLI


[09-Aug-19 02:54 AM] smkhound#7640
probably one worth doing less often (every 12 hrs or so) and caching, not sure how @CHMEX serves it

so i think i just have to wait


[09-Aug-19 02:56 AM] CHMEX#0686
Looks like a lot of requests to dexstats at the moment


[09-Aug-19 02:57 AM] CHMEX#0686
I will check


[09-Aug-19 02:57 AM] Slyris#2880
Yes it's probably me


[09-Aug-19 02:57 AM] Slyris#2880
That is doing lot of unit tests


[09-Aug-19 02:57 AM] Slyris#2880
almost 500k


[09-Aug-19 02:57 AM] CHMEX#0686
Lol ok thats might break it indeed


[09-Aug-19 02:57 AM] Slyris#2880
It's seem's like: http://kmd.explorer.dexstats.info/insight-api-komodo//txs?address=RMbNsa4Nf3BAd16BQaAAmfzAgnuorUDrCr 

a call like this one take lot of times


[09-Aug-19 02:57 AM] Slyris#2880
and end with a timeout for me


[09-Aug-19 02:57 AM] Slyris#2880
~20 sec


[09-Aug-19 02:58 AM] CHMEX#0686
Somehow you have // in the url.is that ok?


[09-Aug-19 02:58 AM] Slyris#2880
Yes it's ok


[09-Aug-19 02:58 AM] CHMEX#0686
Ok


[09-Aug-19 02:58 AM] Slyris#2880
Golang perfectly handle this np


[09-Aug-19 02:58 AM] Slyris#2880
In fact unit tests are doing around 20k call, but i run it like 30 times this morning


[09-Aug-19 02:59 AM] Slyris#2880
because i add some features @CHMEX


[09-Aug-19 02:59 AM] Slyris#2880
I'm sorry if i break smth


[09-Aug-19 03:00 AM] CHMEX#0686
It can handle 5m a day from what I have seen but will check maybe some peaks which cause issues


[09-Aug-19 03:00 AM] Slyris#2880
Ok let me know, i will push smth today


[09-Aug-19 03:01 AM] Slyris#2880
for example idk why this broke: http://kmd.explorer.dexstats.info/api//supply


[09-Aug-19 03:01 AM] Slyris#2880
I will eat my lunch , we speak latter


[09-Aug-19 03:01 AM] CHMEX#0686
( this goes to dexstats in the backend)
Enjoy lunch


[09-Aug-19 03:02 AM] Slyris#2880
(so there is a problem with coinsupply from dexstats) ?


[09-Aug-19 04:22 AM] CHMEX#0686
should be ok again. If you don't hit it with 500k reqeusts per minute I think it should be stable. I will try to move it maybe to another server or add some caching. All explorers run on the same box ( but KMD and PIRATE as well as VRSC)  maybe it's time for some new hardware

[09-Aug-19 05:00 AM] Slyris#2880
Do you think that you can do a pull request to the project on travis.yml so it's automatically deploy to this endpoint ?


[09-Aug-19 05:00 AM] Slyris#2880
@TonyL


[09-Aug-19 05:02 AM] TonyL#3577
Will do - some CD is needed  yep


[09-Aug-19 05:03 AM] Slyris#2880
Ok, May be we can think about heroku i hear it's really easy to deploy with heroku/travis


[09-Aug-19 05:03 AM] Slyris#2880
But i dont know yet

https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/heroku/


[09-Aug-19 05:03 AM] TonyL#3577
Me neither, need to research a little bit - my current endpoint is on just dedicated server


[09-Aug-19 05:04 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah that's why i'm suggesting heroku


[09-Aug-19 05:09 AM] smkhound#7640
probably a backwards way to do it, but I coded some py last week to check repos and update / build if new for kmd / mm2 / nspv. was gonna maybe cron it, and intended to do same for my endpoint.

but no crash what strange

https://transfer.sh/1GqMW/reg_stdout.log and regular stdout


[16-Aug-19 07:53 AM] Slyris#2880
@TonyL that's strange because there is nothing about a crash


[16-Aug-19 07:53 AM] Slyris#2880
And I'm sure that if it's crashing Golang will say smth


[16-Aug-19 08:16 AM] Slyris#2880
ok i launch the programm manually on my computer will see in few hours if it's crashing meanwhile this time can you add something that relaunch automatically the programm if it's not running and that remove logs before launching it ? @TonyL


[16-Aug-19 08:20 AM] TonyL#3577
Sure, I’ll be fully online tomorrow and will make such watcher and try to find the reason of stops @Slyris

[16-Aug-19 08:50 AM] Markus#5464
is this project blockchain based?


[16-Aug-19 08:54 AM] ca333#0333
it is basically a coinmarketcap clone with additional blockchain related informations and metrics - we do use the native blockchain interface to fetch infos/data from. However, the coin-cap application itself is not executed "on" the blockchain.


[16-Aug-19 08:55 AM] Markus#5464
Alright, excited to see the results 👍

@TonyL The  programm is running since 17h16 and still no crash

(on my machine)


[16-Aug-19 11:23 AM] TonyL#3577
So issue should be in my machine configuration it seems

@TonyL The programm turn the whole night for me without any problem


[17-Aug-19 03:56 AM] Slyris#2880
i just killed it 5 minute ago


[17-Aug-19 02:00 PM] TonyL#3577
yep, on my laptop working fine for a long time as well, so issue is somewhere in my server configuration

[04-Sep-19 09:56 AM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
is there anyone actively working on the front-end part ? This is my wip using VueJS + Tonyl's endpoint <http://35.159.51.208/coinCap> (I'm still learning things so my progress will be slow 😅 )


[04-Sep-19 10:02 AM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
and about this api call <http://35.159.51.208/coinCap>, most coins use tickers, like /api/v1/kmd or /api/v1/dex  except for Pirate ,  /api/v1/pirate works but /api/v1/arrr doesn't


[04-Sep-19 10:08 AM] Slyris#2880

[04-Sep-19 10:09 AM] Slyris#2880
/api/v1/arrr doesn't work because the good endpoint is pirate

@dukeleto Do you want the instructions for adding Hush into Komodo coincap ?


[07-Sep-19 11:14 AM] Alright#0419
may as well just pin them here


[07-Sep-19 11:16 AM] Slyris#2880 (pinned)
```
https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo-ecosysboard/blob/master/esb_config.json#L7

In this file, just add an new entry with all your information.

if youre coin is not present in coinpaprika or coingecko you can let it empty for coingecko_id and give the same name as the field coin for coinpaprika_id
```

Pinned a message.

Just scrolled through the `esb_config` file, looks like Coinpaprika is on their game


[08-Sep-19 01:03 PM] Slyris#2880
@Regnar What do you mean ?


[08-Sep-19 01:05 PM] Regnar#6164
a good thing, Coinpaprika has always been good for me when I try to add coins and info, so it's no surprise the `coin_paprika_id` field on that entire document is filled


[08-Sep-19 01:05 PM] Slyris#2880
Yeah i designed this configuration file !


[08-Sep-19 01:05 PM] Slyris#2880
So it's easier you parse when developing the application coincap


[08-Sep-19 01:05 PM] Regnar#6164
yea good idea


[08-Sep-19 01:06 PM] Regnar#6164
Is there anything specific we need someone to work on right now? I know some python

glad to see this project moving forward


[13-Oct-19 11:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
let me know if y'all need anything else. for instance, it would be cool to render what % of Hush supply is shielded, stuff like that


[13-Oct-19 11:02 AM] Slyris#2880
Yes and there is 2 another project comming soon


[13-Oct-19 11:02 AM] Slyris#2880
gaming sdk and the makerbot


[13-Oct-19 11:02 AM] Slyris#2880
@dukeleto Is the shielded functionnality something special ?


[13-Oct-19 11:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
only some coins have zaddrs


[13-Oct-19 11:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
KMD does not, ARRR and HUSH do


[13-Oct-19 11:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
most Antara coins have zaddrs enabled


[13-Oct-19 11:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
a few have them disabled


[13-Oct-19 11:04 AM] dukeleto#7326
not sure what you mean by "special"


[13-Oct-19 11:04 AM] Slyris#2880
Hmm


[13-Oct-19 11:04 AM] Slyris#2880
Where we get this information about % shielded ?


[13-Oct-19 11:04 AM] Slyris#2880
Let's say for a specific coin.


[13-Oct-19 11:04 AM] Slyris#2880
dexstats api give us this information ?


[13-Oct-19 11:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
nope


[13-Oct-19 11:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
but it could

[13-Oct-19 11:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
hush has an api endpoint for it, i must look up what it is


[13-Oct-19 11:06 AM] dukeleto#7326
there is a `coinsupply` RPC


[13-Oct-19 11:06 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah but adding specific cases for specific coins is not a good idea


[13-Oct-19 11:06 AM] Slyris#2880
if i can have it through an official RPC call yeah


[13-Oct-19 11:06 AM] dukeleto#7326
i get it


[13-Oct-19 11:06 AM] dukeleto#7326
i have my own idea to have a site that compares all zcash forks, and that is where this idea comes from


[13-Oct-19 11:06 AM] dukeleto#7326
i have written lots of code to generate this data for Hush, which is  99% done


[13-Oct-19 11:07 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's a lot of work and not something for antara, most likely

Hey. Are there Russian speakers here?
I was told to update the wallet to version 0 2 5. deleted, installed a new one, entered the saved SEED. It took 2 times to enter the password and 2 times to enter the PIN code. There are no test coins and transaction history inside. black screen. I don’t remember the name of the old wallet. It was required to give a name.

What's the status of this project? 

The original inspiration for this project was to make a coinmarket capitlization page that only lists coins that are traded on an atomic swap powered DEX. The page would also show DEX trading volumes and list all the DEXes. Very similar to coinmarketcap.com but only for atomic swaps.

I guess we are almost there, right?

We still have a domain http://atomicmarketcap.com/ – would we use this domain for this project? By listing the DEX markets the site would advertise all the DEXes that use atomic swaps (currently only AtomicDEX & HyperDEX), similarly how you can check all the CEX markets for Komodo from coinmarketcap.com

Once we are off the beta and get liquidity we could use the site as an advertising campaign to make people aware about atomic swap trading and about how it is the future.

What I can say at the moment is that we are actually only listing the coin of the Komodo environment and -> that are traded on an atomic swap powered DEX.

On the other hand we have no information concerning the historical data of atomicDEX, which is necessary to display the volume of swap for example (it was not present at the time of the development of this application) Maybe those data are available via API's today?


[15-Dec-19 03:08 AM] Slyris#2880
Currently the project is using: Dexstats for coins info related to Komodo

Coingecko + Coinpaprika for coins that are active (fetching prices, ignoring for test-coins and innactive coins)


[15-Dec-19 03:09 AM] Slyris#2880
I see that on https://dexstats.info we can see the 24h volume for Swaps etc, but i don't know if the API is open-source to get those information.

So we currently have a program that fetch information about currencies in the komodo universe. But we have no information concerning the decentralized exchange.

Once those historical data will be available from some endpoint, we can integrate it into the current application


[15-Dec-19 03:22 AM] Alright#0419
I have scripts that can pull historical trade mm2 data from on chain @Slyris


[15-Dec-19 03:22 AM] Slyris#2880
We have the possibility to host it into an open endpoint ?

working on incorporating a db into them, they take a long while to run

What we need will be something like an official api for mm2 historical data


[15-Dec-19 03:22 AM] Alright#0419
I'll run an oracle on LABS chain with LABS/KMD data at first

[15-Dec-19 03:27 AM] Slyris#2880
i think @jl777c tell me that was possible on mm1/barterDex


[15-Dec-19 03:27 AM] Alright#0419
you can get real time data from mm2 seed nodes, but I don't think you can get historical


[15-Dec-19 03:27 AM] gcharang#6833
> yes, want what I have so far?

> is terribly slow, needs a db behind it so it can do it in real time
sqlite should be enough correct?

are you using nSPV ?


[15-Dec-19 03:27 AM] Alright#0419
and that limits who can run it, we can't add a tonne of seed nodes

Anyway, this is not the kind of data that I need to request all the time, but only a few times a day.


[15-Dec-19 03:30 AM] Alright#0419
my plan is to have two oracles on LABS at first. One that will show any part of the swap as it happens(shortly after really) and one that will show only completed trades


[15-Dec-19 03:30 AM] Slyris#2880
After that it is sure that if we want real time with the history of swaps on the last minutes, it will be more complicated


[15-Dec-19 03:30 AM] gcharang#6833
> explorer can work if I'm whitelisted in rate limiter
maybe switch to use electrum servers?


[15-Dec-19 03:32 AM] Alright#0419 (pinned)
basic logic is... 

on alice chain, get DEX fee txids
iterate through these(or just do them shortly after they happen once db is incorporated)
find alice->b_addr (alice chain)
from there find b_addr->bob (alice chain)
look at b_addr->bob tx, from here we know the script that b_addr->alice must be on bob chain
search for corresponding tx on bob chain in Alice address

[15-Dec-19 03:50 AM] cipi#4502
i would like to see mm2 providing this data, directly, in real time
data should include: last_price, 24h volume and live orderbook (this is what most sites like cmc and coinpaprika will request)
the seed nodes are already storing the data, but it would be best to have a special type of nodes, statnodes, where this data is sent (anonymized, without involved addresses) instead of the seed nodes (the seed nodes should only be used for orderbook propagation)


[15-Dec-19 03:51 AM] Alright#0419
no point in anonymizing, the data is on chain anyway


[15-Dec-19 03:52 AM] Alright#0419
would be better to tell people "hey, look at all this data. It's open for everyone to see. Keep that in mind"


[15-Dec-19 03:53 AM] cipi#4502
you are right, Alright 🙂 ... data is on chain, so no need for anonymizing


[15-Dec-19 03:53 AM] Slyris#2880
i would love a simple rpc call to access this data i agree with @cipi


[15-Dec-19 03:54 AM] Slyris#2880
I think it's a lot of work, so for the moment, we can use custom solution


[15-Dec-19 03:54 AM] Slyris#2880
also data to construct charts would be interesting too


[15-Dec-19 03:55 AM] cipi#4502
problem with analyzing the data from the seed nodes atm is that it only contains historical data, no orderbook
would be nice, if this data could be retrieved from a single node


[15-Dec-19 03:55 AM] Alright#0419
if we wanted better privacy, HD wallets would throw a wrench in all of this


[15-Dec-19 03:55 AM] Alright#0419
more obfuscation than privacy though


[15-Dec-19 03:59 AM] Alright#0419
the idea that a private netid gives you privacy is flawed. If it uses same DEX fee address, it's easily tracked


[15-Dec-19 04:00 AM] Alright#0419
Aha dex fee could be paid to a 1of2 address with DEX address and random garbage address


[15-Dec-19 04:01 AM] Alright#0419
would still need a way for jl(or whoever is managing DEX address) to track them though


[15-Dec-19 04:02 AM] cipi#4502
i don't think it is worth thinking too much about additionally anonymizing the swaps... will be enough work to get the stats working 😉


[15-Dec-19 04:04 AM] Alright#0419
more of a shower thought than a suggestion 😛

[15-Dec-19 06:29 AM] Audo#5667
@Alright , are we able to show how much trading happens on any specific wallet/GUI? Maybe there's no need for that though since the liquidity pool is shared. It would help to rank the DEXes at the very least, in terms of usage.


[15-Dec-19 06:34 AM] gcharang#6833
there is a gui fee address correct?
may be it can be tracked for that data?


[15-Dec-19 06:38 AM] Audo#5667
right, I think so


[15-Dec-19 06:48 AM] Alright#0419
must be tracked from seed node if it's done at all


[15-Dec-19 06:48 AM] Alright#0419
not possible to determine based on the way I'm doing it


[15-Dec-19 06:49 AM] Alright#0419
Oh same concept of 1of2 could be used for DEX address to indicate which GUI it was made from could be used


[15-Dec-19 06:50 AM] Alright#0419
would need to be 2of3 in that case, 1 key provided by GUI dev, 2 owned by whoever is managing DEX address

@ca333 have a nice idea for you there^

if anyone happens to have a list of known completed RICK/MORTY swaps, please give it to me. Can sanity check this script


[15-Dec-19 10:59 AM] phm87#7395
@Alright I'll have a look at your <https://github.com/Alrighttt/atomicdex_volume/> but do you check volume using dexfee address or checking if swaps occured ? How to know if it is an atomic swap of atomicdex or a swap of another tool (outside KMD stuff) ?


[15-Dec-19 11:00 AM] phm87#7395
Second question: Can I use and port your code to another language for one of my secret project (opensource) ?


[15-Dec-19 11:23 AM] Alright#0419
It will only find mm2 protocol swaps that use standard DEX address. It will not find any others.


[15-Dec-19 11:23 AM] Alright#0419
And yes, use it freely, was just meant to demonstrate the logic that can be used


[15-Dec-19 11:44 AM] cipi#4502
there is a field "gui" in the swap data of every swap: eg `"gui" : "nogui"` ... so that info can be used to determine which GUI was used for the swap... what i don't know is to which side the info applies: taker or maker...


[15-Dec-19 11:46 AM] cipi#4502
could be that it is different on taker and maker... i was maker... and the swap data contains
```"type" : "Maker"
"gui" : "nogui"```
i guess the taker has
```"type" : "Taker"
"gui" : "whatever"```
in the swap with the same uuid


[15-Dec-19 11:59 AM] Alright#0419
is the swap data something we can find after the fact?


[15-Dec-19 12:00 PM] Alright#0419
the issue I see is that not everyone can run a seed node(everyone *can*, but they need users to specify them as a seed node) meaning only a handful of people can get this data


[15-Dec-19 12:00 PM] TonyL#3577
Is what I get from seed DB parsing
```
RICK/MORTY 4582
MORTY/RICK 5645
```


[15-Dec-19 12:00 PM] Alright#0419
I guess for GUI tracking that is not as important, but I made those scripts to enable everyone to be able to get volume data


[15-Dec-19 12:00 PM] Alright#0419
is that completed swaps only @TonyL ?


[15-Dec-19 12:00 PM] TonyL#3577
It's succesfull + unsuccesful


[15-Dec-19 12:01 PM] TonyL#3577

[15-Dec-19 12:03 PM] Alright#0419
ok, yep likely an issue with my script, could you dump txids of each step for me?


[15-Dec-19 12:04 PM] Alright#0419
for every swap 😅


[15-Dec-19 12:04 PM] Alright#0419
oh does that include old RICK/MORTY chains?


[15-Dec-19 12:04 PM] TonyL#3577
yeah, it parsing `all` RICK/MORTY swaps


[15-Dec-19 12:05 PM] TonyL#3577
I can use timestamp of genesis of new RICK/MORTY to filter by time also


[15-Dec-19 12:05 PM] TonyL#3577
lemme try


[15-Dec-19 12:08 PM] TonyL#3577

could you dump all 5 txids of each swap for me please?


[15-Dec-19 12:10 PM] Alright#0419
two separate dumps if you can please, one RICK/MORTY, one MORTY/RICK


[15-Dec-19 12:11 PM] TonyL#3577
sure, let me check how to grab it

@TonyL is it not possible to get dex fee txid as well?

that's mainly what I needed


[15-Dec-19 01:29 PM] Alright#0419
thank you, can try to work with this, but dex fee txids would be most useful


[15-Dec-19 01:52 PM] TonyL#3577

[15-Aug-20 09:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
@Mastermind use https://veruscoin.io/ as Agama is no more. You do not need to use native mode, just use lite mode and you should be able to claim your rewards.

[18-Aug-20 03:11 AM] Oszy#5734
claim rewards at least once a month, it stops accumulating after 30 days


[23-Aug-20 05:57 PM] CryptoSurfer#5372
@Oszy I do it everyday 🤗


[25-Aug-20 10:11 AM] Marx1001#5313
@CryptoSurfer claiming every day is not the best strategy.


[25-Aug-20 10:12 AM] CryptoSurfer#5372
@Marx1001 why?


[25-Aug-20 10:13 AM] Marx1001#5313
@CryptoSurfer you lose about 30 hours every month. When you claim rewards you dont generate rewards for 1 hour.


[25-Aug-20 10:15 AM] CryptoSurfer#5372
@Marx1001 are u sure? When I claim, in a few minutes I go back into my wallet to hit claim again and it’s already started generating


[25-Aug-20 10:16 AM] Marx1001#5313
@CryptoSurfer im sure. It was talked about somewhere. Maybe on telegram.


[25-Aug-20 10:36 AM] CHMEX#0686
That is correct yes


[25-Aug-20 10:36 AM] CHMEX#0686
Better do once each 30 days


[25-Aug-20 11:20 AM] CryptoSurfer#5372
Where is the article or telegram that says that? @CHMEX @Marx1001  because I’ve done it minutes after claiming and it immediately started generating again .

@CHMEX I just read it, it says nothing about this regarding rewards being claimed in AtomicDex mobile.

You need to have a minimum of 10 Komodo in your address as a single UTXO that is about 60 blocks (~60 minutes) old.


[25-Aug-20 11:26 AM] CHMEX#0686
Check that part

@CHMEX when u have that minimum at all times, u can redeem your rewards as many times as you please with no delay in the reward generation starting up again.


[25-Aug-20 11:33 AM] CHMEX#0686
No u have to wait 60mins in between

Once u claim it does not acrue for 60mins

[23-Jan-21 10:06 AM] jspook16#3059
I think it depends from this point forward how much kmd coin utility there is. Currently a user does not need KMD to trade on adex so utility is limited to 0 conf, rewards, and maybe a few other things in the eco system

[23-Jan-21 10:14 AM] jspook16#3059
I was unaware 0 conf was not on mm2. And Ive been trying to put my head to increasing kmd utility. dPoW is a major utility but I dont think someone would need alot of KMD coins for that, or would they?


[23-Jan-21 10:15 AM] jspook16#3059
I think the demand for the coin is what really meant to say. We would need to increase the demand for the coin to move up the ranks


[23-Jan-21 10:52 AM] jspook16#3059
to me thats not alot of kmd to increase demand much.


[23-Jan-21 10:53 AM] jspook16#3059
perhaps when vrsc gets liq pools going, the code can be merged in kmd so that kmd can support pools (and where vrsc pools require VRSC, kmd pools would require KMD). But we would only be competing for the same market at that point


[23-Jan-21 11:10 AM] jspook16#3059
that is an interesting idea. If I understand it correctly, taking the dex fees to create KMD liquidity.


[23-Jan-21 11:11 AM] jspook16#3059
We can also push KMD to be the base on atomic dex. Make KMD the default base....

Several solutions, you can buy on an exchange such as `Binance` or `AtomicDEX`.

You can also mine Komodo.
